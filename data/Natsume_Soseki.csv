From the time I was a boy the reckless streak that runs in my family has brought me nothing but trouble.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Once when I was in elementary school I jumped out of one of the second-story windows and I couldn’t walk for a week.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Some people might wonder why I’d try such a daredevil stunt.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It’s not as if there was any special reason.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was just sticking my head out of a window in the new school building one day, and one of my classmates started making fun of me and saying that even though I acted tough I was really a sissy and I would never jump out that window.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When the school custodian carried me home on his back, my old man was furious and said that he couldn’t believe that somebody couldn’t walk just because they’d jumped out of a second-story window.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I told him that next time I tried that jump I’d walk away from it.I had a nice imported knife that one of my relatives had given me, and once when I was holding it up to the sun to show my friends how shiny the blade was, one of them said that it was shiny all right but it probably wouldn’t cut anything.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I told him that it would cut through anything just fine and if he didn’t believe me I would prove it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He dared me to try cutting my finger with it, so I said all right, just watch, and cut a diagonal slice across my right thumb.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Luckily it was just a small knife and the bone was good and hard, so that thumb is still attached to my hand, but the scar will be there until the day I die.About twenty paces from the east side of our house we had a little vegetable patch with a chestnut tree standing right in the middle.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Those chestnuts meant more to me than life itself.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
When they started to get ripe I would be out the back door as soon as I woke up to pick them up so I could take them to eat at school.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The yard on the west side of our garden belonged to a pawnbroker called Yamashiro-ya.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He had a son named Kantarō who was about thirteen.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Kantarō was a sissy, of course, but he used to climb over the wood-and-bamboo fence and steal our chestnuts.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
One evening I hid out in the shadows by the gate and finally caught him at it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He saw that I’d cut off his escape route, so he jumped me with everything he had.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He was two years older than me, and even though he was a sissy he was strong.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He tried to butt me in the chest with that big flat head of his, but all he managed to do was get it stuck in the sleeve of my kimono.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I couldn’t use my arm with his head stuck in my sleeve, so I just kept waving it around while his head flopped back and forth with it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
When he couldn’t take it any more he bit into my arm.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That really hurt, so I pushed him against the fence and then I tripped him up and threw him over.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Yamashiro-ya’s property was six feet lower than our garden.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Kantarō took a chunk out of the fence as he dropped back over into his own territory with a pathetic moan.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"My sleeve got torn off as he fell, so I could finally move my arm again.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When my mother went over to apologize that night, she managed to get the sleeve back.That wasn’t all – I got into lots of other trouble as well.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There was the time when I got together with Kane-kō the carpenter’s son and Kaku the fish peddler’s son and wrecked old Mosaku’s carrot patch.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He had left some straw spread out on a piece of ground where the carrots hadn’t all come up yet, so the three of us used it as a sumo ring.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"We wrestled there for hours, and by the time we were through the carrots were all trampled flat.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Another time I plugged up the water pipe in the Furukawas’ rice paddy.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
They had a thick tube of hollowed-out bamboo buried deep in the ground with water coming out of it to irrigate the rice plants.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I didn’t know what it was there for, and one day I stuffed the opening full of rocks and twigs until the water stopped coming out.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Later, when I was back home eating dinner, old Mr Furukawa burst in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He was yelling so hard he turned red in the face.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I recall, my parents had to pay him some money to make up for it.My old man never showed any fondness for me, and my mother always favored my older brother.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"His face was so pale it was creepy, and he liked to act out scenes from Kabuki plays – especially the female roles.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Every time the old man laid eyes on me he’d tell me that I’d never amount to much.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
My mother would tell me I was so rough that she worried about what would become of me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, it’s true that I never have amounted to much.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When you look at how things have turned out, it’s no wonder that she was worried.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I have managed to stay out of jail so far, but that’s about as much as I can say for myself.When my mother was sick, only two or three days before she died, I bumped against the stove while I was doing somersaults in the kitchen and bruised my ribs.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It hurt like hell.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"My mother was furious and said that she never wanted to see my face again, so I went off to stay at a relative’s place.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Then the news came that she was dead.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I never thought she would die so soon.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If she was that sick, I really should have behaved better than I did.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I got home, my brother told me that I was a disgrace to the family and that it was because of me that Mother had died so quickly.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was so upset I smacked him in the face, which only got me into even more trouble.After my mother died, I went on living with the old man and my brother.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The old man was the kind of guy who never did anything himself, but all he had to do was catch sight of you and he’d be telling you how you were no good at all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I still can’t figure out why he thought that way.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
One thing was for certain: I had a real character for an old man.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
My brother wanted to become a businessman and was always studying English.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway, he had that feminine streak and he was a sneak, so we didn’t get along.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Every ten days or so we’d get into a fight.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
One time when we were playing chess he caught me with a really sneaky move and then sat there gloating and rubbing it in while I squirmed.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I was so mad that I grabbed one of the pieces and threw it at him.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It hit him right between the eyes, hard enough to draw blood.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He went to tell on me to the old man, who announced that he was going to disinherit me.I figured that I was going to be disinherited just like he said and that was all there was to it, but then Kiyo, the old woman who had been our maid for the last ten years, appealed to him in tears, and he finally cooled down.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even with all this, though, I wasn’t particularly scared of the old man.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Mainly I felt sorry for Kiyo.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"According to the stories I heard she was supposed to be from a respectable family, but when the shogunate was overthrown she was left with nothing and ended up having to work as a servant.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That’s why she was just a humble old woman now.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I don’t know what kind of karmic link there was between the two of us, but for some reason she was tremendously fond of me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was really amazing.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
My mother had had enough of me three days before she died … the old man never had any use for me at all … and everybody in the neighborhood thought I was just a little good-for-nothing and wouldn’t have anything to do with me … but this one old woman was absolutely crazy about me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had already come to the conclusion that I wasn’t the kind of person that anybody could like and it didn’t bother me at all if people treated me as if I was just a block of wood, which only made me wonder all the more why Kiyo fussed over me the way she did.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Sometimes when she was in the kitchen and nobody else was around, she would praise me for having what she called ‘a fine, upstanding character.’ I had no idea what she meant, though.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I figured that if I really had such a fine character, other people should be treating me a little better.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Whenever Kiyo said something like that, I’d tell her that I couldn’t stand being flattered.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then she’d say that it just showed how fine my character really was, and gaze at me adoringly.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She seemed to be taking pride in some version of me that she’d created all by herself.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There was something almost creepy about it.Kiyo grew even fonder of me after my mother died.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Sometimes in my child’s heart I wondered why.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I didn’t appreciate it and wished she would put a stop to it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I thought it was pathetic.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She kept right on spoiling me, though.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Sometimes she would take her own spending money and buy me various kinds of sweets.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
On cold nights she’d slip out and buy some buckwheat flour and after I’d gone to bed she’d come in and leave a steaming bowl of gruel by my pillow.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There were even times when she’d buy me a pot of hot noodle stew.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And it wasn’t just food, either: socks, pencils, notebooks – I got all kinds of presents from her.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Another time – this was much later – she even gave me three yen and told me it was a loan.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It wasn’t as if I had asked her to lend me any money.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She just brought it to my room and said that it must be hard for me without any spending money, so I should take it and use it to get something I wanted.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I told her that I didn’t need it, of course, but she insisted that I should take it, so that’s what I did, and actually I was very glad to have it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I put the three one-yen bills in a purse, stuck it in my kimono – and then went off to the toilet, where I managed to drop it right down the hole.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There was nothing I could do except come slinking back and explain to Kiyo what had happened.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She immediately went and found a bamboo pole and told me that she’d fish it out for me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After a while I heard the sound of splashing water by the well, and when I went to see what was happening, there she was with the cord of my purse hanging from the tip of the pole, trying to rinse it off.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When we opened it up, the bills were all faded and the paper was stained a brownish color.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Kiyo dried them off over the hibachi and gave them back to me, saying that they should be all right now.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I took a sniff.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was pretty bad, and I told her so.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She said I should give them to her and she’d change them for me, and somehow or other she managed to get them exchanged for three silver one-yen coins.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I can’t remember what it was that I bought with those coins.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I told her that I’d pay her back soon, but I never did.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now I wish I could pay her back ten-fold, but it’s not possible any longer.When Kiyo gave me these presents she would always be careful to choose times when the old man and my brother were not around.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now, there’s nothing I hate more than getting something all to myself behind everybody else’s back.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It’s true that I didn’t get along with my brother, but that doesn’t mean that I enjoyed being given sweets and colored pencils without his knowing about it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I asked Kiyo why she was always giving me stuff but never gave my brother anything.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She replied with a straight face that our father would buy things for him, so he didn’t need any presents from her.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This wasn’t really fair.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The old man was hard-headed all right, but he wasn’t the kind to play favorites like that.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I guess it seemed that way to Kiyo, though.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She must have been absolutely crazy about me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even though she came from a good family, she had no education at all, so what could I do?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That’s not all there was to it, either.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The kind of devotion she had for me was downright scary.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She was absolutely certain I was going to have a glorious career and become a wonderfully distinguished man.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"My brother, on the other hand, had nothing going for him but his fair complexion, and would never amount to anything as far as she was concerned.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She had simply convinced herself that people she liked were sure to be big successes, and people she didn’t like were bound to fail, and there was absolutely no way you could talk her out of these notions.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
At that time I didn’t have any particular ideas about what I was going to do with my life.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But because Kiyo kept insisting that I was going to be somebody important, I gradually began to feel it might be true.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It seems ridiculous when I think about it now.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Once I actually asked her what she thought I would become, but it turned out that she didn’t seem to have any more of an idea than I did.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All she was certain of was that I’d travel around town in my own private rickshaw and get myself a house with a magnificent entrance.What’s more, Kiyo had a notion that once I was on my own and had that house, she should come and join me there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Over and over, she asked me to let her live with me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I myself had come to believe that I’d manage to end up with a house of my own somehow, so I told her I’d take her in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She had a tendency to let her imagination run wild, though, and sometimes she’d ask me whether I thought Kōjimachi was a more suitable neighborhood than Azabu, or tell me that it would be nice if we put a swing in the yard, or that one Western-style room would be plenty, as if she was getting it all planned out in advance.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
In those days I didn’t have the least interest in things like owning a house.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Western-style or Japanese, it wasn’t something that I had any use for, so whenever Kiyo started in on her fantasies I would tell her that I didn’t want any of that grand stuff.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then she would praise me again, saying that it just showed how unselfish I was, what a pure heart I had.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter what I said, she could always find some reason to praise me for it.We went on living this way for five or six years after my mother died, with me getting chewed out by the old man, getting into fights with my brother, and getting sweets and compliments from Kiyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I never wished for anything more; things were fine with me just the way they were, and I figured that this must be more or less the way it was for other kids as well.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Still, Kiyo kept telling me what a poor, unfortunate boy I was, and eventually I came to believe that I really was as unfortunate as she said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Other than that there was nothing that bothered me at all, except that the old man would never give me any pocket money.In January of the sixth year after my mother’s death, the old man had a stroke and died.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That April I graduated from a private middle school, and in June my brother graduated from his business school.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He took a job with some company, and was assigned to their office in Kyushu.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I still had to finish my education in Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
My brother announced that he was going to sell off the house and all our parents’ possessions before heading off to Kyushu.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I told him he could do whatever he wanted as far as I was concerned.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter what, I didn’t want to feel beholden to him for anything.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And even if he did try to take care of me, I knew that he wouldn’t miss a chance to use it against me when we got into a quarrel, which we were bound to do sooner or later anyway.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I wasn’t about to bow down to a brother like him just so I could get whatever help he might be willing to give me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I figured that there would always be something I could do to get by on my own – even if it meant that I’d have to work as a milkman, well, I was ready.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
My brother brought in a dealer in second-hand goods and sold off all the junk that had accumulated in our house from generation to generation for next to nothing.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He got somebody to help him unload the house and land, and they managed to find a wealthy buyer.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It seems that he made a lot of money off the deal, but I don’t know any of the details.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I had already moved out a month before and taken a room in a boardinghouse in Kanda until I could figure out my next move.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Kiyo was very upset that the house she had been serving in for more than ten years was being let go, but it wasn’t hers so there was nothing she could do about it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Over and over she lamented that if only I had been a little bit older I could have inherited the place myself.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Of course, if I could have inherited it when I was a little older, I should have been entitled to inherit it just as easily right then.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The old woman didn’t understand how these things work at all, so she actually thought that getting older was all it took for you to inherit an older brother’s property.So my brother and I went our separate ways, but there was still the problem of where Kiyo should go.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"My brother was hardly in a position to take her with him, of course, and besides she didn’t have the slightest interest in trailing along after him all the way out to Kyushu.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But I was holed up in my nine-foot-square room in a cheap boardinghouse at that point, and for all I knew I might even be forced to get out at any time.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There was nothing that either of us could do for her.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Finally I put the question to Kiyo herself.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked if she was planning to go into service in some other house, she said that until I had a home of my own and got married, she had no choice but to move in with her nephew and that was what she’d decided to do.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This nephew was a clerk in the courts, reasonably well off, and he had already invited Kiyo to come and live with him if she was so minded on a couple of occasions, but she’d always turned down the offer, saying that she preferred staying on in a place that she’d been used to for years, even as a maid.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This time, though, she must have decided that moving in with him would be better than starting over as a servant in some unfamiliar household where she’d have to worry all the time about fitting in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Still, she said, I should get myself a house and a wife as soon as possible and she’d come and take care of me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She must have preferred me, even though I wasn’t a flesh-and-blood relative, to her nephew who was one.Two days before my brother left for Kyushu, he came around to my boardinghouse and presented me with six hundred yen.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He said that I could use it as capital to set myself up in some business, or to pay for continuing my education – whatever I did with it was up to me, but I shouldn’t expect anything more from him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
By my brother’s standards this was a pretty impressive move.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It wasn’t as if it would have bothered me if he hadn’t given me the money, but I admired him for handling the situation like a man, so I accepted it and thanked him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then he took out another fifty yen and told me to give it to Kiyo, which I gladly agreed to do.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Two days later we said goodbye at Shinbashi Station, and I haven’t seen him since.Lying on my bedding, I thought about what to do with the six hundred yen.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Going into business would be a real bother, and I wouldn’t be able to make a go of it anyway, especially since it didn’t seem very likely that you could set yourself up in any kind of decent business with only six hundred yen.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even if you could, the way the world is now you’d always be at a disadvantage unless you could present yourself in society as an educated man.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Forget about using the money as capital; I’d study something, I decided, and use it for tuition.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I split it into three parts, I could study for three years, with two hundred yen to spend each year.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
If I gave it everything I had for three years I should be able to accomplish something.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The next question to consider was what kind of school to go to, but I had never taken a liking to any of the subjects.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Language and literature?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Certainly not – when it came to stuff like modern poetry, I couldn’t even understand one line out of twenty.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was thinking that it really didn’t matter what field I chose since I was sure not to like it anyway, but then as luck would have it I happened to walk past the Institute of Physical Sciences and saw a sign saying STUDENTS WANTED.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This, I figured, was meant to be, so I took a look at their list of regulations, and signed up right then and there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I think about it now, I realize that this was another one of those blunders I owe to that reckless streak which runs in the family.For three years I studied about as hard as everybody else, but I wasn’t particularly good at it and if you looked for my name in the class rankings you would have had an easier time finding it if you started from the bottom.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Still, incredible as it seemed, when the three years were up I managed to graduate.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I couldn’t help thinking that it was kind of odd, but since it wouldn’t have made any sense to lodge a complaint, I accepted the diploma without protest.Eight days after I graduated I was summoned by the headmaster.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I reported to his office, wondering what it was about, I was told that there was an opening for a mathematics teacher in a middle school somewhere out in Shikoku, paying forty yen a month.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Was I interested?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, the idea that I might become a teacher, or that I might go and live in the provinces, had never even occurred to me despite having just spent three years at my studies.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But of course I didn’t have any ideas about doing something other than teaching, either, so I agreed on the spot.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Once again, that reckless streak did me in.Since I had accepted the offer, I had to go.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
In the three years I’d been holed up in my nine-foot-square room I hadn’t had to put up with a single critical remark.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I hadn’t gotten into any fights.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Compared to what came before and after, it was a pretty carefree phase of my life.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But now I’d have to leave my little room behind.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The only time I had been out of Tokyo in my entire life was when I went on an excursion to Kamakura with some of my classmates.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This time it would be nowhere as close by as Kamakura – I’d be going somewhere awfully far away.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I looked for it on a map, I saw that it was on the coast, no bigger than a pinpoint.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It couldn’t be much of a place.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I didn’t have a clue what the town or the people who lived there were like.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That didn’t matter, though.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There was no point worrying.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I would just go.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All the same, it was kind of a bother.I had gone to visit Kiyo a number of times since we had gotten rid of the old house.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Her nephew turned out to be a surprisingly fine person.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He would always go out of his way to be nice to me if he was at home when I visited.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Kiyo would sing my praises to him – she would even announce that I was going to buy a mansion in Kōjimachi and get a good job with the government as soon as I graduated.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since she had taken it on herself to chart my life out this way, these conversations were kind of hard for me and all I could do was sit there and blush.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
And it wasn’t only once or twice that this happened.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Sometimes she would even talk about the way I wet my bed when I was little, which was enough to make me squirm.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I don’t know what the nephew was thinking as he listened to Kiyo carrying on like this.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At any rate, she was an old-fashioned kind of woman, and she thought of our relationship in terms of the master-retainer relations of feudal times.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She seemed to believe that if I was her master, then I ranked as her nephew’s master as well.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It must have been pretty embarrassing for him!In due course it was officially confirmed that I had been hired.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Three days before I set out, I went to see Kiyo, but she was down with a cold, lying in a little room on the north side of the house.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When she saw me there it seemed to boost her spirits right away, and she sat up and asked when I was going to get a house of my own.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She had this idea that all you had to do was graduate and the money would just start sprouting in your pocket.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What was even more ridiculous was the way she was still calling me Botchan, even though in her mind I was now a man of substance, not some little boy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It would be no simple thing for me to get a house any time soon.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I told her I was going to the country, she looked terribly disappointed and kept stroking the loose hairs at her graying temples over and over again.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I felt so sorry for her that I tried to cheer her up by saying ‘I have to go, but I’ll be back soon.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’ll be back next year at summer vacation for sure.’ She still had a funny look on her face, so I asked ‘What kind of souvenir should I bring back for you?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What would you like?’ ‘I’d like some of those sweets from Echigo that come wrapped in bamboo leaves,’ she said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had never heard of anything like that, and besides Echigo was in a different direction from where I was headed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I replied that I didn’t think they had those in the part of the country I was going to, she asked ‘Which direction are you going, then?’ ‘West,’ I said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then she asked ‘Past Hakone, or on this side?’ I didn’t know how to even begin to explain.The morning I left she came to my room and helped out with all kinds of things.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She gave me a canvas bag with a toothbrush, tooth powder, and a towel she’d bought in a shop on the way over.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I told her I didn’t need them, but she wouldn’t take no for an answer.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"We rode to the station in two rickshaws, side by side.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After I had boarded the train she stood there on the platform, gazing at me through the window.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘We may not see each other again.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Please take very good care of yourself,’ she said in a tiny voice.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Her eyes were filled with tears.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Mine weren’t, but it was all I could do to keep myself from crying.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Once the train started to pick up speed I thought I would be all right and I stuck my head out the window and looked back.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She was still standing there.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Somehow she looked awfully small.2When the ship came to a stop with a blast from its whistle, a barge pulled out from the shore and was rowed over to us.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The boatman was stark naked except for a red loincloth.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What a barbaric place!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Of course, he probably couldn’t stand wearing a kimono in that searing heat.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The sun beat down so fiercely that the water shone with a nasty glint to it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just looking at it was enough to make your eyes swim.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I asked the purser if this was where I was supposed to get off and he said it was.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
From the look of it the place was a fishing town about the size of the neighborhood of ōmori in Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Who the hell did they think they were, sending me to a place like this?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How was I supposed to stand it?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, there was nothing I could do about it now.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I jumped down onto the barge ahead of everybody else, and five or six people got on after me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
They loaded a couple of big boxes on too and then Redloin rowed us in to the shore.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
When we landed I was again the first one to jump off.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Right away I grabbed a runny-nosed kid who was standing there and asked him where the middle school was, but he just gawked at me and said ‘I dunno.’ The dim-witted hick!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The whole town wasn’t any bigger than a cat’s forehead, so how could you not know where the middle school was?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just then a man in a strange-looking kimono with tight sleeves walked up and said ‘Come with me’ and when I followed along he led me to an inn called Minato-ya or something like that.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"A bunch of nasty-looking maids all joined voices to greet me, which just made me want to have nothing to do with the place.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I stopped in the entryway and asked them where the middle school was.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When they told me that it was a couple of miles away by train, I was even more determined not to stay here.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I snatched my two valises from the guy in the tight-sleeved kimono and started walking.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The people in the inn gave me a strange look.I found the train station soon enough and bought myself a ticket.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I got on the train, it looked as dinky as a matchbox.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It had hardly started to get rolling when it was already time to get off; the whole ride couldn’t have taken more than five minutes.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No wonder the ticket was so cheap, I thought – only three sen!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I got into a rickshaw and set off for the middle school, but when I got there, classes were already over for the day and there was no one around.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The custodian explained that the teacher on night duty had just gone out on an errand.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"For somebody who was supposed to be on night duty, he seemed to have a pretty casual attitude.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I thought about paying a call on the Principal, but by this point I was already feeling so worn out that I just got back in the rickshaw and told the driver to take me to an inn.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He dashed me off to a place called Yamashiro-ya – the same name as the pawnbroker’s shop that Kantarō’s family ran, which was kind of funny.For some reason the maid showed me to a dark room beneath the stairway.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was so hot I couldn’t stand it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I told her I didn’t want this room she replied that unfortunately all the others were occupied and walked away, leaving my valises just where she had dropped them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There was nothing I could do about it, so I went in and sat there sweating.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Eventually they told me that the bath was ready, so I headed for the bathroom and plunged right in, but came out just as quickly.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"On my way back, I took a look around and noticed that there were actually plenty of nice, cool-looking rooms open.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was outrageous – what a pack of liars!!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"By and by, a maid came around with my dinner tray.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The room was as hot as ever, but the food was a lot better than what they gave me in my old boardinghouse.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As she was serving the meal, the maid asked me where I was from, and I told her.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Tokyo must be a very nice place, she said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It sure is, I said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After I finished and the maid went back to the kitchen with my tray, I could hear some people laughing out loud.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since there was nothing worth staying up for in a place like this I went right to bed, but it wasn’t that easy to fall asleep.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The heat wasn’t the only problem – it was noisy, too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The racket was five times worse than it had been at the boardinghouse.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I finally drifted off, I had a dream about Kiyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She was wolfing down some of those Echigo sweets, bamboo-leaf wrappers and all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I told her that bamboo leaves are poisonous and she shouldn’t be eating them, but she said no, this kind is good for you and went on devouring them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Dumbfounded, I started roaring with laughter.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
At this point I woke up.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
A maid was opening the shutters.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The sky was just as wonderfully clear as it had been the day before.I had been told that when you take a trip, you’re supposed to tip; if you don’t, people won’t treat you the way you deserve.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They must have stuck me in this dark little room because I didn’t hand out any tips; my shabby-looking outfit, canvas valises, and imitation satin umbrella couldn’t have helped either.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
As if this bunch of hicks had the right to look down their noses at anybody!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, I’d show them: let them have a tip that would be sure to give them a nice big shock.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter how unimpressive I might have looked to them, I had thirty yen left in my pocket from my savings when I set out from Tokyo, and after paying for the train and boat fare and the rest of my travel expenses I still had fourteen left.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And now I’d have my salary coming in, so even if I let them have all fourteen it wouldn’t be a problem.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Country people are cheapskates; a five-yen tip would surely be enough to make their eyes pop.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just wait till you get a look at this, I thought, as I coolly went off to wash my face, and then went back to my room and waited.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The same girl from last night brought in my breakfast.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As she served it, she kept breaking into an obnoxious smirk.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Outrageous!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What did she think she was gawking at, some kind of stage show?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even a face like mine was a lot more impressive sight than hers was, that much was for sure.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had been intending to wait until after she was through serving to hand over my tip, but I was feeling so angry I just took out a five-yen bill right then and there and told her to take it to the office.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She gave me a strange look.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
After I finished breakfast I set out for the school right away.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
My shoes had been left unshined.I had a pretty clear idea of how to get to the school since I had gone there in the rickshaw the day before.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just a couple of turns and I was right at the gate.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The pathway from the gate to the school entrance was paved with slabs of granite, and the noise the rickshaw made as it rattled over them had been hard to take.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
As I was walking along I had seen lots of students in their heavy black uniforms; now they were all streaming through this gate.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Some of them were taller than I was, and they looked stronger, too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When it hit me that I was supposed to be teaching kids like them, it made me feel kind of uneasy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I presented my name card and was ushered into the Principal’s office.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Principal had a thin mustache, a dark complexion, and big eyes that made him look like a badger.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
His manner was horribly stuffy.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He urged me to do my best and then solemnly handed me a Certificate of Appointment with a huge seal stamped on it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"(Later, when I was on the boat on my way back to Tokyo, I took this certificate, crumpled it up, and pitched it into the sea.)",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Next, he told me that he was going to present me to the rest of the teaching staff, and that I should display my Certificate personally to each of them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What a lot of bother!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It would have been less trouble just to hang it up in the faculty room for a couple of days.The entire faculty wouldn’t be assembling in the staff room until the first-period bugle sounded, which wouldn’t be for a while yet.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Principal pulled out his pocket watch, gave it a glance, and announced that he planned to have a long, leisurely talk with me later on, but to begin with he wanted me to understand the main points in a general way; then launched into a lengthy discourse on the Spirit of Education.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I just stood there more or less taking it in, of course, but as he droned on I began to think that I had let myself in for a lot of trouble by coming here.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There was no way I could do what this Principal was expecting.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Telling a reckless character like me that I was to be a role model for the students, and that I would be required to conduct myself in such a way that I would be looked up to by everyone in the school, and that a true educator is one who not only imparts knowledge but exerts a positive moral influence in his personal life – this was asking for a lot more than he had any reasonable right to expect.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Did he really think that anyone of such distinction was going to come all the way out to some country town like this for forty yen a month?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It had always seemed to me that all people are pretty much the same, and if something gets them angry enough they’re bound to get themselves into a fight or two.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At this rate, though, I’d just have to hold my tongue; in fact, I could hardly even go out for a walk!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If the assignment was so demanding, they should have explained exactly what was involved before they’d hired me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I don’t like lying, so there was no way out of it: I just had to face the fact that I’d come here based on a misapprehension, and make up my mind to give up the job and head for home right away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now that I’d given the people at the inn that five-yen bill, all I had left was nine yen and change – not enough to get me back to Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What a blunder that tip had been!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even with only nine yen, though, things would work out one way or another.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even if it wasn’t enough to cover my trip home, it was still better than lying.When I informed the Principal that I couldn’t possibly live up to the expectations he had for me and was therefore returning my Certificate of Appointment, he blinked those badger eyes of his and gazed into my face for a few moments.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then he laughed and said that what he had been talking about before was simply his ideal, and he was well aware that I wouldn’t be able to live up to it so there was no need for me to worry.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, if he was so sure of this all along, why did he have to intimidate me with that speech to begin with?By and by the bugle sounded and we could hear a wave of boisterous noise from the classrooms.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Principal said that the teachers should all be assembled in the faculty room by now, so I followed behind him and went in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They were all sitting at their desks, which were lined up along the walls of the long, narrow room.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As soon as I entered they all turned to look at me, as if by some prearranged agreement.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Did they think I was going to put on some kind of show for them?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I went around to each one, presented my Certificate for their inspection, and delivered a formal greeting, just as I had been instructed to do.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Most of them just rose a little out of their seats and bowed, but some took the ceremony more seriously and actually accepted the Certificate when I offered it to them, made a show of reading it over, and solemnly handed it back.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It felt as if everybody was just play-acting.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
By the time I got around to the fifteenth one – the physical education teacher – I was beginning to feel a bit on edge from having delivered the same greeting over and over again.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Each of them only had to do this once, but I had to repeat it fifteen times.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They should have tried giving a little thought to how it felt for the other person!One of the people I greeted as I was making my rounds was the Assistant Principal, but I didn’t catch his name.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This Mr Something-or-Other was supposed to be a Bachelor of Arts, a genuine university graduate, which meant that he had to be an important person.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He spoke in a gentle voice that had a strangely feminine tone to it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What really surprised me, though, was the flannel shirt he was wearing, despite the heat.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter how thin the fabric might have been, it must have felt terribly warm.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Leave it to a university graduate to go above and beyond the call like that, I guess.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What’s more, it was a red shirt – much too fancy for the likes of us.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Later I found out that this fellow wore a red shirt all year round.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This was a strange case!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"According to him, wearing red was good for your health, so he got these shirts of his made to order.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He shouldn’t have bothered – after all, if wearing red was so good for you, you might as well make your whole outfit red!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then there was the English teacher, named Koga, who had a terribly greenish, sickly-looking complexion.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Pasty-faced people usually tend to be on the slim side, but this fellow’s face had a puffy look.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I was a kid in grade school, I had a classmate called Tami-san whose old man had the same kind of coloring.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He was a farmer, so one day I asked Kiyo if that was what happened to you if you became a farmer.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She said it wasn’t; the problem, she explained, was that he was always eating the pale squashes that grow right at the tip of the vine when the plant is past its prime, and that’s how he got so pale and puffy-looking himself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Ever since then, whenever I’ve seen someone with a pasty, puffy face like that I’ve figured that they must have gotten that way by eating those squashes.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This English teacher must have been eating a load of them, too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Actually, I still don’t really understand what makes those squashes pale; when I asked Kiyo about it again she just laughed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I guess she didn’t really know either.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Next was the other mathematics teacher, whose name was Hotta.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He was a rugged-looking fellow with short, bristly hair and a face that could have belonged to one of the rougher customers among the warrior monks of old.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He didn’t even bother to glance at the Certificate that I was politely holding out to him; instead he said ‘Oh, so you’re the new guy, are you?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, come on over to my place sometime,’ and gave me a big, hearty laugh.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I couldn’t see what was so funny.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Who did he think would want to hang around with the likes of him if he was going to act so rude?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I decided to call him the Porcupine because of the way his hair stood up.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Chinese classics teacher, as you might expect, was a stiff, formal type: ‘Having only arrived yesterday, I fear you must be rather fatigued.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
And then to commence instruction immediately – most commendable!’ There was something kind of charming about the way the old fellow rambled on.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The art teacher looked like some bit player out of a theatrical company – sheer silk jacket over his kimono, flicking at the air with his fan.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘And where, my good man, might you be from?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Tokyo?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Ah, splendid, now I won’t be so alone: I’m not ashamed to say I’m a Tokyo native myself … ’ If this is what passes for a Tokyo man, I thought to myself, I would rather have been born someplace else.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I could fill you in with the same kinds of details for all the others, but I wouldn’t know where to put an end to it, so I’ll just stop here.Once the formalities were more or less over, the Principal told me that that would do for today, and I should assume my duties in two days after having duly consulted with the head mathematics instructor about curricular matters.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked who this was, I was informed that it was the Porcupine, whom I’ve already mentioned.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Damn it – this is the guy that I’d have to work under?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Oh no!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I could feel my heart sinking.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘Where are you staying?’ the Porcupine asked.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘Yamashiro-ya?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All right, I’ll stop by soon and we can talk things over.’ Before I could reply he grabbed his chalk and strode out the door toward his classroom.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Any head instructor who would go to pay a call on his subordinate couldn’t have much of a sense of appropriate behavior.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Still, I had to admire him for not standing on ceremony.At that point I was going to just go back through the school gate and head right back to my inn, but since there wasn’t anything special for me to do when I got there, I decided to take a little stroll around the town instead, with no particular destination in mind.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I saw the prefectural government building.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was an old one, left over from another era.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I also saw the local army barracks.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
They weren’t as impressive as the Azabu barracks back in Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I took a look at the main street.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was only about half as broad as the one in Kagurazaka, and the buildings were a lot less impressive, too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This was supposed to have been a pretty big castle town in the old days, but you really couldn’t expect much from such a place.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I walked along feeling sorry for all the locals who were so proud to be residents of a castle town, I suddenly found myself back in front of Yamashiro-ya.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The town wasn’t as big as it might have seemed.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I had probably already seen just about everything there was to see.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I went inside, ready for lunch.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As soon as she saw me in the entryway, the lady who ran the establishment jumped up from the front counter where she’d been sitting and welcomed me back with a bow so low that her head touched the floor.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I took my shoes off and stepped into the lobby, a maid appeared and took me up to the second floor where, she said, a good room was now available.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Not only was it on the second floor, it was a fifteen-mat room, fifteen feet by eighteen, on the front side of the building, with an imposing alcove.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Never in my life had I been in such a fancy room before.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Thinking that there was no telling when I might have another chance to stay in another one like it, I immediately took off my suit, changed into a thin robe, and lay down right in the middle of the room with my arms and legs stretched out as wide as they would go.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It felt wonderful!After lunch I wrote a letter to Kiyo.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’m not much good at putting phrases together and I can’t remember how to write a lot of the words, so I hate writing letters.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It’s not like there had ever been anybody that I had to write to, either, but I knew that Kiyo must be worrying about me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I wouldn’t want her to think that I had drowned in a shipwreck or anything, so I gave it everything I had and wrote her a good long one.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This is what it said:I got here yesterday.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It’s a nothing place.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’m staying in a 15-mat room.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I gave them a 5-yen tip and the lady who runs the place bowed down so low she scraped her forehead on the floor.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Last night I couldn’t get to sleep.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I dreamed that you were eating those sweets, bamboo-leaf wrappers and all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’ll be back next summer.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Today I went to school and I gave all the teachers nicknames.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The Principal is the Badger.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The Assistant Principal is Redshirt.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The English teacher is the Pale Squash, the other math teacher is the Porcupine, and the art teacher is the Hanger-on.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’ll write you more about it later.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Goodbye!I was feeling nice and relaxed after I finished my letter, so I stretched out on the floor in the middle of the room again and drifted off to sleep.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This time I slept really soundly, no dreams at all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I only woke up when I heard somebody bellowing ‘Is this the room?’ and saw the Porcupine walk in.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Before I was even completely awake, he was already getting the proceedings under way: ‘Sorry about this morning.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now, your classes are … ’ At first I was so stunned I could hardly follow what he was saying, but as I listened I realized that the classes he was assigning me didn’t sound particularly difficult, so I just went along with it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If that was all there was to it, he could have asked me to start right in the next day, never mind the day after.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Once that was settled he announced, as if he had the whole thing worked out already, that I obviously couldn’t be planning on staying at this inn very long, and that he knew a good place to stay where they wouldn’t rent a room to just anybody but if he put in a good word for me they’d be sure to take me in, so I should get ready to move right away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It would be a good idea to have a look at the place today and get going as soon as possible, he added, so that I could get moved in the next day before my teaching duties began.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was true that I couldn’t hope to stay on in this fancy room indefinitely; it might cost more than my whole salary for all I knew.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was too bad that I’d have to leave so soon after laying out that five yen tip.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But since I was going to leave eventually anyhow it made sense to leave right away and get settled into a new place, so I asked the Porcupine to make the arrangements.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He told me that I should go along with him and have a look, so I did.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was a very quiet place, on the side of a hill at the edge of town.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The owner was an antiques dealer who went by the name of Ikagin; his wife looked to be a couple of years older than he was.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I was in middle school I had learned the word ‘witch’ in English class, and this lady looked just like one.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even if she was a witch, of course, it wasn’t me that she was married to, so I didn’t mind.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
We settled it that I would move in the next day.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
On the way back to the inn the Porcupine treated me to a dish of shaved ice.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I’d first met him at school I’d thought he was awfully rude and arrogant, but now that I saw him doing these things for me, he didn’t seem so bad after all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I guess it was just that he was impulsive, plus he had a temper – the same as me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Later I heard that he was the most popular teacher with the students.3Finally it was time to head to school.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The first time I walked into a classroom and stood up on the raised platform in front of the blackboard it felt kind of funny.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I went through my lecture, I was wondering to myself if maybe someone like me might actually make it as a teacher after all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The pupils were a rowdy bunch.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Now and then one of them would shout out ‘Sir!’ in a voice that was ridiculously loud.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That shook me a little.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had addressed my teachers the same way every day at the Institute of Physical Sciences, but there’s a world of difference between calling your teachers ‘Sir’ and hearing students call you that.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It gave me a sort of creepy-crawly feeling in the soles of my feet.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’m not a sneaky person, and I’m no coward, either, but unfortunately my nerves aren’t as steady as they might be.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Each time I was hit by one of those voices shouting ‘Sir!’ it made me feel the way I did back when I’d hear the noontime cannon suddenly boom out on the Imperial Palace grounds and I was on an empty stomach.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I managed to get through the first class all right, but I didn’t have to handle any particularly tough questions.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I went back to the faculty room, the Porcupine asked me how it went.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I just nodded, which seemed to be good enough for him.When I took my chalk and headed out for the second class, I felt as if I was marching off into enemy territory.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
In this class all the kids were bigger than me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Being a real Tokyo native, I have a slight build, plus I’m on the short side, so even when I stood up on that teacher’s platform I couldn’t say that I looked very imposing.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When it comes to fighting I’m ready to take on anybody, even a sumo wrestler, but if you put me in front of a class of forty big squirts and ask me to keep them in line just by wagging my tongue, well, that’s beyond me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But I reckoned that if I showed any weakness in front of these hicks they’d never let up on me, so I let them have my lecture as loud as I could make it, with a dash of Tokyo accent thrown in for good measure.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At first they looked dazed, as if they were lost in a fog.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now I had them where I wanted them, so I decided to pour on a little more and started throwing in some tough-sounding Tokyo slang, at which point the kid sitting right in the middle of the front row, the strongest-looking kid in the whole class, suddenly stood up and said ‘Sir!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"!’ Here we go, I thought.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked him what he wanted, he said, ‘Well, umm, when you talk so fast it’s hard to understand, umm, could you slow down just a little bit if you don’t mind – na moshi.’ This ‘if you don’t mind na moshi’ sounded awfully wishy-washy to me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All right, I said, if this is too fast for you I’ll talk slower, but I’m from Tokyo and I can’t talk the way you do; if you can’t understand, just bear with it until you can.Taking this approach I got through the second class more easily than I expected.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But then as I was almost out the door one of the students came up to me with a geometry problem and said ‘Could you show me how to solve this problem if you don’t mind – na moshi.’ It was so hard I didn’t have a clue.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I broke into a cold sweat.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All I could do was tell him that I couldn’t figure it out on the spot but I’d explain it next time, and get out of there in a hurry.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Before I could escape, though, the boys started squealing with delight, and I could hear some of them chanting ‘He can’t do it!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He can’t do it!’ The damned fools!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Of course I couldn’t solve a problem that hard, even if I was their teacher!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What’s so funny about saying you can’t do it if you really can’t?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I was good enough to figure out a problem like that, why would I have come all the way out here to the sticks for a measly forty yen a month?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I went back to the faculty room and the Porcupine asked me how the class had gone, I nodded again, but this time it wasn’t enough of a report, so I told him that the students in this school seemed like a pretty thick-headed crew.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He gave me a strange kind of look.The third class, the fourth, and the one in the afternoon all proceeded in more or less the same way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In each of my classes that first day, something or other went slightly wrong.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I realized that being a teacher isn’t nearly as easy as it looks.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had made it through all my classes for the day, but I couldn’t go home yet.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I would have to sit around waiting, with my mind a blank, until three o’clock.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then, I’d been informed, I would have to do an inspection of my homeroom after the students had finished cleaning it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I would also have to go over my attendance lists.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Only then would I be free to go home.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just because you’ve sold yourself for a salary, does that give them the right to make you sit around with nothing to do, just staring at your desk?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But if everybody else was willing to put up with these rules without complaining, I realized, it would hardly do for a newcomer like me to raise a fuss, and so I just sat there too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As we were leaving, I vented my frustration to the Porcupine: ‘You know, it’s ridiculous that they make us stay till three, no matter what.’ At first he just said ‘Yeah, it’s true,’ and laughed, but then he turned serious and added a warning: ‘Look, you’d better not complain too much about this school.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And if you do, make sure you only do it to me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There are some pretty strange people around here.’ We parted ways at a corner before there was time for me to hear any more.When I got home, the landlord came into my room and asked if I’d like him to make some tea.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I thought he meant that he was going to offer me some of his own, but instead he took mine, and helped himself to a cup into the bargain.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"For all I knew, he may have been inviting himself to enjoy my tea while I was off at school as well.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He explained that he had always been interested in antiques, and so eventually he had started to do some dealing in a private way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘I sense that you are a gentleman of quite sophisticated tastes.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"How would you like to start a little collection of your own, just for fun?’ Not on your life!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was true that once a couple of years ago I’d been mistaken for a locksmith at the Imperial Hotel when I had gone there on an errand.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Another time, when I was walking around near the Great Statue of the Buddha in Kamakura wearing a blanket over my head, one of the rickshawmen started addressing me as ‘Boss.’ I had been taken for plenty of other things as well over the years, but nobody had ever accused me of being a gentleman of quite sophisticated tastes before!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You can usually tell everything you need to know about people from the way they look, or what they’re wearing.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’ve seen what a man of sophisticated tastes is supposed to look like in those old ink paintings: they’re wearing some kind of monk’s cowl, or holding a slip of paper so they’ll always be ready to dash off a poem.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Anybody who tried to put me in that category with a straight face would have to be a really suspicious character.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I told him that as far as I was concerned collecting antiques was a pastime best left to idle old men, and I had no use for it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He laughed and said no, it’s true that nobody starts out with an interest in it, but once people develop a feel for it they rarely turn back.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Meanwhile he poured himself some more of my tea and drank it with a peculiar flourish.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had actually asked him to buy some tea for me the night before, but this was awful stuff, bitter and thick.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
A single cup was enough to make your stomach feel funny.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked him to look for something less bitter next time he said ‘Yes sir,’ and helped himself to yet another serving, tipping the pot and holding it there long enough to make sure that he had squeezed out whatever last drops of flavor were left in the leaves.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That’s the kind of guy he was: as long as it was somebody else’s tea, he was going to drink as much of it as he could.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After he left, I did a little preparation for the next day’s classes and then went to bed.The days began to take on a regular pattern: walk to school in the morning, do my job, then come back to my room, where my landlord would soon drop in and ask if I’d like some tea.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After a week of this I had a pretty good idea of what was what at school, and also of what kind of people the landlord and his wife were.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had heard from some of the other teachers that for their first week or month on the job they had been very worried about whether they were making a good impression or not, but that wasn’t the way I felt at all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I made mistakes in class I would feel bad about it, but after thirty minutes or so I had forgotten about it completely.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’m not the kind of guy who can worry about things for long even if I try.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was completely unconcerned with the effect my slip-ups in class might have on the students, or with what the Principal and Assistant Principal might think.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Like I said before, my nerves aren’t that steady, but once I take a stand I’ll stick to it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was ready to pack up and leave at any time if things didn’t work out at this school, so the Badger and Redshirt didn’t faze me at all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And as for those kids in my classes, I was even less tempted to bother with trying to keep on their good side.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This approach worked fine at school, but at home things weren’t so simple.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If it was just the landlord dropping in to drink up my tea it wouldn’t have been so bad, but he kept bringing various stuff to show me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"First it was a bunch of things he called ‘inzai’ or some such name, little bars of stone that you could carve a seal on; he laid out about ten of them and said that he’d give me the lot for the bargain price of three yen.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since I wasn’t some kind of second-rate journeyman artist who needed a bunch of fancy seals to make his work look good I had no use for them, and I told him so; then he unrolled a hanging scroll, a traditional-style bird and flower picture, and told me it was painted by a man named Kazan or something like that.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He hung it up in the alcove himself, and asked ‘Don’t you think it’s a splendidly executed piece?’ I guess so, I said, just to say something, at which point he launched into a long-winded explanation of how there were two painters named Kazan – Something-or-other Kazan and another Something-or-other Kazan – and this scroll was by one of the Something-or-other Kazans and not the other.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then he urged me to buy it, adding that just for me he’d bring the price down to fifteen yen.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I told him that I didn’t have that kind of money, he said it was no problem, I could pay whenever it suited me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The man simply wouldn’t take no for an answer.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I finally got rid of him by telling him that I wouldn’t buy it even if I did have the money.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Another time he lugged in a giant inkstone, as big as a gargoyle roof tile, and announced ‘This is a Tankei stone, a Tankei.’ Before he could repeat himself again, I decided to play dumb and asked him what a Tankei was, but that only got him started on another lecture.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The inkstones of Tankei, he explained, were quarried from three different veins of rock: upper, middle, and lower.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All of the stones on the market these days were from the upper level, but this one was a genuine middle-level stone.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Just look at these eyes,’ he said, pointing to some lighter spots in the blackish stone.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘You won’t see many specimens with three eyes like this.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Feels absolutely superb when you glide your ink stick over it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Please, go ahead, give it a try.’ As he shoved the thing in front of me I asked him what the price was.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘The owner brought it back with him from China and he says he’s very eager to sell it, so I think we could let you have it for only thirty yen.’ The man must have been out of his mind.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At school it was looking like I’d be able to get by somehow or other, but there was no way I could hold up much longer under this trial by antiques.Before long school started to become a problem too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"One evening while I was taking a stroll in a neighborhood called ōmachi, I saw a little shop next to the Post Office with a sign that said TOKYO BUCKWHEAT NOODLES.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I love buckwheat noodles.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I was in Tokyo, just passing a noodle shop and getting a whiff of the spicy, simmering broth was enough to make me want to dash right in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now, with my head stuffed with mathematics and antiques, I had forgotten all about noodles, but once I caught sight of that sign I just couldn’t pass it by, so I decided to go right in and have a bowl.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I looked around inside, I saw that the sign had gotten my hopes up in vain.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since it said TOKYO, you’d expect a slightly more decent-looking place; maybe they didn’t know what they were doing, or maybe they didn’t have the money to fix it up, but anyway it was horribly filthy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The floor mats had turned brown with age, and there was so much dirt rubbed into them that they had a scratchy feel.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The walls were black with soot.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The ceiling was stained with smoke from kerosene lamps and, even worse, it was so low that I found myself keeping my head down all the time without even thinking about it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The only thing that looked brand new was the price list hanging on the wall, with the names of the different dishes written out in a flowery hand.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It looked as though they must have bought a dilapidated old building and just opened for business a couple of days ago.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The first item on the list was tempura noodles.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Give me a bowl of the tempura,’ I shouted.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As soon as I ordered, a group of three customers over in the corner, who up to that point had been slurping away at their own noodles, all turned to look at me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I hadn’t noticed before – it was so dark in there – but when our eyes met I realized that they were all students from the school.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They all bowed by way of greeting, so I did the same.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The noodles were good and it had been a long time since I’d had any, so I polished off four bowls, all with tempura.The next day I walked into my classroom just as I would any other day, only to find that someone had written the words MISTER TEMPURA in giant letters on the blackboard.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
As soon as the students saw me they burst into raucous laughter.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The whole thing seemed so stupid, I asked them what was so funny about somebody eating tempura.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"One of them answered: ‘But four bowls is too much, na moshi.’ I told them that as long as I paid for them and I ate them, it wasn’t any of their business if I had four bowls, five, or any other number I wanted.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Then I rushed through my lecture and headed straight back to the faculty room.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I got to the next class ten minutes later, I found another message on the board: FOUR BOWLS OF TEMPURA – LAUGHTER STRICTLY PROHIBITED.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The first time around I hadn’t minded that much, but this time I was really upset.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
When you overdo a joke it just becomes obnoxious.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It’s like overcooking a rice cake until it gets all charred and tough: you can hardly expect anybody to be impressed.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But country people haven’t figured out this principle, and they seem to think that it’s okay to keep pouring it on indefinitely.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I guess if you live in a town so small that once you’ve walked around it for an hour there’s nothing more to see, the sight of somebody eating some tempura seems like a big deal, right up there with the War with Russia, just because people don’t have anything better to talk about.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Absolutely pathetic!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Considering the way they’ve been brought up, it’s no wonder they turn into such small-minded twerps, depressingly stunted like bonsai maple trees in their little pots.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If it was all just for fun I’d be laughing right along with them, but this was too nasty to be treated as innocent kid stuff.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
First I erased the board without saying a word.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Then I turned to the class and asked them if they really thought this kind of stunt was funny.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was a downright despicable prank – if that word meant anything to them.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At that point one of the kids stood up and said ‘Isn’t it despicable when you get mad just because somebody is laughing at you, na moshi?’ What a bunch of losers they were!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I thought to myself that I had come all the way from Tokyo just to teach the likes of them, I felt disgusted.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I warned them not to try any back talk and to get to work, and finally I got the lesson under way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In the next class, the blackboard said EATING TEMPURA MAKES A MAN TOUCHY.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Things were really getting out of hand now.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I was so furious that I announced that I refused to teach such an impudent crew and sailed right out of the room.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The students, I was told later, were thrilled to have the class canceled.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At this rate, I thought, I’d rather put up with the antiques than with that school.By the time I had gone home and had a good night’s sleep, I wasn’t feeling so worked up about the incident any more.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The students were all sitting in their places that morning as if nothing had happened.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It just didn’t make sense.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Everything went smoothly enough for the next three days, but on the evening of the fourth day I went and had some dumplings in a place called Sumida.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This was a hot-spring area, about ten minutes from town by train or thirty minutes on foot.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Along with the inns, restaurants, and a park, there was also a red-light district there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had heard about a shop at the edge of the red-light district that served very good dumplings, so on my way back from the bathhouse I decided to stop in and give them a try.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This time there were no students around so I figured that nobody would hear about it, but when I went into my first class the next morning, there on the board was TWO PLATES OF DUMPLINGS, SEVEN SEN.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In fact, I did have two plates and I did pay seven sen. What a pain these kids were!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The second class, I was sure, would come up with something too, and so it did: DUMPLINGS IN THE RED-LIGHT DISTRICT – YUM YUM!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was simply beyond belief.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That was the end of the dumplings, but before I knew it they’d found something else: my red towel.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This one was really stupid.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I had gotten into the habit of going for a daily bath in the hot spring at Sumida.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Unlike everything else around there, which wasn’t even close to measuring up to what we had in Tokyo, this place was really first class.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I figured that since it was so close by I might as well treat myself to a bath there every day, so before my dinner I would take a walk out to Sumida, which gave me some exercise into the bargain.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
On these walks I always carried a big bath towel.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now this towel took on a reddish tint from the water, and the dye from its red stripes began to run as well, so from a distance you might think it was solid red.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Coming and going, on foot or by train, I always had that towel in my hand – and so, I heard, the students had taken to calling me Red Towel.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Living in a little town where everybody knows everybody’s business is no fun!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
And that wasn’t all.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The baths were in a newly built three-story building.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you went in the First Class Bath they gave you a cotton bathrobe and an attendant would scrub your back for you, all for eight sen, and a girl would serve you a bowl of green tea on an elegant Chinese-style stand.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I always went First Class.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When the kids got wind of this, they spread the word that bathing First Class every day was extravagant for a teacher on a salary of forty yen – as if I needed that kind of advice!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And that wasn’t all, either.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The bath itself was a huge granite-lined tub, about fifteen feet by eighteen.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Usually there would be a dozen or so people soaking in it, but sometimes I had it all to myself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The water was about chest-high, and it felt really nice to get a little exercise by taking a swim in it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I would keep an eye out for moments when the coast was clear, and then I’d have myself a great time splashing around.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But then one day when I hurried down from the third floor to the bath, hoping that I’d be lucky enough to enjoy a good swim, there was a big sign with the warning SWIMMING IN THE BATH STRICTLY PROHIBITED in bold black lettering.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There couldn’t have been many other people who swam in that bath, so they must have put up the sign just for me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I didn’t try to swim any more after that.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But what really surprised me was that the next day at school, there on the board was the message SWIMMING IN THE BATH STRICTLY PROHIBITED.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It seemed as if the whole student body was intent on keeping me under surveillance like a pack of detectives.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was downright depressing.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter what they said about me it wasn’t going to make me stop doing what I wanted to do, but when I wondered what had made me come to such a petty, narrow-minded kind of place I felt completely disgusted.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And then when I went back home I had to put up with the usual trial by antiques again.4Everyone on the staff had to take turns doing night duty at the school – everybody, that is, except for the Badger and Redshirt.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked why these two were excused from this obligation, the answer was that they, unlike the rest of us, were directly appointed to their positions by the Prime Minister.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was ridiculous: they had the biggest salaries and worked the shortest hours, and on top of that they got out of doing night duty – how unfair could you get?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"First they come up with some arbitrary rule, then they go around acting as if it’s only natural.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Of all the nerve!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was really upset about it, but according to the Porcupine no matter how long a list of grievances I came up with I wouldn’t be able to do anything about them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You’d think that as long as they were legitimate you should be able to do something about them, even if you were only a minority of one or two.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Porcupine used an English expression, ‘Might is right,’ to make his point, but I wasn’t sure what the point was supposed to be, so he explained that it meant that the people with the power get their way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That principle I already knew; I hardly needed the Porcupine to deliver a lecture on the subject.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But that was a whole different issue from night duty.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How could anybody respect the ‘power’ of people like the Badger and Redshirt?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway, regardless of this debate, my turn to do night duty came around eventually.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now, being the high-strung type that I am, I just can’t get a good night’s sleep if I don’t sleep in my own bedding.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even when I was a kid, I hardly ever slept over with my friends.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since I could barely stand to sleep at my friends’ places, I felt even worse about spending the night at school.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But no matter how bad I felt, this was part of what they were paying me those forty yen for, so I just had to tough it out.Once the other teachers and the day students had gone home, there was nothing for me to do but sit around by myself, which felt kind of silly.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The night duty room was on the west end of the dormitory building, behind the building where the classrooms were.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The late afternoon sun was pouring in full blast, and from the moment I went in it was so hot I couldn’t stand it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even though the summer was over, the heat took its time out here in the country, just like everything else.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I had one of the dinners they gave the students brought in; I could hardly believe how awful it was.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was amazing that they had the energy to run around the way they did on a diet of that kind of stuff.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What’s more, they made such quick work of it that they were all done by half past four – you really had to take your hat off to them!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was still light out when I finished dinner, so going to bed was obviously out of the question.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Suddenly I got the urge to pay a visit to the hot spring.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I wasn’t sure whether it was all right to leave the premises when you were on night duty, but the idea of sitting around there staring off into space like a prisoner in solitary confinement was more than I could bear.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’d thought it was strange when I had asked for the night duty teacher that first time I came to the school and the custodian had told me that he was out running an errand, but now that it was my turn I could see why.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Better to go.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I told the custodian that I was going out for a little while, and when he asked me if it was on business I said no, I was going to the hot spring, and went on my way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Unfortunately I had left my red towel at home, but I could always rent one at the bathhouse.I took my time and had a nice, leisurely soak.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I finally took the train back to town just as evening was coming on and headed back to school, which was a couple of hundred yards from the station.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just when I was thinking that everything had worked out fine, I noticed the Badger walking down the street toward me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He must have been planning to take the train to the hot spring himself.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He was moving along at a pretty brisk pace, but as we passed each other he realized it was me, so I gave him a quick bow.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Ah, now as far as I can recall, weren’t you supposed to be on duty tonight?’ he asked in an official-sounding tone.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There was no need for him to be coy about it – he knew full well that only two hours earlier he had walked over to me and said ‘Ah, tonight’s your first turn on night duty, isn’t it?’ and thanked me in advance.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It seemed as if expressing yourself in this annoyingly roundabout way was one of the job requirements for being a Principal.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now I was good and angry, so I simply announced ‘Yes, sir, I am on night duty.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And that is why I am on my way to school, which is where, you may be certain, I will be spending the night.’ Then I turned on my heel and walked away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But when I got to the corner at Tatemachi it was the Porcupine’s turn to cross my path.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This really was a small town – all you had to do was head out the door and you’d be sure to run into somebody or other.‘Hey, aren’t you on night duty?’ he asked.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Yeah, I am,’ I said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Well,’ he went on, ‘don’t you think it’s improper for the night duty teacher to go out for a stroll?’ ‘Not at all,’ I said, with a show of dignity.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘In fact, it would be improper not to go out for a stroll.’ ‘You could get yourself into some real trouble with that kind of attitude, you know – especially if you happen to run into the Principal or the Assistant Principal,’ he said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That was hardly the kind of thing I expected to hear from the Porcupine of all people, so this time I let him have it: ‘Well, in fact I just did run into the Principal.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And he said it was a good idea to go out for a walk, because if you didn’t, night duty would be an awful grind when it’s so hot.’ Then, since there was no point in talking about it any further, I turned and walked back to school.It wasn’t long before the sun went down.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After it got dark I invited the custodian into my room for a chat, but after a couple of hours of talking about this and that I’d had enough.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Even though I wasn’t sleepy yet I decided I might as well turn in.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I changed into my sleeping robe, crawled in under the mosquito netting, pushed the red blanket aside, flopped down onto the bedding backside first with an emphatic thud, and lay there on my back.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This is the same way I’ve been getting into bed ever since I was little.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Once when I was living in that boardinghouse in Tokyo the law student who was in the room underneath mine came up to complain about it, saying it was a bad habit.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even though law students are weaklings they do have big mouths, and this one started to deliver a long, nonsensical speech so I shut him up by telling him that if he heard a lot of noise when I went to bed it wasn’t my backside’s fault, it was because the building was so flimsy, and if he had a problem he should take it up with the owners.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since this night duty room wasn’t on the second floor, though, I could make as much noise as I wanted when I dropped onto the bedding and it wouldn’t bother anybody.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I can’t do it with a nice, big crash, I just don’t feel like I’m really going to sleep.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But just as I was stretching out and starting to feel really comfortable, I felt something land on my legs.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Whatever it was had a rough, scratchy feel to it, so I knew it couldn’t be fleas.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Feeling a little rattled, I shouted ‘What the …?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
!’ and tried shaking my legs a couple of times under the blanket.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As soon as I did this, I could feel more of the scratchy things all over me – on five or six places on my shins, two or three on my thighs, one that I squashed with my behind, one that even jumped right up onto my belly button – now I was really rattled!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I bolted straight out of bed, yanked the blanket down, and saw a swarm of fifty or sixty grasshoppers leaping up off the mattress.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Until I realized what was going on the whole thing had felt pretty creepy, but once I figured out what I was dealing with I got really mad.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you think a bunch of grasshoppers is enough to put a scare into somebody, just you get a load of this, I thought, and I grabbed my pillow and started bashing away at them, but they made such small targets that no matter how hard I swung it I didn’t accomplish much.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"For lack of a better strategy, I sat back down on the mattress and began swatting at it wildly in all directions, the way you might do when you’re trying to beat the dust out of a floor mat.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The force of my attack made the startled grasshoppers leap even higher – they were crashing into my shoulders, my head, some even latched onto the tip of my nose.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I couldn’t get rid of the ones that were sticking to my face by whacking them with the pillow, so I picked them off and flung them away as hard as I could.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter how hard I threw the damned things, there was nothing to show for it but a gentle ripple on the mosquito netting when they hit it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
They stayed perched on the netting right where they landed.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
They wouldn’t die; they wouldn’t do anything.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
After about thirty minutes of this I finally managed to get rid of them all.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Then I went and got a broom and started sweeping up all the dead ones.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
At this point the custodian came in and asked what had happened.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘What do you mean, what happened?’ I shouted.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Did you ever hear of a place where people keep grasshoppers in their bed, you idiot?’ ‘I wouldn’t know, sir,’ he answered apologetically.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Is that the best you can say for yourself?’ I said, flinging the broom out onto the veranda.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He beat a hasty retreat with the broom on his shoulder and an embarrassed look on his face.I immediately called for three of the boarding students to come out as representatives of the whole group.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Instead, six of them turned up.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Six, ten, whatever, it didn’t make a bit of difference to me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Still in my night robe, I rolled up my sleeves and began the interrogation.‘Why the devil did you put those grasshoppers in my bed?’‘Uhh, grasshoppers?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What do you mean?’ said the one standing at the front of the group.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This was way too casual.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It wasn’t just the Principal who tried to beat around the bush at this school; the students had the same way of talking.‘You don’t know what a grasshopper is?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, look at this!’ I yelled, but unfortunately they’d all been swept up and there wasn’t one to be seen.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I called the custodian in and ordered him to bring some back, at which point he said ‘I’ve already thrown them in the garbage, would you like me to pull them out?’ ‘Yes, do it right now,’ I said, and he scurried off.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Before long he was back with about a dozen of them piled on a piece of writing paper: ‘So sorry, sir, but what with it being nighttime and all, these were all I could find.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’ll bring some more tomorrow morning.’ What a fool!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I took one of the insects, held it up in front of the students, and said ‘This is a grasshopper – see how big they are?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now, don’t tell me you don’t know what they are!’ ‘No,’ said a moon-faced boy on the left edge of the group, ‘that’s a locust, na moshi.’ The kid had some nerve, but now I was on the spot.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Grasshoppers, locusts, they’re all the same!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
And who do you damned jackasses think you are sticking that stupid na moshi on the end of everything when you’re talking to a teacher?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It just makes you sound mushy – that’s all it’s good for!’ That ought to show them who’s boss, I thought – but they came right back with ‘Na moshi isn’t the same as mushy – na moshi.’ It was hopeless – they couldn’t stop saying na moshi even if they tried.‘Locusts, grasshoppers, whatever – what were you doing putting them in my bed?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
When did I ever tell you to do that?’‘Nobody put them there.’‘Oh yeah?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"So what were they doing there?’‘Well, locusts like warm places, so they must have decided to go in there on their own … ’‘What kind of nonsense is that?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
A bunch of grasshoppers decided to go in there on their own?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Do you think I’m going to stand for this?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just tell me why you pulled a stunt like that – come on!’‘There’s nothing to tell.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How can we tell you anything if we didn’t do it?’How shabby could you get?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you’re not going to own up to what you’ve done, you shouldn’t have done anything in the first place.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They obviously figured that as long as no evidence turned up, all they had to do was play dumb and they’d get away with it – of all the nerve!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Of course, I’d been involved in my share of pranks myself when I was in middle school, but when they asked me whether I was the one who did it, I would never, ever try to weasel out of it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I did it, I did it, and if I didn’t, I didn’t; that’s all there was to it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter how much mischief I was involved in, I still had my honor.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you’re just going to lie your way out of the punishment afterward, well, you shouldn’t have done anything to begin with.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Mischief and punishment go hand in hand – it’s knowing that the punishment comes with it that makes it fun to dare to do the mischief.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Did they really think that there was some low-down country out there where people could play tricks and then claim immunity from the consequences?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This must be the way that those characters who borrow money off you and then refuse to pay it back get their start in life, too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just what were these kids doing in a middle school anyway?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If they thought that getting an education is about learning to lie and fake and play mean tricks when nobody’s looking, and then parading around proudly when you graduate, they still had a lot to learn.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What riffraff!Getting into a debate with a bunch of kids who had such a rotten attitude made me feel sick to my stomach, so I just said ‘All right, never mind.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you’re in middle school and you still don’t know anything about what it means to have some class, you’re pathetic,’ and sent all six of them back to bed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There may be nothing very classy about the way I talk or the way I look, but I think I can say that when it comes to heart the quality is there, which is a lot more than you could say for them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The six of them drifted away, looking so cool and composed that if you were only judging by appearances, you could say that they cut much finer figures than I, their teacher, did.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But in fact their attitude just showed all the more clearly how little class they really had.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I could never pull off anything like that myself.Finally I was able to stretch out in bed again, but in all the commotion the mosquitoes had made their way inside the netting and now they were buzzing around all over the place.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It would have been way too hard to try to get rid of them by burning them one at a time with my candle, so I took down the netting, folded it lengthwise on the floor, and shook it out from each side.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"While I was doing this, one of the metal fastening rings smacked the back of my hand so hard it made me groan.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Back in bed for the third time, I finally started to calm down a little, but I still couldn’t get to sleep.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The clock said half past ten.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I lay there thinking about what a mess I had gotten myself into by coming here.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If being a middle school teacher meant that you had to put up with kids like these no matter where you went, it was pretty sad.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was a wonder they didn’t run out of teachers.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I guess it’s a job for people who are tremendously patient, and thick-skulled as well.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was certainly more than I could take.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When you think about it, you really have to hand it to somebody like Kiyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She was just an old woman without any education or social standing, but as a human being she was really noble.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even though she’d done so much for me, I’d never felt particularly grateful to her before, but now that I found myself on my own so far away from home I finally realized how kindhearted she’d been.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If she wanted some of those sweets from Echigo, it would certainly be worth making a trip there just to get some for her.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She used to praise me for having an unselfish, upstanding character, but if anybody was going to be praised for being a truly fine person, she deserved it a lot more than I did.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"How I longed to see her then!As I lay there tossing and turning with these thoughts of Kiyo running through my mind, all of a sudden I heard the sound of what must have been thirty or forty pairs of feet pounding steadily on the wooden floor directly above my head, so hard that it seemed like the ceiling might come crashing down on me any minute.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Then they started yelling at a volume that matched the stamping.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I bolted out of bed again, wondering what could possibly be going on.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As soon as I was up I realized it had to be the students, trying to get back at me … You guys, I thought to myself … Until you acknowledge that what you did was wrong, you’re still guilty in my eyes.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
You must have realized it was wrong.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The decent thing to do would be to go back to your beds and think it over and, once you’ve had some second thoughts, come and apologize in the morning.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Or even if you couldn’t bring yourselves to do that, the least you could do would be to feel a little ashamed of yourselves and go to sleep quietly.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
And instead you go in for more mayhem?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Don’t you know that this is supposed to be a dormitory, not a pigpen?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
You’d better cut back on these crazy stunts.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just you wait … I dashed out of my room, still in my night robe, and bounded up the stairway to the second floor.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"To my amazement the racket that had been erupting just above my head had suddenly turned into absolute silence; not a hint of those screaming voices, let alone pounding feet.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Very strange!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The lamps were already out so it was too dark to see anything clearly, but I could sense that some of them were lurking here and there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But there was nobody, not even a mouse, in the hallway that ran the length of the dormitory from east to west.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Down at the far end there was a bright patch where the moon was shining in.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Definitely strange, like the times years ago when I used to have all kinds of dreams and then wake up with a jolt and start babbling a stream of nonsense.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I used to get laughed at a lot for that.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Once when I was sixteen or seventeen I even had this dream about finding a diamond and I sprang out of bed and furiously asked my brother, who was lying next to me, where my diamond was.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The whole household wouldn’t stop laughing at me for three days, which was very hard to take.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"For all I knew, what was happening now might be a dream, too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But I had heard them carrying on …As I stood there sunk in my thoughts, the silence was suddenly shattered by dozens of voices screaming ‘One, two, three … YAAAAAHHH!!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"!’ from down at the end of the corridor where the moon was shining in so brightly, followed in no time by the same rhythmic stomping of feet on the wooden floor that I’d heard before.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
So it hadn’t been a dream after all.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘QUIET!!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It’s the middle of the night!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"!’ I roared in a voice loud enough to make myself heard over the racket, and I started to run down toward the far end of the hallway.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since it was dark all around me, all I could do was head for that patch of moonlight at the end.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had only gone a couple of yards when my shins banged into something hard right in the middle of the corridor, and before I could even hear myself yelling ‘OW!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
!’ I was dropping to the floor with a resounding crash.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Damn them, I thought as I pulled myself back up, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t run any more; my leg just refused to do what it was told.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Seething, I hopped down to the end on my good foot, but by then the stomping and the shouting had turned to silence again and everything was still.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter how low human beings sink, it’s not possible for them to sink this low.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
These kids really were more like pigs than humans.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If this is the way they want it, I decided, I wasn’t going to leave until I had dragged them out of their hiding places and made them apologize, no matter how long it took, but when I tried to push open the door to get into one of their rooms it wouldn’t budge.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I couldn’t tell whether they had locked it or shoved some desks or other furniture against it; either way, I couldn’t get it to open however hard I pushed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I tried the door across the corridor.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It didn’t budge any more than the first one did.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"While I furiously kept trying to push my way into the room and grab one of the kids, the jeering and stomping started up all over again at the other end of the hallway.Finally I realized what was going on: the little devils had it all planned out so they could give it to me from both sides.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But what could I do about it?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’ll have to admit it: I may have courage, but I don’t have the brains to match.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I get myself into this kind of fix, I’m totally at a loss.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But even if I’m at a loss, I’ll be damned if I’m going to be a loser.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
To give up at this point would have been a disgrace.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It would have been awful to let them have an excuse for claiming that Tokyo people have no guts.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If people were to hear that I allowed this pack of snot-nosed brats to make a fool out of me while I was on duty and simply slunk back to my room because I couldn’t handle them, I would never live it down.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Whatever faults I may have, my ancestors were retainers of the Shogun, a line of warriors going back to the Emperor Seiwa and descended from the great Minamoto no Mitsunaka.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’m not made of the same stuff as those peasants were, of that you can be sure.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
If only I could think of something!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
If only there was some way out of this mess!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyhow, I wasn’t about to give in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Being honest, I couldn’t see a way out.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But after all, if you can’t win with honesty, what else is there?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All right, I decided, if I couldn’t win tonight, I’d win tomorrow.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I couldn’t win tomorrow, I’d win the day after.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And if I couldn’t win the day after, I’d just have my meals delivered from home and stay right where I was until I did win.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I sat myself down right in the middle of the corridor, ready to wait there until the morning.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The mosquitoes were buzzing all around me, but I didn’t care.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I rubbed the spot on my shin I had banged before, I could feel something wet and sticky.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It must have been bleeding.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Fine, let it bleed if it wanted to.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Finally fatigue started to catch up with me and I fell asleep.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But then my sleep was broken off by some kind of commotion, and I pulled myself up with a curse.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The door to my right was half open, and two boys were standing there in front of me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
As soon as I’d come to my senses I grabbed one of the legs of the kid closest to me and jerked it toward me as hard as I could.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He came crashing down flat on his back.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That’ll show you!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then I jumped the other one, who was still just standing there in a kind of daze, grabbed him by the shoulders, and gave him a good shaking up.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He was so stunned that all he could do was keep standing there and blinking his eyes.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I said ‘All right, you two, come with me,’ and bundled them off to my room, they both came along meekly, like the sissies I took them for.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"By this time morning had already broken.When we got back to the night duty room I began my interrogation, but no matter how hard you beat it a pig is still a pig, and the only thing I could get out of them was ‘Uhh, I don’t know’; they weren’t about to confess to anything.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
By and by the rest of the students started coming downstairs in ones and twos and gathering in front of my room.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They all looked sleepy, with puffy eyes.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Shabbier than ever!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How could you call yourself a man if you ended up with a face like that after nothing worse than losing a night’s sleep?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I told them to go get their faces washed and then we would talk, but none of them left.After I had spent the better part of an hour going back and forth with all fifty-something of them and getting nowhere, the Badger suddenly turned up.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I found out later, the custodian had gone to his house to report that there was some kind of commotion going on at school.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The fact that he would go to the bother of calling on the Principal over an incident like this just shows what a faint-hearted type he was.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No wonder he ended up as a school custodian!I gave the Principal a general account of what had happened, and then he listened to a little of what the students had to say for themselves.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He announced that he would take appropriate measures later, but meanwhile they should continue with their studies as usual.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then, after telling them to hurry up and get washed and have their breakfast because they’d be late for class if they didn’t get moving, he let them all go.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This was being much too easy on them.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If it had been up to me, I would have expelled them all on the spot.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If they were going to be treated so leniently, why shouldn’t they harass a night duty teacher?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Next the Principal turned to me and said that since I must be quite worn out from the strain, I would be excused from offering instruction today, to which I replied ‘No, sir, it was no strain at all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even if this were to happen every night, I would never feel any strain over it for as long as I live.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I will teach my classes.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I was ever unable to teach simply because of losing a night’s sleep, I’d return that portion of my salary to the school.’ The Principal just gazed at me for a couple of moments with an inscrutable expression; then he said ‘But your face looks quite swollen, you know.’ It was true, it did feel kind of heavy and a little numb.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was itching all over, too; the mosquitoes must have really worked it over.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘No matter how swollen my face is, my mouth is still working fine,’ I said, scratching away at it all the while.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘There won’t be any problems with today’s classes.’ ‘Quite a sturdy fellow, aren’t you?’ he said with a laugh.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This wasn’t really supposed to be a compliment, I think; it sounded kind of snide.5‘How would you like to do a little fishing?’ Redshirt asked me.His tone of voice was so gentle that it made you feel creepy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
You could hardly tell whether it was a man’s voice or a woman’s.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you’re a man, you should talk like one – all the more so if you’re a university graduate.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If somebody like me, who only went to the Institute of Physical Sciences, can have the kind of voice I do, it was really a disgrace for a man with a university degree to talk the way he did.‘Well, I guess so,’ I answered, without very much enthusiasm, at which point he was rude enough to ask me if I had ever gone fishing before.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It’s true that I haven’t done much, but I did catch three silver carp once when I was a kid at a fishing hole in Komume.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I also hooked an eight-inch carp once at the Bishamon festival in Kagurazaka, but when I tried to pull it out it dropped back into the water with a big splash; it still bothers me to think that I let it get away like that.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I told all this to Redshirt, he just stuck out his chin and laughed that effeminate laugh of his.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I didn’t see what was so funny.‘Well, then, you haven’t experienced the joys of fishing yet, have you?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’d be glad to initiate you if you like,’ he said in an extremely smug tone.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Who did he think would want his initiation?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"To begin with, fishermen and hunters are downright inhumane in my opinion.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If they weren’t, there’s no way that they’d get any pleasure out of killing living things.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Anybody can see that a fish or a bird would rather be alive than be killed.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you have to fish or hunt in order to make your living that’s a different story, but if you’re not lacking for anything and you still can’t get to sleep at night unless you’ve gone out and killed some living creature, that’s going too far.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"These were the thoughts that were running through my head, but of course I don’t have the way with words a university man does, so instead of getting into a debate with him I just kept them all to myself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He must have thought that he had won me over by now, and kept right after me, saying ‘Let’s start the initiation right away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"How about going out today, if you’ve got the time?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It’ll be more fun that way for Yoshikawa and me too, so please come along.’Yoshikawa was the art teacher, the one I’d given the nickname the Hanger-on.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"For some reason he was always hanging around at Redshirt’s place, and he’d tag along after Redshirt wherever he went, as if he were some kind of personal attendant instead of a colleague.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I knew that if Redshirt was going somewhere the Hanger-on was bound to be there too, so it wasn’t any surprise that they were going fishing together, but why did they have to invite an unsociable guy like me along instead of just enjoying it by themselves?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I guessed that they must have wanted to show off this elegant pastime of theirs.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
As if I was the type to be impressed!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even if they managed to land a couple of tuna somehow, did they really think I would give a damn?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway, beginner or not, I was just as much of a man as they were, so I’d probably manage to catch something.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And besides, knowing Redshirt, he’d probably think that if I didn’t go it must be because I’m a lousy fisherman, not because I wasn’t interested.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"So, finally, I told him I’d go.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After school, I went home and got ready, then I went to the station to meet the other two, and we headed down to the harbor.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There was just one boatman, with a long, narrow boat that didn’t look like any I’d ever seen in the waters around Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There were no fishing poles in sight.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had no idea how we were supposed to catch fish without a pole, but when I asked the Hanger about it he simply stroked his chin and explained, as if he was some kind of expert, that you don’t use a pole to fish offshore, you just use a line.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If this was the kind of put-down I was going to get, I would have been better off just keeping my mouth shut.The boatman kept plying his oar in the same slow, easy rhythm, but there’s nothing like a professional: by the time I glanced back at the harbor, we were already so far out that it was starting to look pretty small.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The slender pagoda of Kōhaku Temple rose up out of a grove of trees like a needle.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
On the other side of the boat we could see Green Island floating on the water.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This island, I was told, was uninhabited.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
When you looked closely you could see that it was nothing but boulders and pine trees – no wonder nobody lived there.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Redshirt surveyed the scene intently and announced that it was quite beautiful.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The Hanger agreed that it was absolutely superb.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I wasn’t sure how superb it was, but I was certainly feeling pretty good.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just being out on that broad expanse of water with a cool sea breeze blowing would be a pleasure for anybody.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was getting really hungry.‘Now look at that pine tree – the one with the straight trunk and the top opening out like an umbrella – it’s like something out of a Turner painting,’ Redshirt said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Yes, yes, just like a Turner – look at the way it curves, it’s just right – it has to be a Turner,’ said the Hanger, looking pleased with himself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had no idea what a Turner was, but it didn’t seem to be worth asking about, so I just kept quiet.The boat swung around to the left of the island.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There wasn’t a wave to be seen.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was so calm that you would hardly even think you were out on the sea.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Thanks to Redshirt, I was really enjoying myself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was thinking that we should try putting in at the island, but when I asked them if we could land by one of the rocks, Redshirt said it wasn’t impossible but the fishing wouldn’t be good if we went in too close.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I didn’t reply.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then the Hanger broke in with a totally inane question: ‘What do you think, sir, from now on shouldn’t we call it Turner Island?’ Redshirt agreed that it was a fine idea.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Count me out, I thought to myself; Green Island was just fine with me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Hanger’s next suggestion was that it would make a good picture if we could set Raphael’s Madonna up on that rock, but this time Redshirt’s answer was ‘Let’s not talk about Madonnas,’ with one of those mild-mannered, creepy laughs of his.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He looked distinctly uncomfortable.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Hanger said there was nothing to worry about since there was nobody around to overhear, but then he glanced over in my direction and lowered his gaze with a silly smirk.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I was beginning to feel a little on edge myself.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Madonnas, prima donnas, whatever – it didn’t have anything to do with me, so they could stick anybody they wanted up there as far as I was concerned.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But talking about things that other people don’t understand, and acting like it doesn’t matter if they overhear you precisely because they won’t understand, is downright tacky.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
And to think that the Hanger called himself a native Tokyo man!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I figured that this Madonna they were talking about must be their nickname for some geisha that Redshirt was seeing.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If he wanted to stand his favorite geisha under a pine tree on a deserted island and enjoy the scene, that was okay with me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And if the Hanger wanted to paint her portrait in oils and show it at an exhibition somewhere, well, let him!The boatman said that we were at a good spot and threw the anchor overboard.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When Redshirt asked how deep the water was, he said about six fathoms.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Redshirt said that it was pretty hard to fathom how we were going to find any bream at that depth and flung his line into the water.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"So the big boss was after a bream, was he?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Very intrepid!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But the Hanger said that Redshirt, being the expert fisherman that he was, was sure to land one, especially with the water being so calm, and accompanied this bit of flattery with a cast of his own line.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"To my surprise, the lines only had lead sinkers on the end.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
No floats.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Trying to fish without a float is kind of like trying to take somebody’s temperature without a thermometer.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I couldn’t see any point to it, but Redshirt said ‘Come on now, try it yourself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Have you got a line?’ I told him that I had plenty of line but no float, to which he replied that floats were only for amateurs.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When your line hits bottom, he explained, you just hold it down against the gunwale with your index finger and feel for a tug, like this – look, there’s one now!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Redshirt started reeling in his line right away, as if he was sure he had caught something, but all he came up with was a bare hook with the bait gone.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Served him right!‘Ah, what a shame!’ said the Hanger.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘It certainly must have been a big one.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now, if it was able to get away from an expert like you, sir, we’ll all really have to be on our toes today.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But even so, it still beats sitting there just staring at your float like the beginners do, doesn’t it?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Why, they’re no better than those people who can’t ride a bicycle without brakes.’ Listening to him spout this nonsense, I was just itching to treat him to a good beating.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I mean, I’m a man, too, and it wasn’t as if the Assistant Principal had rented out the entire sea for his own personal use – it was big enough for all of us!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Thinking that a nice juicy bonito really ought to come along and at least take a nibble at my line, if only as a matter of principle, I threw it into the water with a satisfying splash and wiggled it lazily with my fingertip.By and by, I began to feel something pulling on the line.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It had to be a fish, I thought to myself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Anything that could tug that hard would have to be alive.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Gotcha!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I started hauling it in as fast as I could.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Oh my, did you catch something?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"A classic case of beginner’s luck,’ said the Hanger in a mocking tone.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I had pulled my line almost all the way back in; there were only a couple of feet left in the water.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Peering over the side, I saw that what I had hooked was a striped fish that looked something like a goldfish.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was lunging this way and that as I hauled it up.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Now this was fun!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I pulled it to the surface, it broke the water with splash, drenching my face into the bargain.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Finally I managed to grab the thing and tried to take the hook out of its mouth, but this turned out to be no easy trick.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It felt all slimy in my hand – yuck!!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I just gave up and flung it down onto the floor of the boat, line and all, and it died almost immediately.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Redshirt and the Hanger were watching all this with amazement.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I scrubbed my hands with some seawater and took a sniff.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
They still had a fishy smell.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had learned my lesson: no matter what I caught, I wanted no part of holding it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The fish probably didn’t want any part of it either.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I wound up my line right away.‘Well, good for you, you’ve scored the first point, but it’s only a goruki,’ said the Hanger, playing the smart aleck again, at which point Redshirt cracked a joke: ‘Goruki?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Sounds like he’s hooked a Russian novelist.’ Of course the Hanger had to chime in right away: ‘Oh yes!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Gorky, the Russian novelist.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Very good!’ All right, so a goruki is a Russian novelist, Maruki is a photographer’s studio back in Tokyo, and a door key gets you into your house.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Redshirt just loved dropping foreign names, making it sound like he was pronouncing them in some foreign alphabet, no matter who he was talking to.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
A totally obnoxious habit.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Everyone has their own field of knowledge.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How was a math teacher like me supposed to know the difference between Gorky and Porky?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Better to give it up.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If he was going to throw around this foreign stuff at all, he should have stuck with things that even people like me have heard of, like Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Sometimes he would bring this magazine with a bright red cover called Imperial Literature to school with him and read it as if it was the greatest thing around.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked the Porcupine about it, he told me that that was where he got all those foreign names of his.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As far as I was concerned, that magazine was his partner in crime!Redshirt and the Hanger kept fishing away, and in the space of about an hour they managed to land fifteen or sixteen fish between them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The funny thing was, every last one of the fish they caught was a goruki.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There wasn’t even the slightest hint of a bream.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘It’s a good day for Russian literature,’ Redshirt said to the Hanger, who replied that if goruki were what an expert like Redshirt was catching, someone like himself certainly couldn’t hope for anything else.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"According to the boatman, these fish are full of bones and have an awful taste, definitely not fit for eating; you could use them for fertilizer, though.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"So Redshirt and the Hanger had been busy fishing for fertilizer, then.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was absolutely pathetic.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"My one catch had been more than enough for me, and since then I had been lying on my back in the bottom of the boat and gazing up at the sky.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This was a much more elegant pastime than fishing.Before long the two of them began talking to each other about something in a hushed tone.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I couldn’t hear them very well, and didn’t want to.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
As I gazed at the sky I was thinking about Kiyo.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I was thinking how nice it would be if I had some money and I could bring her here to enjoy this pretty place.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter how splendid the scenery was, it was no fun being here with the likes of the Hanger.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Kiyo might be a wrinkled old woman, but I wouldn’t feel embarrassed to take her anywhere.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"People like the Hanger weren’t worth associating with no matter where you were – in a carriage, on a boat, even at the top of the twelve-story tower in Asakusa Park back in Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was sure that if I were the Assistant Principal and Redshirt were in my position, I’d be the one this guy was buttering up and flattering all over the place, and Redshirt would be the one he was always sneering at.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They say that Tokyo people are two-faced, and now I was beginning to see why: if a guy like the Hanger was going around the country telling everybody about how he was a true son of Tokyo at every chance he got, it’s no wonder that country people thought that ‘two-faced’ was just another way of calling somebody a Tokyoite, and vice versa.As these thoughts were passing through my head, I could hear the two of them breaking into a kind of muffled giggle.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In between the laughs they were saying something to each other, but I could only make out bits and pieces of it and couldn’t catch the drift: ‘What?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Do you mean to say that … ’ ‘ … It’s awful … had absolutely no idea … such a disgrace … ’ ‘How could?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"… ’ ‘Yes, grasshoppers … it’s the truth … ’I wasn’t listening to any of this very carefully, but when I heard the word ‘grasshoppers’ coming out of the Hanger’s mouth it jolted me to attention.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"For some reason he had put particular emphasis on it, as if to make sure that I would hear it loud and clear, but then he deliberately went back to that muffled tone.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I kept still and went on listening.‘That Hotta’s at it again … ’ ‘Hmm, maybe so … ’ ‘Tempura … hahahahaha … ’ ‘ … and incited … ’ ‘ … and dumplings, too?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"… ’These bits and pieces were all that I could catch, but judging from the words that I was able to make out – ‘grasshoppers,’ ‘tempura,’ ‘dumplings’ – they could only have been having a confidential talk about me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If they wanted to have a talk, they should have done it in a regular voice; if they had something confidential to discuss, well, they shouldn’t have invited me along.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What a pair of creeps!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Grasshoppers, glass choppers, whatever it was, it hadn’t been any fault of mine.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That badger of a Principal had said that he would deal with the incident himself, so I was just going along and staying out of things for now.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just who did the Hanger think he was, sticking in his own totally uncalled-for comments like this?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He should have stuck to sucking on his brushes and kept out of it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway I knew that I would get around to settling my own accounts sooner or later, so I didn’t care what they were saying about me, but things like ‘That Hotta again’ and ‘incited’ did make me feel uneasy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Did they mean that the Porcupine had incited me to turn the incident into a big brouhaha?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Or that he had incited the students to go after me?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I couldn’t figure out what they were getting at.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I kept gazing up into the blue, the sunlight was getting fainter and fainter, and a slightly chilly breeze was starting to blow.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just as the clouds, which had been as wispy as the smoke from an incense burner, looked like they had quietly risen all the way up into the clear depths of the heavens, I realized that they were condensing into a faint mist.‘Well, shall we head back?’ Redshirt asked, as if he’d just thought of something.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Hanger said yes, it’s the perfect time, isn’t it, and then asked Redshirt if he was planning to pay a call on Mademoiselle Madonna that evening.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Redshirt, who had been leaning casually against the side of the boat, said ‘Don’t say anything foolish, there could be trouble, you know,’ and pulled himself up a little.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Hee hee, don’t worry,’ the Hanger replied, ‘even if he did hear … ’ When he quickly turned to look at me, I gave him my best if-looks-could-kill glare, my eyes as big as saucers.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Uh-oh, that’s too much for me!’ he murmured, looking for all the world as if he was blinded by my gaze, and scratched his head as he tried to pull it in between his hunched-up shoulders.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What a charlatan!The boatman rowed us back across the still waters to the shoreline.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
When Redshirt said that it looked like I hadn’t enjoyed the fishing very much I agreed that I much preferred lying back and looking up at the sky.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I threw what was left of my cigarette overboard; it hit the water with a hiss and then bobbed up and down as it drifted on the current of the boatman’s oar.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then, suddenly, he changed the subject completely: ‘The students are so glad that you’re here.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"We’re counting on you to give it your best effort.’‘They don’t look very glad to me.’‘No, no, I’m not just saying this to make you feel good.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
They really are glad.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Aren’t they, Yoshikawa?’‘They’re more than glad, they’re in an absolute frenzy,’ said the Hanger with that insinuating grin of his.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was amazing the way every single thing he said got on my nerves somehow.‘But,’ Redshirt added, ‘if you aren’t careful, you could get yourself into some real trouble.’‘I know it’s out there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Whatever happens, I’ll be ready for it.’ In fact I was determined that I’d either get an apology from all the boarding students or get fired, one or the other.‘Well, if that’s the way you feel about it there isn’t much more I can say … But I’m telling you this because as the Assistant Principal I only want what’s best for you, and I hope you won’t take it the wrong way.’‘That’s right,’ the Hanger chimed in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘The Assistant Principal is completely on your side.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And since you and I are both from Tokyo, I’m hoping that the two of us will be able to stick together for a good, long time.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In my own little way I’m doing what I can on your behalf behind the scenes, you know.’ For once, he was actually sounding like a regular guy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But I’d rather hang myself than feel beholden to the likes of him!‘Yes, the students are really happy that you’ve come to our school.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But all the same, there are various circumstances that have to be taken into consideration.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I know there may be times when you’re going to get upset, but I hope that you’ll just grin and bear it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And for my part, I’ll never do anything that would end up hurting you.’‘“Various circumstances”?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What do you mean?’‘Well, it’s all a bit complicated, but you’ll see it clearly enough for yourself by and by.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even without my explaining it, it will all become clear in due course.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Won’t it now, Yoshikawa?’‘Yes, yes, it is quite complicated, not the kind of thing that you can expect to understand overnight.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But you’ll see clearly enough for yourself by and by.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even without my explaining it, it will all become clear in due course.’ These were virtually the same words that Redshirt had just used.‘Well, if it’s that much of a bother I don’t really need to hear about it, but since you were the one who mentioned it, I just thought I’d ask.’‘True enough.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was the one who brought it up, so it was a little irresponsible of me not to follow through.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All right, then, let me just say this: pardon me for putting it this way, but you’ve only just received your diploma, and this is your first experience as a teacher.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But there are all sorts of complicated personal considerations to take into account in a school, and it won’t do to approach things as straightforwardly as you did when you were a student … ’‘If it won’t do to approach things straightforwardly, then what will?’‘Now, that’s just what I’m trying to say: an inexperienced young man who speaks his mind the way you do still has a lot to learn … ’‘Of course I’m inexperienced.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’m only twenty-two years and four months old, just like it says on my papers.’‘And that’s why it would be so easy for someone to take advantage of you in ways you’ve never even dreamed of.’‘No matter what anybody tries to do to me, I won’t have anything to be afraid of as long as I’m honest.’‘Of course you won’t.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Nothing to be afraid of – but they’ll still take advantage of you.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In fact, your own predecessor got taken in, and that’s why I’m warning you to be on your guard.’Suddenly I noticed that the Hanger had been keeping very quiet during all this.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I looked around and saw that he had moved back to the stern of the boat and was talking fishing with the boatman.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was much easier for me to talk to Redshirt without him around.‘Who was it that took advantage of my predecessor?’‘I can’t tell you who; we have to think about his reputation.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Besides, we don’t have all the evidence yet, so it wouldn’t be right to reveal it now.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At any rate, now that you’re finally here, all of the work we put into bringing you here would go for nothing if something were to happen.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Please be careful.’‘Yes, but I don’t know how I can be any more careful than I am now.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As long as I don’t do anything wrong myself I’ll be all right, won’t I?’Redshirt just laughed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I hadn’t noticed that there was anything particularly funny about what I’d said.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Right up to that point I’d always firmly believed that this was the way things should be.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now that I thought about it, though, I realized that most people actually encourage you to turn bad.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They seem to think that if you don’t, you’ll never get anywhere in the world.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And then on those rare occasions when they encounter somebody who’s honest and pure-hearted, they look down on him and say he’s nothing but a kid, a Botchan.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If that’s the way it is, it would be better if they didn’t have those ethics classes in elementary school and middle school where the teacher is always telling you to be honest and not to lie.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The schools might as well just go ahead and teach you how to tell lies, how to mistrust everybody, and how to take advantage of people.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Wouldn’t their students, and the world at large, be better off that way?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Redshirt had laughed at me for being simpleminded.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If people are going to get laughed at for being simpleminded and sincere, there’s no hope.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Kiyo never laughed at me for saying anything like what I said to Redshirt.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She would have been deeply impressed by it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Compared to Redshirt, she’s far and away the superior person.‘Of course you’ll be all right if you don’t do anything wrong, but even if you don’t do anything wrong yourself, you could get into some serious trouble if you don’t realize how wrong other people can be.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You may meet some people who seem nice and easygoing, or who seem to be totally aboveboard, or who even go out of their way to help you find a place to live, but I’d keep a pretty close eye on them if I were you … Hmm, getting a bit chilly, isn’t it?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, it must be autumn, there’s that sepia tint in the mist along the shore.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What a view!’ Now Redshirt turned toward the Hanger and shouted ‘Hey, Yoshikawa!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"How about that view of the shore – really something, isn’t it?’ ‘Yes indeed, absolutely splendid.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
If there was time I could have done a sketch.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What a shame!’ the Hanger replied, not missing the chance to play up to Redshirt yet again.Just as a lamp was being lit on the second floor of the harbor inn and a train whistle came pealing through the air, the prow of our boat slid up onto the sand and came to a stop.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The proprietress of the inn, standing on the shore, welcomed Redshirt back.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I leapt over the side of the boat onto the beach, letting loose with a loud yell as I did so.6I couldn’t stand the Hanger-on.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If somebody tied him to a nice big rock and dumped him in the ocean, they’d be doing Japan a favor.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The sound of Redshirt’s voice made me sick.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He could only get it to sound so smooth by using that stuck-up tone instead of his natural voice.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter how stuck-up he sounded, though, it could never work with a face like that.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If anybody was going to fall for it, it could only be somebody like the Madonna.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway, since he was the Assistant Principal, it was no wonder that what he said was harder to figure out than what the Hanger said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After I went home and did some thinking about what he’d told me, I came to the conclusion that there might well have been something to it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since he didn’t spell everything out clearly, I couldn’t be completely sure that I understood what he was getting at, but basically the point seemed to be that the Porcupine was a bad guy and that I had better watch out for him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If that was it, though, he should have come right out and said so like a real man.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And if the Porcupine was really such a bad teacher, he ought to just go ahead and fire the guy right away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
For somebody who had a university degree the Assistant Principal was surprisingly fainthearted.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He had to be a real weakling if he couldn’t even bring himself to name names when he was talking behind people’s backs.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Weaklings are usually kindhearted people, so you might expect Redshirt to be kind too, in that womanish way of his.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Kindness is one thing and a voice is another, so it would have been wrong not to take his kindness for what it was just because I didn’t care for his voice.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Still, the world is a strange place when you think about it: a guy who rubs you the wrong way treats you kindly while a friend, somebody you get along with fine, turns out to be a scoundrel; it all seems like some kind of farce.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This being the country, I figured, everything must be the opposite of what it was in Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You’ve got to watch out in a place like this – for all I knew fire might suddenly turn to ice out here, or the rocks might turn into lumps of tofu.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But even so, the Porcupine stirring up the students against me?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He hardly seemed to be the type for that kind of mischief … but then again … He was supposed to be the most popular teacher, so maybe he would be able to get away with just about anything he wanted, and yet … In the first place, if he were to just come after me in person and pick a fight, it certainly would have been a lot less trouble than taking such a roundabout approach.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You would think that if he had some kind of problem with me, all he had to do was come and tell me what it was and demand that I resign.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
You can always work these things out if you talk them over.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If it turned out that he was right, I’d be ready to hand in my resignation as of the following day.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It wasn’t as if this was the only job in the world.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter where I ended up, I was sure I’d manage to keep from starving.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This Porcupine, I thought, could have used a little more sense.The Porcupine had been the first to treat me to a dish of shaved ice after I got here.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But to let myself be treated to anything by such a two-faced guy, even just a dish of ice, would be a disgrace.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All I had was one helping, so it only cost him one and a half sen.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But to be beholden to such a phony, even just a sen’s or even a half sen’s worth, would make me feel awful for the rest of my life.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Tomorrow, I decided, I’d return the money as soon as I got to school.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now, there were also those three yen I had borrowed from Kiyo five years ago, which I had never paid back.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It wasn’t that I didn’t have the money; I simply hadn’t done it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Nor, of course, did she have any expectation that I’d be paying her back any time either.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And I, for my part, had no intention of repaying her as if it was just some financial transaction between two strangers.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I was to treat it that way, it would seem as if I didn’t really believe in Kiyo’s generosity, as if I was denying the purity of her feelings for me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The reason I hadn’t returned it wasn’t because I was trying to cheat her; it was because I thought of her as part of my own self.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Of course there was a world of difference between Kiyo and the Porcupine, but when somebody treats you to something and you make no effort to decline it, whether it’s a dish of shaved ice, a cup of sweet tea, or whatever, well, it shows the kind of respect and goodwill you have for that person.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The sense of gratitude that you feel in your heart when you accept a favor from someone, which you could easily have avoided by paying your own way, is a form of giving back that goes beyond anything that money could buy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I may not have the kind of title or position that will impress people, but I’m still a free, full-grown human being.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And when such a person finds you worthy of respect, you should consider it something more precious than a fortune in gold.And yet, I felt, here I had let the Porcupine spend that sen and a half on me, and in return I had let him have that thing more precious than a fortune in gold.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He certainly should have felt grateful, but instead he was engaging in underhanded schemes behind my back – it was disgusting!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Tomorrow I’d go and return the money to him, and then neither of us would owe the other a thing.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Once that was settled, I’d be ready to take him on.Having figured that much out, I began to feel drowsy and soon dropped into a deep sleep.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The next day I headed to school earlier than usual in order to carry out my plan and waited for the Porcupine to arrive, but there was no sign of him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Pale Squash arrived; the Chinese classics teacher arrived; the Hanger-on arrived; even by the time Redshirt arrived the Porcupine’s desk was still undisturbed, with just a single stick of chalk reposing on top in its holder.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had the coins stuck in my fist from the time I left home, the same way I would if I were on my way to the bathhouse, ready to hand back to him as soon as he walked in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I finally opened my hand, they were coated with the sweat from my palm.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since he would probably make some kind of comment if I handed them over all greasy with sweat, I laid them on top of my desk, puffed on them until they were dry, and stuck them back in my hand.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At this point Redshirt came over and started to apologize for what had gone on yesterday, saying that it must have been a hard day for me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Not at all, I said; thanks to them, in fact, I had managed to work up a good appetite.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then, resting an elbow on the Porcupine’s desk, he leaned his broad, flat face right up alongside my nose.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just as I was trying to figure out what he was up to, he asked me to keep what he and the Hanger had said yesterday when we were coming back in the boat strictly confidential, and added that he certainly hoped that I hadn’t mentioned it to anyone already.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That feminine voice of his made him sound really nervous.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Of course I hadn’t said anything so far.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But since I was definitely planning to – I still had the money ready, gripped tightly in my hand – I would be in a bind if he tried to keep me from talking.This Redshirt was really something: first he gives me that riddle which was so easy to solve, even if he never came right out and mentioned the Porcupine by name, and now he tells me that there will be trouble if I do figure it out.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Hardly the kind of responsible behavior that you’d expect from an Assistant Principal!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What he should have been doing was to get himself ready to step right into the thick of things, on my side of course, once the blades started flashing in my battle with the Porcupine.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That’s the kind of attitude you would expect from a real Assistant Principal, and that’s the kind of attitude that would have entitled him to wear that red shirt of his.When I told him I hadn’t said a thing to anybody so far but I did intend to have things out with the Porcupine when he arrived, Redshirt looked terribly upset: ‘No.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That would be wrong and it would lead to problems.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As far as Mr Hotta is concerned, I don’t recall saying anything specific to you.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you do something rash now, it will put me in a very difficult position.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I assume that you didn’t join our staff in order to be a troublemaker.’ All I  could offer in reply to this strange bit of gibberish was that of course I realized that it wouldn’t be good for the school if somebody on its payroll started stirring up trouble.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well then, he said, please just keep yesterday’s discussion between us, and don’t mention it to anybody.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
By this point he had broken into a sweat.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All right, I agreed, this won’t be easy for me either, but if it’s going to create such a problem for you, I won’t do it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘So I can count on you, then?’ he asked insistently.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was hard to tell how far beyond skin deep that soft, feminine manner of his went.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If all college graduates were like this, they didn’t amount to much.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He didn’t seem to have the slightest idea how little sense he was making, how illogical he sounded with these requests of his – and yet he still couldn’t bring himself to take me at my word?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If nothing else, I’m a man.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"How could I ever go so low as to turn my back on someone and break a commitment I had made?At this point the two teachers whose desks were on either side of mine arrived, so Redshirt beat a hasty retreat back to his own desk.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Even his way of walking looked like an act: when he moved across the room he would take care to tread so lightly that he didn’t make a sound.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It had never occurred to me before that walking silently might be something to feel proud of; unless you’re training to be a cat burglar, you might as well just do it in the ordinary way!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When the bugle sounded for the first class, there was still no sign of the Porcupine.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since there was nothing else I could do, I simply left the money on my desk and went off to the classroom.The class ended up running a little overtime, so by the time I got back to the faculty room all the other teachers were sitting at their desks and talking.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Porcupine had finally arrived, too; he was only late for work, not absent as I had guessed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As soon as he laid eyes on me, he announced that I was the one who was responsible for making him late, so I should be the one to pay his fine.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I picked the coins up off my desk, put them down on his, and told him that I was paying him back for the shaved ice from the other day.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘What are you talking about?’ he said with a laugh, but when he saw that I meant it he pushed the money back onto my desk and told me to stop playing stupid jokes.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This was one porcupine, I realized, that was going to stand its ground.‘It’s no joke, this is for real.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There’s no reason for me to be treated to any ices by the likes of you, so I’m paying you back.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Why won’t you take it?’‘Well, if some small change means that much to you I’ll take it back, but how come it’s so important to give it back all of a sudden, as if you just thought of it right now?’‘Right now, whenever – back it goes.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I don’t want you doing me any favors, so back it goes.’The Porcupine gave me a cool stare and then a shrug.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I hadn’t given my word to Redshirt I would have exposed his treachery and had it out with him right then and there, but since I was pledged to silence there was nothing I could do.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Here I was turning deep red in the face and he was just shrugging it off – was this any way to behave?‘All right, I’ll take the money.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Now please pack up and get out of that place you’re renting.’‘Just take it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Whether I want to get out of my place or not is my business, not yours.’‘Actually it isn’t.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Yesterday the landlord came to see me and told me that he wants you out, and when he explained why it sounded perfectly reasonable.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But I figured that I’d better go and see for myself, just to make sure, so this morning I stopped by on the way to school and this time he told me everything.’I didn’t have a clue as to what he was talking about.‘How am I supposed to know what he told you?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
And who gave you the right to be the judge?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If there’s a problem, the first thing to do is talk it over.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"How dare you just assume that he must be right and then act so rudely with me?’‘All right, then, I’ll tell you.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Your manners are so awful the two of them don’t know what to do with you.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The lady of the house isn’t there to be your personal servant, you know.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Sticking your feet out and telling her to wipe them for you – it’s simply outrageous!’‘Oh?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And just when did I have her do that?’‘I really don’t know if you did it or not, but anyway they’ve had it with you.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They said they can make ten or fifteen yen any time they want by selling off a hanging scroll, so they don’t need a lodger like you.’‘Those bare-faced liars!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If they’re so damned clever, why did they rent the room out to me in the first place?’‘How should I know?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The point is that they did it, but now they’re fed up with you and they want you out, so out you go!’‘Fine with me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Even if they begged me on their hands and knees I wouldn’t stay there for anything.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But don’t you forget, it’s all your fault for setting me up with those liars to begin with!’‘My fault?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Are you sure it isn’t just that you’re one big pain in the neck?’The Porcupine had just as much of a temper as I did, and he wasn’t about to let me shout him down either.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
By this time everybody in the room was wondering what was going on and they were all watching us with their jaws hanging open.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As far as I was concerned I hadn’t done anything to be ashamed of, so I shot a glance around the whole room as I stood there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The only one who didn’t look stunned was the Hanger-on, who was sitting there with an amused-looking smile.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But as soon as I caught that squinty face of his full on with a menacing scowl that practically asked him if he was looking for trouble too, he meekly wiped off the smile and put on a more serious expression.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He looked a little shaken.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Before long the bugle sounded again, so the Porcupine and I broke off our confrontation and headed to class.In the afternoon, there was a staff meeting to discuss what action to take regarding the disgraceful misconduct of the dormitory students the night before.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was the first time in my life that I’d been to a staff meeting so I had no idea what to expect, but I assumed that everybody would get together, each of the teachers would present his own opinion, and then the Principal would shape them into some kind of appropriate consensus.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This is the way to handle things when you’ve got a problem that’s hard to solve because the issues aren’t clear-cut.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But in a case like this, which anybody in his right mind would consider outrageous, holding a conference is just a waste of time.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter who looked at it, no matter how, there was obviously only one conclusion you could draw.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since it was so clear-cut, the Principal should have just gone ahead and taken action right away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How indecisive could he be?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If this was what it meant to be a Principal, then there really wasn’t that much to it at all, and ‘Principal’ was just another way of saying ‘Weak-kneed sluggard.’The conference was held in a long, narrow room next to the Principal’s office, which usually served as the faculty lunchroom.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There were about twenty black leather chairs around a long table; it reminded me a little of one of those Western-style restaurants in the Kanda area back in Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At the head of the table sat the Principal, with Redshirt seated beside him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Everyone else was free to sit where they wanted, I was told, except that the physical education teacher always humbly took the seat at the foot of the table.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since I didn’t know what to do, I seated myself between the science teacher and the Chinese classics teacher.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Right across from me were the Porcupine and the Hanger-on.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There were no two ways about it: the Hanger’s face had ‘low-grade’ written all over it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Porcupine’s was far more impressive-looking, even if he was my enemy now.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It made me think of a face that I’d seen in a painting at the Yōgen Temple in Kobinata at my father’s funeral.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The priest had explained that it was a picture of a Buddhist guardian god called Idaten.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Porcupine, still furious, was gazing wildly all around the room, his eyes gyrating in their sockets; when they landed on me, I glared right back – if he thought he was going to stare me down with that look, he’d have to think again – and rolled my eyes at him too for good measure.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"My eyes may not be much to look at, but when it comes to size, well, they’re just as big as the next guy’s, big enough, in fact, that Kiyo used to tell me I’d make a fine actor if I ever went on the Kabuki stage.‘Well, it appears that just about everyone is here,’ the Principal began, at which point the school clerk, a man named Kawamura, did a head count.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Somebody was missing.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Short by one,’ he reported, and tried to figure out who it was.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There was nothing to figure out: the Pale Squash wasn’t there.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I don’t know what kind of karmic connection there was between the two of us, but right from the first time I saw the man’s face I hadn’t been able to get it out of my mind.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He was always the first one I noticed when I arrived in the faculty room, and even when I was just walking around somewhere his image would float into my mind’s eye.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I went to the hot spring, I would sometimes find him sitting and soaking in the tub with that pale, puffy face of his.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Whenever I said hello to him he would just mumble something back and bow so meekly that it made me feel sorry for him.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Nobody in the whole school was as mild-mannered as the Pale Squash.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He hardly ever smiled; he hardly ever said any more than he had to, either.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Gentleman’ was a word that I had come across sometimes in books, but I had always thought that even if it existed in the dictionary, there were no examples to be found in real life.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I met the Squash, though, I was so impressed that for the first time in my life I began to believe that maybe it was more than just a word after all.Since the Squash had become such an important figure to me, it’s no wonder that as soon as I walked into the meeting room I had noticed that he wasn’t there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"To tell the truth, I had even been planning to sit next to him, so I had discreetly been on the lookout for him as I came in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Principal said that he would no doubt be turning up soon, opened the purple silk wrapping around a bundle of papers that was sitting on the table in front of him, and then looked over a document that seemed to be a mimeograph.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Redshirt began rubbing his amber pipe with a silk handkerchief.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This was one of his pastimes, just the kind of thing you’d expect from somebody like him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The others were whispering among themselves; the ones who needed something to do with their hands kept themselves busy tracing designs on the tabletop with the eraser ends of their pencils.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Hanger-on made a couple of attempts at striking up a conversation with the Porcupine, but all he got in return was a couple of grunts and ahhs: the Porcupine was obviously more interested in giving me the evil eye.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I, still refusing to be outdone, glared right back.Eventually the long-awaited Squash arrived, looking as pathetic as ever.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He gave the Badger a ceremonious bow and apologized for being late, explaining that he had been unavoidably detained while attending to a certain matter.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Well, then,’ declared the Badger, ‘I hereby call the meeting to order,’ and had Kawamura, the clerk, pass out copies of the mimeograph.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The first item on the agenda was ‘Punishments’; then there was ‘Control of Students,’ followed by two or three other things.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Badger, in the stuffy tone he regularly adopted when presenting himself as the Spirit of Education personified, gave a speech that ran roughly as follows.‘All instances of inappropriate conduct occurring at this school, be they committed by students or by instructors, are manifestations of a lack of virtue on my part.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Whenever such an incident is reported, the sense of shame that I endure compels me to look deep within myself and question my own worthiness as a Principal.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Unfortunately, gentlemen, I must come before you once again to humbly offer my profound apologies on account of yet another such disturbance.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"However, as that which has been done cannot be undone, appropriate measures must now be taken.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since the facts of the matter are already known to you, I hereby request that you assist me by informing me, in a frank and open manner, of your thoughts as to how the situation may best be rectified.’As I listened to these words, I thought to myself with admiration that beings such as Principals and badgers are indeed blessed with silver tongues.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If the Principal was really assuming responsibility for the entire incident, and going so far as to speak of it as his own fault, a manifestation of his own lack of virtue, you would think that it would be better for him to forget about punishing the students and simply turn in his own resignation.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In that case, there wouldn’t have been any need to go to the bother of calling a staff meeting.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
All you needed was to use a little common sense.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was all perfectly clear: I had just been sitting there on night duty, and the students acted up.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It wasn’t my fault, it wasn’t the Principal’s; it was obviously theirs and theirs only.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If the Porcupine had been involved in inciting them, then all you had to do was get rid of him along with the students.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Who ever heard of somebody who makes it his business to cover other people’s butts and then goes around proclaiming that those butts are actually his own?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Nobody but a Badger could pull off that kind of trick.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Having finished spouting these inane remarks, he looked around the room with a self-satisfied air.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Nobody, however, had anything to say.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The science teacher was gazing at a crow that was perched on the roof.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The Chinese classics teacher was busy folding up his mimeographed sheet and then unfolding it again.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The Porcupine was still glaring at me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If all conferences were such a farce, you’d be better off giving them a miss and taking a nap instead.Since the silence was beginning to get to me I decided I would break it with a nice big speech of my own, but just as I was lifting my butt off the chair Redshirt started to say something, so I stopped.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He had put away his pipe, and as he talked he mopped his face with his striped silk handkerchief.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This had to be something he’d managed to wheedle out of the Madonna; a man’s handkerchief ought to be made of white linen.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘I, too,’ he began, ‘felt a sense of my own inadequacy as Assistant Principal when I heard about the misbehavior of the dormitory students, and I am deeply ashamed of my failure to provide proper moral guidance to these young people.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Incidents of this sort are inevitably the result of some kind of shortcoming, and although this one may appear to be the fault of the students if we view it as an isolated episode, when we consider the fuller picture we may well find that in actuality the responsibility lies with the school.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I believe, therefore, that treating what is merely a superficial phenomenon with severely punitive measures might in fact lead to negative consequences in the future.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Furthermore, it is by no means impossible that what we have here is simply a spontaneous overflowing of youthful high spirits, and that the pranks in question were committed half-unconsciously, as it were, without consideration of right or wrong.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Of course, any disciplinary action is entirely up to the discretion of the Principal, and I have no intention whatsoever of infringing on his prerogatives, but I do hope that allowances will be made and that the measures taken will be as lenient as possible.’Just as the Badger had been acting like a Badger, Redshirt, I saw, was being Redshirt.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Here he was, openly declaring that if the students ran wild it was not they themselves who were to blame, but the teachers.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In other words, when a lunatic bashes somebody on the head it’s the person being bashed that’s the guilty party, and that’s why the lunatic is bashing him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Thanks a lot!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If the students find themselves suffering from an excess of youthful high spirits, let them go out to the schoolyard and try their hands at sumo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Did they really expect me to put up with them half-unconsciously sticking grasshoppers in my bed?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At this rate, if you’re murdered in your sleep Redshirt would probably be ready to claim that that was also done half-unconsciously and let the perpetrators go free.As these thoughts were running through my mind I was thinking about getting up and saying something, but then again there wouldn’t be any point in speaking up unless I could bowl them over with my eloquence.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I have a habit of getting completely tongue-tied when I’m angry – after I get the first couple of words out I’m lost.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even though the Badger and Redshirt were no match for me when it came to character, both of them were certainly smooth talkers and it would be no fun if I gave them an opportunity to pick on me just because I couldn’t express myself properly.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was sitting there trying to think of a way to put my thoughts into the right words when across the table from me the Hanger-on, of all people, suddenly stood up to speak.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What made this clown think that his opinion was worth anything?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘The recent grasshopper incident and the ensuing commotion,’ he intoned in that airy voice of his, ‘are truly extraordinary events, sufficiently grave to compel all of us, as conscientious educators, to contemplate the future of our school with profound concern.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At this juncture it is incumbent upon all of us, as educators, to devote ourselves wholeheartedly to careful reflection upon our own conduct, and to re-establish a firm sense of discipline in our school.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The analyses that our Principal and Assistant Principal have just provided penetrate precisely to the core of the issue at hand and I endorse them without reservation.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"By all means, let the punishment be as lenient as possible.’ These were fine-sounding remarks, but with no meaning, full of fancy Chinese-style phrases that I could barely make head or tail of.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The only part I could make out clearly was the business about endorsing without reservation.Even though I couldn’t understand the point he was trying to make I was in an awful rage by now, and before I could even figure out what I was going to say I was on my feet.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I got as far as ‘I oppose without reservation … ’ but then I was at a loss.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Finally I managed to add that ‘I really can’t stand such a preposterous course of action,’ at which point everybody burst out laughing.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘The fault lies entirely with the students.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If we don’t make them apologize, they’ll be doing this kind of thing all the time.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Expelling them would not be going too far.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The sheer impudence of it … just because they thought there was a new teacher … ’ After I sat down the science teacher, who was seated to my right, spoke up for the weak-kneed approach: ‘It’s true that the students are the ones who are to blame, but if we punish them too severely we could provoke a backlash which would just make things worse.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I agree with the Assistant Principal that a lenient policy is best.’ The Chinese classics teacher on my left also supported a policy of moderation.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The history teacher said that he agreed with the Assistant Principal too.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Damn it!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just about everybody was on Redshirt’s side.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If these characters wanted to get together and run a school, well, let them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As far as I was concerned, though, there were only two choices: either we would make the students apologize or I would resign.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If Redshirt managed to carry the day, I was ready to go right home and start packing my bags.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I knew that I didn’t have enough eloquence at my command to convince this crew of anything, and even if I did, it wasn’t as if I was looking forward to having anything further to do with them anyhow.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I wasn’t going to be associated with the school any longer, why should I care what happened next?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I were to say anything else now they’d only start laughing again, that was for sure.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"So I just sat there, not bothering to speak out.At this point the Porcupine, who had been listening in silence so far, sprang up out of his seat.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was sure that this guy would also declare his support for Redshirt, not that I gave a damn considering that he was my enemy anyway, but in a voice so powerful it seemed to rattle the windows, he said: ‘I am absolutely opposed to the position taken by the Assistant Principal and the rest of you.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That is to say, no matter how you consider the incident in question, there is no getting away from the fact that what we are dealing with here is a group of fifty dormitory students who engaged in a disrespectful attempt to take advantage of a certain newcomer to the teaching staff.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Assistant Principal seems to believe that the cause may be traced to the character of the teacher but, if you will excuse my saying so, I feel that he may have misstated the circumstances.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This new teacher was assigned to night duty in the dormitory very shortly after his arrival here, less than twenty days after coming into contact with the students.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
A bare twenty days was not enough time to enable the students to develop a proper sense of his character as a man of learning.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If he had been treated in such a disrespectful manner because he had proved himself unworthy of respect, there might indeed be reason to make allowances for the students’ conduct, but to excuse the behavior of impudent students who would expose a new teacher to ridicule without cause would, in my opinion, call into question the good reputation of this school.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The spirit of education involves more than the mere imparting of knowledge.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Along with inculcating a noble, upright, and manly character, it also consists, I believe, in the elimination of undesirable traits such as vulgarity, superficiality, and arrogance.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If we were to allow ourselves to temporize out of fear of a backlash or of exacerbating this disturbance, there would be no telling when we could ever rectify such negative tendencies.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It is precisely to strive for the elimination of these tendencies that we serve at this school, and if we were to neglect this duty it would have been better, I believe, for us never to have become educators at all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"For these reasons it is imperative, in my opinion, that we compel the entire body of dormitory students to offer a public expression of apology directly to the instructor in question.’ Having said this, the Porcupine took his seat again with a thump.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The entire room was speechless.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Redshirt began rubbing his pipe again.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I was tremendously happy.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was as if the Porcupine had said everything I had wanted to say for me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Being the simple kind of person I am, I had already completely forgotten how angry I’d been with him, and I glanced over in his direction with an expression of gratitude, but the look on his face was completely oblivious.After a short while the Porcupine stood up again and made the following remarks: ‘I would like to add one more point which I neglected to mention during my previous comments.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It is my understanding that the instructor on dormitory duty on the night in question left his post to pay a visit to the hot spring.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This, I believe, was totally inexcusable.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"For someone who had accepted the responsibility of standing watch over the school to take advantage of the situation and go off to bathe at a hot spring resort, of all places, simply because there was no one present to call him to account, is misconduct of a very serious kind.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It is my hope that along with the disciplining of the students, the Principal will immediately issue a stern reprimand to the party in question.’He was a strange one, all right, this Porcupine: just when you thought he was praising you, he goes and points out your mistakes.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since I had seen how the night duty teacher had gone out for a walk on the night I arrived, I had assumed in all innocence that such things were allowed, and so I had gone off to the hot spring myself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now that it was put to me this way, though, I could see that I’d been wrong.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was no wonder I was being criticized.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"With that I stood up and declared, ‘It is indeed true that I went to the hot spring while on night duty.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This was completely wrong.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I apologize,’ and sat back down, whereupon everybody burst out laughing again.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It seemed like they were going to laugh every time I opened my mouth.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What a worthless bunch!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’d like to see them try to stand up and openly admit that they had done something wrong – of course they couldn’t, which is probably why they were laughing.At that point the Principal announced that, as it appeared that everybody had now voiced their opinions, he would give them his full consideration before he took action.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"(What eventually happened, by the way, was that the dormitory students were confined to their quarters for a week, and they also offered me an apology, to my face.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Considering how I had been prepared to hand in my resignation and go back home right then and there if they had not apologized, it actually might have been better if I hadn’t gotten my way, since things ended up getting so messy anyway, but I’ll explain about all that later.)",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The conference continued with the Principal offering the following comments: ‘Because it is incumbent upon the faculty to exert a positive influence on the student body by setting a proper moral example, I would like to request, as a first step, that teachers refrain from patronizing public eating and drinking establishments.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Of course, exceptions can be made in the case of farewell banquets and other such official functions, but I would ask that you refrain from dining alone in places that are not particularly reputable – places such as noodle shops, for instance, or dumpling shops … ’ As soon as he mentioned these, everyone was laughing again.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Hanger-on glanced over at the Porcupine and murmured ‘tempura’ with a knowing look, but the Porcupine just ignored him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Served him right!Not being that bright, I had a pretty hard time following what the Badger was saying, but I was thinking to myself that if people who ate at places like noodle or dumpling shops couldn’t hold a teaching job, well, there was no hope for a big eater like me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If that’s what they wanted, so be it, but they should have hired somebody who didn’t like noodles and dumplings in the first place.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Here they were appointing me to the position without bothering to mention a word about it, and then they tell me that I’m not allowed to eat noodles and I’m not allowed to eat dumplings; this was a major blow to a fellow like me, who didn’t have any other amusements.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then Redshirt piped up again: ‘Middle school instructors belong, inherently, to the upper stratum of society.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This being the case, the entertainments that they pursue should not be of an exclusively material nature.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
To devote themselves entirely to such pursuits cannot help but exert a negative influence on their characters.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Being human, however, they can scarcely be expected to endure the rigors of provincial life without engaging in diversions of some sort.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It is appropriate, therefore, for them to engage in amusements of an uplifting and spiritual nature, such as fishing, reading works of literature, composing haiku or poems in the modern style, and the like … ’As we sat there in silence, Redshirt went on spouting this nonsense, carried away by the sound of his own voice.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If going out to fish for fertilizer, making silly jokes about goruki and Russian writers, watching your favorite geisha stand under a pine tree, or making up haiku about frogs jumping into old ponds qualified as spiritual amusements, well, so did eating tempura and wolfing down dumplings.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He should have gone and tried washing that red shirt of his instead of preaching to us about those stupid diversions of his.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"By now I was so angry that I asked him, ‘Is going to see the Madonna a spiritual amusement, too?’ This time nobody laughed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
They just looked around at each other with a strange expression as their eyes met.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As for Redshirt, he stood there with his head hanging down and a pained look on his face.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Take that!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Got you that time, didn’t I?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The only one I felt a little sorry for was the Pale Squash, who had turned even paler than ever when he heard these words.7I moved out of my lodgings that very night.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
As I was packing my things the landlady came in and inquired if anything was wrong.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She also told me that if I was upset about anything, all I had to do was say so and they would make the necessary changes.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That was a surprise!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How did there get to be so many of these mixed-up people running around in the world?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How was I supposed to know if she wanted me to leave or wanted me to stay?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She was downright crazy.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Getting into an argument with somebody like this would be a disgrace for any self-respecting Tokyo native, so I went out to find a man with a cart and left the place right away.Leaving was easy enough, but I had no idea where to go.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When the man asked where he should take my things, I told him to just keep quiet and follow me and he’d find out soon enough, and then set off at a lively pace.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I thought the easiest thing would be to go back to Yamashiro-ya, but since I’d only have to leave again anyway, it would actually end up being more of a bother.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
If I just kept walking around I was bound to come across a boardinghouse or a place with a Room for Rent sign sooner or later.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That, I figured, would be the place that fate had ordained for me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I made my way through streets that looked like they’d be nice, quiet places to live, I ended up in Kajiyachō.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This was where families of the samurai class had their mansions, not the part of town to find something like a boardinghouse in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just as I was thinking I ought to head back toward a busier district, I suddenly had a good idea: my esteemed colleague the Pale Squash lived in this neighborhood.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"His family had occupied one of these mansions for generations, so he would be sure to know the area well.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I dropped in at his place and asked him about it, he might be able to come up with a promising suggestion.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Luckily I’d already paid a call on him once before, so I had a pretty clear idea of how to get to his house, and I didn’t have to spend a lot of time wandering around trying to find it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I came to the house that I thought was probably the right one, I went up to the entrance and called out ‘Excuse me!’ twice.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
An elderly lady who looked to be about fifty appeared from inside holding an old-fashioned paper-wick lamp.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Young women are fine with me, too, but somehow seeing an older one always gives me a good feeling.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I guess it’s because I like Kiyo so much, and it just seems to me that the same feeling must apply to old ladies everywhere.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She was a dignified-looking lady with an old-fashioned widow’s short haircut tied neatly in the back; since her features closely resembled the Squash’s I assumed she was his mother.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She invited me in politely, but I explained that I was just there to ask him a quick question about something and had her call him down to the doorway.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I told him about my situation and asked if he could think of any possibilities, he replied that this was indeed a predicament and stood there looking lost in thought for a while.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then he recalled that there was an elderly couple named Hagino who had a house on a street behind his, and they’d once told him that they had an empty parlor room and if he could recommend a reliable boarder they would be willing to rent it out since there was no point in letting it just sit there unoccupied.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He wasn’t sure if it was still available, he said, but we could go and have a look, and he kindly took me there.From that night I boarded at the Haginos’.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It came as a surprise, though, to find out that as soon as I moved out of Ikagin’s the Hanger-on moved into my old room as if nothing could have been more natural.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Even I was shocked by this news.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was beginning to wonder if the world consisted of nothing but scoundrels, each of them busily trying to put something over on everybody else.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was fed up.It was depressing to realize that if this was the way people really were, I’d have to go along with it myself and not allow myself to be outdone by anybody.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When you come right down to it, if living off the proceeds of pickpockets is the only way to get your three meals a day, you really have to wonder if it’s really worth going on.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"On the other hand, if you go and hang yourself when you’ve got a good, healthy body it would be a disgrace to your ancestors, not to mention being bad for your reputation.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now that I thought about it, I would have been better off if I’d taken those six hundred yen and used them to set myself up as a milkman or some occupation like that instead of going to the Institute of Physical Sciences and learning something as useless as mathematics.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I had done that, Kiyo could have stayed with me, and I wouldn’t have been stuck out here worrying about her.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I hadn’t noticed it when we were living together, but now that I had come to the country I finally realized what a good person she was.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
You could look all over Japan but you wouldn’t find many women as good-natured as Kiyo.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She had been suffering from a slight cold when I left Tokyo; now I wondered how she was getting on.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
She must have been really glad to get that letter I sent her.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Still, I should have received a letter back from her by now … For two or three days thoughts like these filled my mind.Since I was so concerned, I would sometimes ask the landlady if there were any letters for me from Tokyo, but she always gave me a pitying look and told me that nothing had come.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Haginos came from samurai stock, and as you might expect they were both people of quality, unlike my previous landlord and landlady.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In the evenings the old man would practice chanting verses from the Noh plays in an odd voice, which was a little hard to take, but he never barged in and asked me if I’d like to have some tea, so things were a lot easier here.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The old lady would sometimes come to my room and chat about this and that.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Why, she wanted to know, hadn’t I brought my wife with me and set up a household here?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked her if I really looked like a married man and informed her that I was, alas, still only twenty-three, she announced in her thick local dialect that ‘It’s perfectly natural that a man of twenty-three should have a wife, na moshi,’ and then tried to make her point by bombarding me with half a dozen examples of men she knew who had gotten married at nineteen or had two kids by the age of twenty-one and the like.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This was too much for me, so I replied, in my best attempt at an imitation of her dialect, that if it was really all right for a man of twenty-three to marry, I wondered if she might help me find a suitable wife.‘Do you really mean it, na moshi?’ she asked back.‘Yes, really really.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I want to get married so badly I can’t stand it.’‘Yes, you would, wouldn’t you, na moshi.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That’s the way everybody feels when they’re young.’ I was at a loss for a reply to this comment.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘But I’m positive that you already have a wife, sir.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You know, I’ve got it all figured out, na moshi.’‘Is that so?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Very perceptive of you.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
And just how did you get it all figured out?’‘How?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Aren’t you always aching to get a letter from Tokyo, and asking me every day if anything has come yet, na moshi?’‘My, my.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Most perceptive!’‘So I was right, wasn’t I, na moshi?’‘Hmm, yes, maybe so.’‘But the young ladies today aren’t like they used to be, you know.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You have to keep an eye on them these days, so you’d best be on your guard, na moshi.’‘How’s that?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Are you telling me my wife has a lover in Tokyo?’‘Oh, no, your wife is fine, but … ’‘Thank goodness, what a relief!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But why should I be on my guard, then?’‘Well, yours is fine … certainly yours is fine, but … ’‘So where are the ones who aren’t so fine?’‘There are plenty of them around here.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You know that young Tōyama lady, don’t you, sir?’‘No, I don’t.’‘You don’t know who she is yet, na moshi?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now, she’s the best-looking young lady in these parts, na moshi.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"So good-looking, in fact, that all the teachers at the school are always calling her “the Madonna,” na moshi.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You haven’t heard, na moshi?’‘So that’s who the Madonna is?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I thought they were talking about some geisha.’‘No, no, it’s one of those foreigners’ words, it seems to be their word for a lady who’s good-looking, na moshi.’‘Ahh, that could be.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"My goodness!’‘I hear that she got that name from the art teacher, na moshi.’‘You mean the Hang—’‘Oh, no, it was Mr Yoshikawa that gave her that name, na moshi.’‘And this Madonna is one of the questionable ones?’‘This Madonna is a questionable Madonna, yes, na moshi.’‘What a shame.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I see what you mean, though – any woman with a nickname has always been trouble.’‘Yes, that’s true, na moshi.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There was that Omatsu the Demon in the Kabuki play, and Ohyaku the Vampire, na moshi … ’‘And the Madonna is like them?’‘That Madonna, na moshi, let me tell you – you know that Mr Koga from the school, the one that kindly brought you here, na moshi, well, she was all set to get married to him, but then, na moshi … ’‘What?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That’s incredible.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I never would have guessed the Squash was so blessed in his love life.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It just goes to show, appearances can be deceiving – I suppose I’ll have to be a little more careful.’‘But then last year Mr Koga’s father passed away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Up till then they had plenty of money, plus they were shareholders in the bank, so everything was just fine, but once he was gone, I don’t know what happened but all of a sudden things stopped going their way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The thing is, Mr Koga is just too nice a man for his own good, and so he was deceived, na moshi.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The wedding kept being put off because of one thing or another, and then that Assistant Principal came along and asked for her hand, na moshi … ’‘Redshirt, you mean?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That scoundrel!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I knew that shirt wasn’t any ordinary fabric … Then what?’‘He had somebody go talk to the Tōyama family on his behalf.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They said something to the effect that they wouldn’t be able to respond right away seeing as they had a commitment with Mr Koga, but they would consider the proposal carefully, na moshi.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Then Mr Redshirt found some people who were able to get him direct access to the Tōyama family.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He began to be a frequent caller, and by and by he managed to win the young lady over, na moshi.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Mr Redshirt did what he did, but the young lady also did what she did, and now nobody has a good word to say about her.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There she was, already engaged to marry Mr Koga, and then when the college man comes along she switches over to him – it was an offense against the god who was watching over that day, I tell you!’‘Absolutely.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Not just the god of that day, either – the god of the next day, and the one after that, it’s an offense against all of them, for all time!’‘And then Mr Koga’s friend Mr Hotta felt sorry for him, so he went to have a talk with the Assistant Principal.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"According to what I’ve heard, Mr Redshirt told him that he had no intention of snatching away a woman who was already engaged to somebody else.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If that engagement were ever broken off he might seek the lady for himself, but for the present he was simply spending time with the Tōyama family and he didn’t see how Mr Koga could possibly have any objection to that.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since there was nothing more that Mr Hotta could say at that point, he just went home.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They say that the two of them have been on bad terms ever since, na moshi.’‘You certainly seem to know a lot about what’s going on.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’m impressed!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"How do you manage to find out so much?’‘In a place this small, you hear about everything, na moshi.’She heard about too much, from my point of view.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At this rate she might know all about my tempura and dumpling incidents, too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This was no easy place to live in, but it did have its advantages: now I knew who the Madonna was, and I understood the relationship between the Porcupine and Redshirt, which would certainly come in handy later on.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The only thing was, I still couldn’t tell who the real bad guy was.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Unless things are set out for me in clear black and white, it’s hard for a simple type like me to figure out which side to take.‘Hmm … I wonder which one is the better person, Redshirt or the Porcupine … ’‘Porcupine?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What are you talking about?’‘That’s what I call Mr Hotta.’‘Well, when it comes to strength Mr Hotta seems to be the stronger of the two, but Mr Redshirt is the one with the college degree, so he has the ability, na moshi.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And when it comes to who’s nicer, Mr Redshirt is the nicer one, too, but I hear that Mr Hotta is more popular with the students, na moshi.’‘So which one is better, then?’‘Well, the one with the higher salary must be the better one, na moshi.’I couldn’t see any point in continuing with this conversation, so I left things at that.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
A couple of days later I came back from school to find the landlady waiting for me with a big smile.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Ah, you’re finally home,’ she said, and handed me a letter.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As she walked off, I saw that it was from Kiyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There were a couple of notes pasted on the envelope, from which I realized that it had been forwarded from Yamashiro-ya to Ikagin’s, and then from Ikagin’s to the Haginos’.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I also realized that it had been kept at Yamashiro-ya for about a week; I guess that being an inn they put up letters there as well as people.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I opened it, I saw that it was a really long one.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Here’s how it started:Dear Botchan,As soon as I got your letter I wanted to write back to you right away, but unfortunately I was in bed for a week with a cold, so it has taken me all this time to write.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’m sorry.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Besides, I’m not as good at reading and writing as the young ladies are these days, so it’s quite a strain for me to write even a clumsy letter like this one.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was going to ask my nephew to write it for me, but then I decided that since I was the one sending it, it wouldn’t be right if I didn’t write it out myself, so I put everything I wanted to say down on paper and now I’m making a clean copy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It has only taken me two days to do this, but it took me four days to get everything down the first time.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I know that my writing may be hard for you to read, but this is the best I could do so please read it through to the end.The letter was on a single sheet of paper that was about four feet long when you unfolded it all the way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She had written about all kinds of things, and yes, it really was hard to read.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It wasn’t just that her handwriting was bad: she had also run her words and phrases so close together that it was a real strain to figure out where one ended and another began.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’m such an impatient type that normally there’s no way I would be willing to read through a letter that was so long and difficult, even if somebody offered me five yen to do it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This one time, though, I really concentrated and read it all the way through from beginning to end.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But since I had to strain so hard just to make out the individual words and phrases I couldn’t work out what they were supposed to mean when you put them together, so then I had to start all over again from the beginning.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"By this time it was getting dark inside the room, which made it even harder to read than it was before, so I took it out to the veranda, sat myself down on the edge, and read it through as carefully as I could.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The early autumn breeze was making the broad leaves of the plantain quiver in the garden, and each time I felt it brushing my skin it would also catch as much of the letter as I’d unfolded and lift it gently in the air, so that by the time I’d read it to the end the full four feet of it were rustling softly; it seemed as if all I had to do was let it slip from my hands and it would go drifting off toward the hedge on the far side of the yard.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But I was hardly in the mood to pay attention to such things, because I was too absorbed in what Kiyo had to say, which went as follows:Botchan, your character is as straight and clear as a length of split bamboo, but there’s one thing I worry about, which is that you have too much of a temper … If you make up all kinds of nicknames for people it will give them a reason to resent you, so you’ve got to be careful about when and where you use them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You should only share them with me in your letters … I’ve heard bad things about country people, so make sure that you don’t get yourself into any trouble … Even the weather must be less settled than it is in Tokyo, so take care not to get a chill and catch cold in your sleep.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Because your letter was so short I couldn’t get much of a picture of what things are like there, so next time please write me one that’s at least half as long as this one … A five-yen tip for the people at the inn is fine if you don’t run short later, just remember that when you’re in the country the only thing you can count on is your money, so you have to spend as little as possible so that you’ll have enough just in case a time comes when you really need it … It must be hard if you haven’t got any spending money, so I’m sending a money order for ten yen.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I put the fifty yen you gave me in a postal savings account to help you out when you come back to Tokyo and get a house, but after I take out the ten yen there will still be forty so it should be all right …Women, I couldn’t help thinking, watch out for every little thing.While I was sitting lost in my thoughts on the veranda with the letter fluttering in the breeze, Mrs Hagino opened the sliding door and brought me my dinner tray.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Oh my,’ she said, ‘you’re still reading your letter, na moshi?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It certainly is a long one, isn’t it, na moshi!’ ‘Yes,’ I told her, ‘it’s an important one, so first I let it blow in the breeze for a while and then I read part of it, then I let it blow again and read some more.’ Even I didn’t know what this was supposed to mean.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As usual, she had made boiled sweet potatoes for dinner.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Haginos were certainly treating me better than the people at Ikagin’s had, and they were nicer people, with better manners, but unfortunately the food here was awful.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Sweet potatoes again tonight – the same as last night, and the night before.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It’s true that I had announced that they were one of my favorite dishes, but I could hardly keep going on a diet of sweet potatoes and sweet potatoes alone.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Here I had been laughing at my colleague the Pale Squash, but now it looked like I’d be turning into a Pale Potato myself any day.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If Kiyo had been there she would have made me some nice tuna sashimi or the roasted fishcakes that I like, but in a poor, penny-pinching samurai household like this one there wasn’t a chance.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter how I looked at it, I needed to have Kiyo with me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If it seemed likely that I’d be staying on at that school for any length of time, I’d have her come down from Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Not allowed to eat a bowl of noodles and tempura?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Not allowed to eat dumplings?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Having to live as a boarder and be fed sweet potatoes till I started to turn yellow myself?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Being a schoolteacher was a tough job – even Zen monks must eat like gourmets compared to this!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After I polished off my plate I took two raw eggs out of my desk drawer, cracked the shells against the rim of my ricebowl, and slurped them down, which finally gave me enough nutrition to keep me going.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How was I supposed to have the stamina to teach twenty-one classes a week if I didn’t fortify myself with raw eggs like that?Because of Kiyo’s letter I was late going to the hot spring for my bath.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But by then I had become so accustomed to going every evening that it wouldn’t feel right if I missed even a single day.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I decided to take the train and headed out with my usual red towel in hand, but by the time I got to the station I had missed the train by a couple of minutes, so I took a seat on a bench to wait for the next one.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I sat there smoking a cigarette, who should turn up but the Squash.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After what I had heard from Mrs Hagino, I was feeling sorrier than ever for him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It had always been kind of pitiful to see the way he kept such a low profile, as if he was just some sort of trespasser in the universe, but pitiful wasn’t the word for it that night.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had just been thinking how if it was in my power there was nothing I’d rather do than double his salary, get him married to the Tōyamas’ daughter, and send them off to Tokyo for a month’s holiday, so of course I gave him a hearty greeting, asked him if he was also going to the hot spring, and tried to give him my seat on the bench.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Squash, whether out of politeness or whatever, just murmured ‘Oh no, please don’t worry about me in the least’ with an apologetic look on his face, and went on standing there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I tried again, telling him that we’d be waiting for a while yet and he’d get tired standing so he might as well sit down.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The truth is, I was feeling so sorry for him that I desperately wanted to get him to sit there with me somehow or other.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Finally he relented with a polite ‘Well, then, begging your pardon.’ What a world!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There are presumptuous types like the Hanger, who insist on sticking their noses into places where it has no business being.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There are guys like the Porcupine who strut around with a look plastered on their face announcing that Japan would be in trouble if they weren’t there.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And then there are the ones like Redshirt who convince themselves that they’ve got the markets in hair oil and manly charm all cornered, or the Badger, whose attitude all but proclaims that he is precisely what Education would look like if it were ever to come to life and put on a frock coat.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Every one of them is puffed up in his own personal way, but I had never seen anyone like Mr Pale Squash, who tried so hard to be meek and unobtrusive that he looked more like a hostage puppet than a man.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Sometimes he made you wonder if he really existed at all.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It’s true that his face was puffy, but if the Madonna had really thrown over an excellent man like him for Redshirt she had to be one hopeless hussy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even if you put together a couple of dozen Redshirts, you couldn’t hope to make such a fine husband out of them!‘Is anything wrong?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You look rather worn out … ’‘Oh, no, I’m not suffering from any particular complaints, but … ’‘I’m glad to hear it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"People aren’t good for much when they’re sick, are they?’‘You certainly seem to be a very healthy fellow.’‘Oh yes, I may be thin but I don’t get sick.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The thing is, I just can’t stand being sick.’The Squash grinned when he heard this.Just then a burst of youthful-sounding feminine laughter rang out by the entrance to the platform.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I turned around for a quick look, and what I saw was really something: a gorgeous woman, tall and fair-skinned, with a stylish hairdo, standing at the ticket counter with a matronly-looking lady in her mid-forties.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’m not any good at describing what makes a woman gorgeous, so I won’t try, but this one was definitely absolutely gorgeous.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Somehow just looking at her made me feel like I was cradling a ball of crystal that had been warmed in perfume in my palm.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The older lady was shorter, but the resemblance in their faces was obvious: they had to be mother and daughter.From the instant I got that first stunning glimpse I couldn’t take my eyes off her.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I had forgotten all about the Squash.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But then, to my surprise, he suddenly got up and started walking over in the ladies’ direction.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This, I realized, might be the Madonna.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The three of them exchanged casual greetings by the ticket counter, but they were too far away for me to make out any of the conversation.I looked at the station clock and saw that we still had another five minutes to wait.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since I no longer had anyone to talk to, I was hoping that the train would come as soon as possible.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just then another passenger came hurrying into the station.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was Redshirt.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He was wearing some kind of thin silk kimono with a carelessly wound crepe sash, with his gold watch chain dangling from it as usual.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This item was a fake.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Redshirt thought that nobody could tell and was always showing it off, but he couldn’t fool me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As he dashed in, he looked nervously around the station, but when he saw the threesome talking in front of the ticket counter he gave them a polite bow and seemed to be exchanging a couple of words with them, but then he suddenly turned and floated over to where I was sitting with that little-cat-feet walk of his.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Ah,’ he said, ‘so you’re off to the springs, too?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was afraid I might miss the train so I rushed over, but I see that we still have a few minutes.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I wonder if that clock is right … ’ As he pulled out his gold pocket watch and announced that there was two minutes’ difference between it and the station clock, he took a seat beside me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Without so much as a glance back toward the ladies, he rested his chin on top of his walking stick and kept his gaze fixed straight ahead.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The older lady looked over at him from time to time, but the young one never faced his way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Now I was sure she was the Madonna.Finally a whistle shrieked and the train pulled in.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The crowd on the platform jostled its way into the cars.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Redshirt made a dash for the first-class seats.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It wasn’t as if going first class was anything to feel superior about: the first-class fare to the hot spring was five sen and second class was three, so there was only a difference of two sen between them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If even a person like me was willing to lay out the extra two sen for that white first-class ticket, which I was, you can see that there wasn’t anything special about it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"These country people seemed to be cheapskates, though; most of them rode second class, so paying two sen more or less must have been a big deal to them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The Madonna and her mother followed Redshirt into the first-class seats.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The Squash would never even think of going first class.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"For a moment he stood at the doorway to the second-class seats with a hesitant look, but as soon as he noticed me he plunged right in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Feeling unbearably sorry for him, I followed him in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I figured that nobody would mind if somebody rode in second class with a first-class ticket.At the hot spring, I ran into the Squash again after I came down into the bathing area in my robe.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even though I can barely squeeze a word out of my throat when it’s my turn to speak at meetings and things, I’m usually pretty talkative by nature, and while we were sitting in the tub I kept trying to strike up a conversation with him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I just couldn’t bear to see him looking so miserable.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As a self-respecting Tokyo native, I thought, it was my duty to offer something, even if only a word or two, that might console the man in his hour of misery.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Unfortunately, though, he just wouldn’t join in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter what I said, all I could get out of him was an ‘Ah’ or an ‘Umm,’ and even coming up with those Ahs and Umms seemed to be a real strain, so eventually I gave up and excused myself.I hadn’t seen Redshirt in the bath.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Of course there were any number of places to bathe at this spa, so even if we came on the same train, there was no reason to expect that we’d end up sharing the same tub.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Coming out of the bathhouse, I noticed that the moon was looking particularly fine that night.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There were willow trees planted on either side of the streets here, and their branches cast round shadows on the ground.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I decided to take a little stroll.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Up at the northern edge of town there was a big gate on the left; beyond it was a roadway that led to a Buddhist temple, but along the way on either side were the houses of a red-light district.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Putting such establishments inside the precincts of a temple was surely a phenomenon without precedent.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I wanted to go in and have a quick look around, but for all I knew it might end up getting me nailed by the Badger again at the next faculty meeting, so I decided not to and walked on by.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Next to the gate was a small building with lattice windows and a dark curtain hanging in the doorway – it was the dumpling shop where I got myself into trouble before.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There was a round lantern with the words SWEET BEAN SOUP and RICE CAKE SOUP hanging by the entrance, casting a patch of light on the trunk of a willow tree that was growing close to the eaves of the building.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I would have loved to go in, but I resisted the temptation and walked on by.Not being able to eat some dumplings when you wanted to felt pathetic.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But to have your fiancée switch her affections to another man was truly pathetic.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Never mind the dumplings, I realized – compared to the Squash, I wouldn’t have had any grounds for complaint even if I had to go without any food at all for three days.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Really, there’s nothing in the world as undependable as human beings.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just looking at her face, you would never have thought that such a gorgeous woman would be capable of doing anything so cruel, but she was; while Mr Koga – puffy, pale, last-squash-on the-vine face and all – was a perfect gentleman.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
You can never let your guard down.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You think that the Porcupine is a simple, honest fellow, and then you hear that he’s been stirring up the students … Then when you think he was the one who was stirring them up, he urges the Principal to give them the punishment they deserve … You think that Redshirt is a walking mass of obnoxiousness, and then all of a sudden he goes out of his way to be nice to you and warn you about the danger you’re in … and you find out that he’s been playing that game of his with the Madonna.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
And then he claims that he has no designs on the woman unless her engagement to Mr Koga falls through.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Ikagin makes up excuses to get rid of me, and then takes in the Hanger right away … However you look at things, you just don’t know what to believe.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
If I wrote to Kiyo about all this I’m sure she’d be flabbergasted.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Maybe she’d say that it just goes to show that anyplace further away than Hakone must be swarming with monsters.I’ve always been pretty easygoing by nature, and up until now I had always gotten by without letting anything bother me too much, but in the mere month or so since I arrived in this town I had suddenly come to see the world as a much scarier place.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even though nothing particularly awful had happened to me, I felt as if I had already aged a good five or six years.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The best thing to do would probably be to cut my stay here short and go back to Tokyo … As these thoughts were running through my mind, I found myself crossing a stone bridge and ending up on the embankment along the Nozeri River.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"To call it a river may make it sound sort of grand, but actually it was more like a burbling brook, only about six feet across.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"About three-quarters of a mile further down along the bank is a village called Aioi, with a temple devoted to Kannon, the goddess of mercy.I turned to look back toward town and saw its red lanterns shining in the moonlight.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I could also hear the booming of giant taiko drums, which must have been coming from the red-light district.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The current in the stream was shallow but swift, making it dance with a nervous-looking shimmer.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I kept wandering aimlessly along the bank, and when I had come what I thought must have been about a quarter of a mile I could see some shadowy figures looming up ahead.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The moonlight was bright enough for me to see that there were two of them.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I thought they might be some young people from the village, on their way home after a visit to the hot spring.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If so, you’d expect them to be singing some song as they went along, but they were surprisingly quiet.I must have been walking faster than they were, and as I got closer the two shadows were gradually getting larger.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
One seemed to be a woman.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I came within about twenty yards of them, the man suddenly turned around.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The moon was shining from behind me, so I could see his features pretty well.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Ah-hah!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The couple started walking again; I, with a certain plan in mind, followed after at full speed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Up ahead, the couple ambled along obliviously at the same leisurely pace they had kept up from the start.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
By now I could hear their voices so clearly I could almost reach out and touch them.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The path along the riverbank was about six feet across, just barely wide enough for three people to walk abreast.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I easily caught up with them, brushed past the man’s sleeve, and then, after pulling two paces ahead of them, turned on my heel and looked the man straight in the face.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The moonlight, without so much as a by-your-leave, clearly revealed my entire face, from my short-cropped hair to the tip of my chin.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The man barely had time to get out a sharp ‘Aa!’ of recognition in a tiny voice and then turn toward his companion and mumble ‘Let’s head back’ before the two of them were on their way back toward the hot spring area.I wasn’t sure if Redshirt had been trying to brazenly bluff his way out of it or if he had simply lost his nerve and run off without acknowledging me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"One thing was for certain, though: I wasn’t the only one who was getting himself into trouble in this little place.8Ever since that fishing trip with Redshirt, I had begun to have my suspicions about the Porcupine.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When he had ordered me to get out of Ikagin’s on some phony pretext, it only confirmed my belief that he was up to no good.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But then at the meeting when he made that eloquent appeal to be strict with the students, he caught me off guard again and I didn’t know what to think.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And then when I heard from Mrs Hagino that he had tried to intervene on the Squash’s behalf with Redshirt, I felt I really had to hand it to him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just as I was starting to wonder if maybe the Porcupine wasn’t the real bad guy after all, if maybe Redshirt was the rogue who had been planting a pack of plausible-sounding but unfounded suspicions and insinuations in my mind, there I was catching him taking the Madonna out for a walk along the Nozeri River.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
From that point on my mind was made up: Redshirt had to be the bad guy.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Actually, I still wasn’t quite sure if he was a bad guy or not, but you certainly couldn’t call him a good one.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Two-faced was what he was.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If a man isn’t as upright as a stalk of bamboo, you can’t trust him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even if you get into a fight with an upright man, you’ll still have a good feeling about it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"A guy like Redshirt – the mild-mannered, kindly, elegant type, always proudly showing off that amber pipe of his – that’s the kind you’d better not trust, I believed, and also the kind you’d better not get into a fight with.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And if by any chance you did get into a fight with him, it wouldn’t be one you could feel good about, the way you could with a match in the sumo tournament back in Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Looking at it this way, the Porcupine – the guy with whom I’d gotten into that argument over a penny and a half that had the whole faculty room in an uproar – was more of a man by far.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When he kept glaring at me with those deep-set eyes of his during the staff meeting I detested him, but afterward I realized that at least it was better than dealing with a smooth, slimy-voiced customer like Redshirt.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In fact, after the meeting I had tried to make up with him once or twice, but the rascal wouldn’t take me up on it; he just kept giving me that evil eye of his, so I got angry at him all over again and the standoff dragged on.Ever since then the Porcupine wouldn’t talk to me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The money I had put on his desk was still sitting there, gathering dust day by day.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I wasn’t about to touch it, of course, and he wasn’t about to take it home with him either.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"On account of this one-and-a-half-sen barrier that stood between us, I couldn’t say anything to him no matter how much I wanted to, and he kept his silence just as stubbornly.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It had turned into a curse on the two of us.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Eventually just coming into school and seeing those coins sitting there became a trial.While the Porcupine and I still wouldn’t have anything to do with each other, my relationship with Redshirt went on as before.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The morning after the Nozeri River incident, as soon as I arrived at school he came over to my desk and started asking me all kinds of questions about how I liked my new lodgings and whether I wouldn’t like to go on another fishing expedition for Russian literature and the like.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I found this attitude of his a little obnoxious, so I mentioned something about how we had run into each other twice the night before.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘at the station – umm, is that the time you always go out?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"On the late side, isn’t it?’ When I hit him with the news that I had also seen him by the Nozeri River, he said no, he hadn’t been there, he’d gone straight home from the bathhouse.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The liar!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There shouldn’t have been any need to hide it; I definitely had seen him there, after all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If a man like him was worthy of being the Assistant Principal of a middle school, well, I must be worthy of being the President of a university.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
From that time on I stopped trusting Redshirt.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But while I was still on speaking terms with him, a man I didn’t trust, I wasn’t talking to the Porcupine, whom I now admired.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This world is a very strange place.One day Redshirt informed me that there was something he wanted to discuss with me and asked me to visit him at home.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This meant that I would have to take a day off from my regular routine of visiting the hot spring, which I regretted, but I set out around four o’clock anyway.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Although Redshirt was still single, he had stopped living in a rented room long ago; now he occupied a house with an imposing entryway befitting his status as an Assistant Principal.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The rent, I had heard, was nine and a half yen a month.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I stood there at the entrance, it occurred to me that if you could get a place like this for nine and a half yen in the country, I really ought to make Kiyo happy by splurging on one myself and bringing her down here from Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I called inside, I was met at the door by Redshirt’s younger brother.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He was one of my students in arithmetic and algebra, and a very poor one.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And as if that wasn’t bad enough, since he was only an outsider here, his character left even more to be desired than those of the local yokels.When I asked Redshirt what it was that he wanted to talk to me about, the great man pulled out that amber pipe of his and, as he puffed on some awful-smelling tobacco, made the following announcement: ‘Since you started teaching for us, the students have been doing much better than they did under your predecessor, and the Principal is very pleased that we’ve acquired such a fine teacher.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"We’re all counting on you, so I hope that you’ll keep applying yourself to your work.’‘Is that so?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, as far as applying myself goes, I don’t see how I can do any more than I’m already doing … ’‘The way you’re doing things now is fine.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I just hope that you won’t forget about that little matter that we talked about a while back.’‘Do you mean that business about getting myself into some real trouble with someone who was helping me find a place to live?’‘Well, if you put it in such explicit terms it loses all meaning, but … well, be that as it may … I think you understand the basic point I’m getting at here, so … Anyway, if you continue to keep up the good work, the school always takes notice of such things, so before too long, as soon as we have the wherewithal, I think that we should be able to do something for you in the way of remuneration … ’‘Oh?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Are you talking about a raise?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’m really not concerned with that kind of thing, but of course if I could get one, then so much the better … ’‘Well, it just so happens that one of our instructors will be transferring out soon – of course, I’ll have to talk to the Principal about it so I can’t guarantee anything yet, but we might be able to take advantage of some of the savings on his salary.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Anyway I’m planning to ask the Principal to see what he can do for you.’‘Thank you very much.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And who is it that’s being transferred?’‘Well, since the announcement is going to be made shortly, I suppose it’s all right to tell you now.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Actually, it’s Mr Koga.’‘What?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Koga?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But isn’t this his hometown?’‘It’s true that he is from here, but due to certain circumstances … it was partly at his own request.’‘Where is he going?’‘To Nobeoka, in Miyazaki Prefecture.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since it’s such a remote place, he’ll be getting a one-step raise in his pay.’‘Will somebody be coming to take his place?’‘We’ve pretty much decided on who his successor will be.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Based on how things work out with him, we should be able to do something for you.’‘That’s fine.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There’s no need to go out of your way to get me a raise, though.’‘Anyway I will be talking to the Principal.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And I think that he sees this the same way that I do, but eventually we may also have to ask you to do something more for us.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I do hope that you’ll be ready and willing.’‘You mean I’ll have to teach more classes?’‘No, in fact you might end up with fewer classes, but … ’‘I’d be working more, but teaching less?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That sounds sort of strange … ’‘Yes, it may sound a little strange … it’s rather hard to go into the specifics right now, but, well, basically, what I’m getting at is that we may be asking you to take on a greater responsibility.’I didn’t get it at all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"A ‘greater responsibility’ would probably mean becoming the head mathematics teacher, but that was the Porcupine’s job, and there was no need to worry about that character resigning any time soon.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What’s more, since he was the students’ favorite, it certainly wouldn’t be a good idea for the school to transfer him or fire him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was always hard to see what Redshirt was really getting at when he told you something, but at least we had now covered the business that we needed to talk about.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As we chatted on a little about this and that, he brought up the topic of the Squash’s farewell party, and then the question of whether I was a drinker, and then something about what a lovable gentleman the Squash was.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Finally, he changed the subject completely and hit me with a question about whether I ever composed haiku.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This sounded like trouble, so I told him that I didn’t, said goodbye, and headed home on the spot.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Haiku is either for masters like Bashō, or for guys like hair stylists.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What business does a math teacher have fooling around with little poems about morning glories and the bucket at the well?When I got back home, I tried to figure it all out.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There was just no accounting for some of the people you find in this world.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even if the Squash had, for some reason, had enough of this hometown of his where he was all set up with both a family house and a job at the school, I couldn’t see why he would want to go off and make life harder for himself in an unfamiliar part of the country.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If he was going to some fine metropolis, the kind of place where at least there were trains running, it wouldn’t have been so bad.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But Nobeoka?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It hadn’t even taken me a month to get my fill of this place, which at least could be reached easily enough by boat.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Nobeoka, on the other hand, is all the way out in the middle of a bunch of mountains – which are in the middle of another bunch of mountains, which are in the middle of even more mountains.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"According to Redshirt, you get off a boat, then there’s a day’s journey by horse-drawn wagon to the city of Miyazaki, and then it’s another full day’s wagon ride from there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just hearing the name of the place makes you think that it couldn’t be very civilized.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It sounds like a town where the inhabitants must be divided about evenly between monkeys and humans.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What kind of whim would make anybody, even somebody as unworldly as the Squash, want to go out there and associate with a bunch of monkeys?Back at the house, the landlady brought me my meal as usual.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘Sweet potatoes again today?’ I asked.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No, she said, today it was tofu, na moshi.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Not that there was that much difference between the two.‘I hear that Mr Koga is moving to Nobeoka.’‘Yes, the poor man, na moshi!’‘Poor man?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If he wants to go, there’s nothing more to say, is there?’‘Wants to go?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Who wants to, na moshi?’‘Who wants to, na moshi?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He does!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He must be doing this on some kind of whim, no?’‘You’ve been good and hoodwinked, I see.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It’s not like that at all, na moshi.’‘You don’t say?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, Redshirt just told me so.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I’ve been good and hoodwinked, then Redshirt must be a lying hoodlum.’‘Of course that’s what he would tell you – but naturally Mr Koga doesn’t really want to go either, na moshi.’‘In other words, you believe both of them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Very even-handed of you.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But what in heaven’s name is going on?’‘This morning Mr Koga’s mother came over, and eventually she told me the whole story, na moshi.’‘And what is the whole story she told you?’‘Ever since her husband died, the Kogas haven’t been as well off as people think, and now that things have become hard for them she went to see the Principal and asked him if he couldn’t arrange to have her son’s salary increased a bit, seeing as how he had been teaching at the school for four years now.’‘I see.’‘The Principal said that he’d give the idea careful consideration, so Mrs Koga left feeling that things would be all right now.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Then she waited to hear that the raise had come through.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She was hoping that it would take a month or so, but what actually happened was that one day the Principal called Mr Koga in and told him that unfortunately the school didn’t have any money to give him a raise.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"However, he’d been notified that there was an opening in Nobeoka, with a salary five yen higher than what he was making here.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This, he thought, sounded like just what Mr Koga had been looking for, so he’d gone ahead and filled out the papers and now Mr Koga should get ready to go.’‘That sounds more like an order than a proposal!’‘That’s right.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Mr Koga would rather have stayed where he was than go away somewhere for higher pay.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He asked the Principal not to transfer him since he has a house here as well as his mother, but the Principal told him it was all decided already, and they had even hired a teacher to replace him, so he had to go.’‘But that’s terrible!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What a trick to play on somebody!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
So Koga really didn’t want to go after all … I kept thinking it just didn’t make any sense.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Going out in the wild and living with the monkeys, just for another five yen a month?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Who would be such a dunce?’‘Dunce?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But he’s a teacher, na moshi!’‘All right, call him whatever you want … But anyway, Redshirt has to be behind this scheme.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What a rotten thing to do – a real sucker punch!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
No wonder he says there’s no problem with giving me a raise.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But if they think I’m going to accept it now, they’ve got another think coming!’‘Will you be receiving a raise, na moshi?’‘They say I will, but I think I’ll turn it down.’‘Why would you do that, na moshi?’‘I just will, no matter what.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Let me tell you, that Redshirt is a fool.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And a rat.’‘Even if he is, if he offers you a raise you’d be better off taking it, no questions asked, na moshi.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When you’re young you get upset about all kinds of things, but then later on you realize that you were only getting yourself into more trouble that way and you should have controlled yourself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The only person you hurt by losing your temper is you, and you’ll end up regretting it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That’s the way it is, so take this old lady’s advice – if Redshirt says he’s going to give you a raise, just say thank you and accept it.’‘Listen, I don’t need an old lady like you telling me what to do when it’s none of your concern.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It’s my salary, no matter how much it goes up, or down, and mine alone.’She left the room without another word.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Her husband was chanting a passage from some Noh play in a relaxed, mellow voice.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The whole point of Noh chanting seems to be to take some lines that you could understand perfectly well on paper and recite them in a ridiculously complicated way to make sure that nobody can understand them any more.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How he managed to practice that stuff every night without getting thoroughly sick of it was a mystery to me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Anyhow I had much bigger things to worry about.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
They’d told me that they were going to give me a raise.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It wasn’t as if I’d especially wanted one, but I figured that it would have been a waste to let them leave the money sitting around doing nothing, so I’d accepted.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But would I be mean enough to take a cut out of the salary of somebody who had been forced to accept a transfer when he really didn’t want to go?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What the hell did they think they were doing banishing the man to the wilds of Nobeoka when he had told them that all he wanted was to stay right here?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even when a famous exile like Sugawara no Michizane was sent to Kyushu, he was allowed to settle in a place no more remote than the outskirts of Fukuoka.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And hadn’t Kawai Matagoro, a notorious murderer, also ended up in a fairly civilized part of the island like Sagara?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway, I’d never forgive myself if I didn’t go to Redshirt and refuse the raise.I changed into a formal outfit and went out.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I stood in that spacious entryway of his and announced my presence, the same brother came out to greet me, this time with a look that said ‘What?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You again?’ Well, I was ready to come as many times as I needed to; if I had to get them out of bed in the middle of the night, so be it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Did he really think I was just there to pay some kind of idle social call?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was there to give my salary back, whether they liked it or not.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The brother told me that Redshirt was with another visitor at the moment; I answered that I would just like to talk with him briefly, even if it was only there in the doorway.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He went back inside.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Looking down at the floor, I noticed a pair of slender wooden sandals with an inlay of woven rush on the tops.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"From inside the house I could hear a voice saying ‘Well, then, it’s time to celebrate – banzai!’ The visitor, I realized, had to be the Hanger-on – that high-pitched voice and the artsy footwear couldn’t have belonged to anybody else.Eventually Redshirt appeared with an oil lamp in his hand and invited me in, announcing that the other caller was none other than Mr Yoshikawa.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I declined and told him that all I wanted was a quick word with him, which I could have right there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
His face was as red as a beet.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He must have been having a drink with the good old Hanger.‘About what you said before about giving me a raise: I’m here to tell you that I’ve been thinking it over, and I’ve decided not to accept it.’Redshirt pushed the lamp out in front of him and studied my face from within the shadows.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Caught off guard and at a loss for a reply, he stood there in a daze.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Maybe he couldn’t believe that he had just encountered the one and only guy in the whole world who would actually turn down a raise, or maybe he just couldn’t imagine why, even if somebody was going to turn it down, they had to come back to announce it so soon after they had walked out the door, or maybe it was some combination of the two, but anyway he just stood there, his mouth looking kind of peculiar as he struggled to get it to work.‘When I accepted that raise before, it was because I thought that Mr Koga was transferring voluntarily, but … ’‘Koga certainly did request a kind of transfer.’‘That’s not what happened.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He wants to stay here.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even if he doesn’t get a raise, he wants to stay in his hometown.’‘Is that what he told you?’‘Well, I didn’t hear it directly from him.’‘Well whom did you hear it from, then?’‘From my landlady – who heard it from his mother.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She told me about it today.’‘So that’s the story the old lady at your place told you, then?’‘Well, yes.’‘Pardon me for saying so, but something is a bit out of order here.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"According to what you’re telling me, I get the impression that you believe what your old landlady tells you, but you don’t believe what your Assistant Principal tells you.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Is that the way I’m supposed to understand it?’He had me there.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
You really have to hand it to these college men.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
They know just how to latch on to some point that you’d never thought of and then keep rubbing it in.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
My old man always used to tell me that I was hopelessly impulsive.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Now I could see what he meant.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I heard what my landlady had to say I was so shocked that I sprang right into action, but I hadn’t made any effort to get a full account from the Squash or his mother.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"So now here I was in a bind, finding it not so easy to parry this collegiate-style attack.It wasn’t easy to parry directly, but in my own heart I had already issued a declaration of no confidence in Redshirt.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"My old landlady may have been a grasping cheapskate, but at least she wasn’t a liar or a hypocrite like him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All I could say was this: ‘What you say may well be true, but all the same I do not wish to receive a raise.’‘This is getting stranger and stranger.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"First you tell me that you’ve come expressly to inform me that due to certain circumstances that you’ve heard about you can’t accept a raise; then, even though I’ve explained that there’s no basis to what you’ve heard, you insist on rejecting it anyway.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I really don’t know what to make of this.’‘Perhaps you don’t, but anyway I refuse.’‘If it bothers you that much I won’t go so far as to force it on you, but doing a complete about-face like this in the space of just two or three hours will have an effect on your credibility in the future.’‘That’s all right with me.’‘Well, it shouldn’t be.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There’s nothing more important in life than trust.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even if I were to concede, just for argument’s sake, that the landlord at your—’‘The landlady, not the landlord.’‘Either way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyhow, even if we were to suppose that what the old lady told you was true, the money for your raise isn’t being taken out of Koga’s salary, is it?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He goes off to Nobeoka.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"His replacement arrives, and goes to work for slightly less pay.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"We’re simply assigning the differential to you, so there’s really no need for you to feel sorry for anyone.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Koga will be better off in Nobeoka, and the new man is committed to working for less from the beginning.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"So if this allows your pay to go up, I don’t see how things could have worked out any better.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you still object, so be it, but why don’t you go home and think it all over carefully one more time?’I can’t boast much about my brainpower, so normally if somebody subjects me to a smoothly polished line of talk like this, I’ll give in and concede that it might very well be true and that I’m the one who’d been in the wrong – but not that night.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Ever since I first got to town, there was something about Redshirt that had rubbed me the wrong way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At one point I had changed my mind and decided that he was a kindhearted fellow in a feminine sort of way, but now, when it was becoming clear that there was really nothing kind about him at all, that backlash effect just made me dislike him all the more.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"So no matter how powerfully he laid out those fine and logical arguments of his, no matter how hard he tried to overwhelm me with his Assistant Principalian grandeur, I didn’t care.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just because somebody can out-argue you, that doesn’t necessarily make them a good person.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And the person who gets out-argued isn’t necessarily a bad person, either.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"To all appearances, what Redshirt had to say made perfect sense, but splendid as it sounded, that still didn’t give it the power to seduce you deep down in your heart.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you could really win people’s hearts over with the power of money, authority, or reasoning, then moneylenders, policemen, and college professors would be more popular than anybody else.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There was no way that my heart was going to be swayed by the logic of some middle school Assistant Principal.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"People operate on their likes and dislikes, not on logic.‘What you have to say is perfectly true, but I don’t want that raise any more; anyway, I won’t accept it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Thinking it over won’t change a thing.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Goodbye.’ As I went back through the gate, I noticed the Milky Way streaming across the sky overhead.9When I went to school on the morning of the day of the farewell banquet for the Pale Squash, the Porcupine suddenly offered me this long-winded apology:‘The other day when Ikagin came and told me that you were just too rough for them, and then asked me to do them a favor and see if I could get rid of you, I took him at his word.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But later I found out that he’s actually a shady character who goes around selling fake paintings stamped with phony seals, so I realized that what he said about you must have been false as well.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When he saw that you weren’t going to have anything to do with him and he wouldn’t be able to make any money off you by selling you some scrolls and antiques, he came up with that cock-and-bull story of his.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I didn’t know what kind of man he was, and I hope you can forgive me for having treated you so badly.’Without a word I picked up the one and a half sen which were still sitting on the Porcupine’s desk and put them in my coin purse.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘You’re taking them back?’ he asked incredulously.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Yeah,’ I explained, ‘I didn’t want to accept any favors from you so I was determined to return your money, but when I thought things over later I decided that it was better to accept after all, so I’m taking these back.’ The Porcupine broke into a loud guffaw and asked ‘Well, in that case why didn’t you do it sooner?’ When I told him that actually I’d been meaning to do it for a long time, but somehow it felt funny so I just left the coins sitting there, and that lately I’d been feeling so bad about it that I dreaded the idea of coming to school, he said that I was obviously the kind of guy that just couldn’t stand giving in to anybody.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You’re a pretty stubborn case yourself, I shot back.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then came the following exchange:‘So where are you from, anyway?’‘I’m an Edokko – Tokyo born and Tokyo bred.’‘Ah, an Edokko.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No wonder you hate to give in.’‘And what about you?’‘I’m from Aizu.’‘Aizu, huh?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That explains it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Stubborn!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Are you going to the farewell banquet?’‘Sure.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What about you?’‘Of course I am.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’m even planning to go down to the harbor to see him off when he leaves.’‘It’s going to be an interesting party.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just you wait and see.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’m ready to drink up a storm.’‘Suit yourself.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’m going to have myself something to eat and then get right out of there.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"People who drink are idiots.’‘You don’t waste any time when it comes to picking fights, do you.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Typical Edokko hothead!’‘Whatever.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyhow, can you stop by my place on your way over tonight?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There’s something I want to talk to you about.’He came by as requested.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What I wanted to tell him was this: every time I caught sight of the Squash lately I felt so sorry for him that I could barely stand it, but now that the time to say goodbye had finally come I felt even more miserable – so much so that I would have been glad to go in his place if I could.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was thinking I’d like to make a big speech at the banquet and give him a really splendid send-off, but with my rough-cut Tokyo style of talking I’d never be able to make it sound right, so it occurred to me that I’d be better off if I could get the Porcupine to do the talking; with that booming voice of his he ought to be able to scare Redshirt right out of his wits.I started off by bringing him up to date on the Madonna situation, but of course he knew more about it than I did.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I told him about what I’d seen by the Nozeri River and how I thought that Redshirt was a total idiot, to which he replied by accusing me of calling everybody I met an idiot.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Hadn’t I called people like him the very same thing just that morning in school?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If he was an idiot, he added, then Redshirt certainly couldn’t be one, because they had nothing in common.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All right, I said, in that case Redshirt was a gutless nincompoop, to which the Porcupine immediately agreed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter how tough he was, the Porcupine was no match for me when it came to knowing a lot of juicy insults.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I guess that Aizu people don’t have a lot to offer in that department.Then I brought up the issues of my pay raise and Redshirt’s remarks about assigning me some heavier responsibilities.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘In that case, he must be planning to get rid of me,’ the Porcupine said with a snort.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked him if he was willing to be relieved of his duties, he said absolutely not, and haughtily announced that if he was going to be relieved, he would make sure that Redshirt went with him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But when I came back at him with the question of just how he intended to get Redshirt relieved, he admitted that he hadn’t considered that part yet.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The man certainly looked strong, but as far as brainpower went it seemed he didn’t have that much going for him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then I explained how I had turned down that offer of a pay raise, which made him very happy: ‘Just leave it to an Edokko to pull off something like that!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Well done!’I asked him how come he hadn’t stepped in to try and keep the Squash here when it was so obvious that he didn’t want to leave.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"By the time the Squash had told him about it, he said, everything had already been settled.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He had tried appealing to the Principal twice and to Redshirt once, but nothing could be done.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway, he continued, part of the problem was that Koga was simply too nice a person.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When Redshirt broke the news to him, he should have refused outright, or said that he would think it over at least, but instead he let himself be taken in by all that smooth talk and accepted it on the spot, so that when his mother went to plead his case later, and when the Porcupine himself went to make his appeal, it was totally useless.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"All very regrettable.The whole thing, I suggested, was probably nothing more than a scheme by Redshirt to get the Squash out of the picture so that he could get his hands on the Madonna himself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No doubt about it, said the Porcupine: that guy may look harmless enough, but he’s always got some cunning scheme up his sleeve, and when anybody calls him on it, he’s got his escape route all figured out in advance.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
A truly shifty customer.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The only way to deal with somebody like that is to beat it out of him, he continued, rolling up his sleeve and showing me the muscles on his brawny arm.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Pretty powerful-looking,’ I said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Do you practice jujitsu?’ ‘Just feel this,’ he said, and flexed his bicep.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I gave it a squeeze.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It felt as hard as the pumice stone that you rub your skin with at the bathhouse.I was so impressed that I told him that with arms like those he could probably beat up five or six Redshirts at a time.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Beyond a doubt,’ he said, bending and unbending his arm as the lump in his bicep rippled up and down beneath the skin.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I really enjoyed watching this display.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"According to him, if you tied a thick cord of twisted paper tightly around his arm, he could snap it simply by flexing that bicep of his.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I said that I could probably do the same thing myself, he said ‘You think so?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, why don’t you go ahead and try it, then?’ Better not to take up the challenge, I decided, since it would have been pretty embarrassing if it turned out that I couldn’t do it after all.‘How about it,’ I asked, just for fun, ‘are you ready to give Redshirt and the Hanger-on a nice working over after you’ve done your drinking tonight?’ The Porcupine gave this idea some thought, but finally said no, tonight was not the night.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked why not, he pointed out that it wouldn’t be fair to Koga, and besides, if he was going to give them a beating, it would have to be some time when he had caught them red-handed doing something bad, so that he wouldn’t look like the offending party.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This all sounded quite sensible.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Porcupine, slow-witted as he was, still seemed capable of being more thoughtful than I was.‘Well, then,’ I said, ‘when you make your speech, be sure to say all kinds of good things about the Squash.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I tried it, it would just sound like Edokko chatter, too lightweight to do him justice.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And besides, whenever I’m on the spot and have to come out and say my piece, I suddenly feel like there’s a big wad of something stuck in my throat and I get all choked up and can’t get a word out – so I’m counting on you.’ ‘That’s a strange kind of condition,’ the Porcupine mused.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘So, you can’t express yourself in company?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That must be a problem.’ No, I said, it really wasn’t a problem at all.By and by the time came for the Porcupine and me to set off for the banquet.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was being held at a restaurant called Kashin-tei, which was supposed to be the fanciest in town.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I had never set foot in the place before.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had heard that the building used to be the mansion of one of the senior retainers of the local feudal lord; later it had been sold off and turned into a restaurant with a minimum of remodeling, and it certainly did retain an imposing appearance.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Converting a senior retainer’s residence into an eating-and-drinking establishment seemed a little like taking a warrior’s magnificent battle robe and turning it into underwear as far as I was concerned.By the time we arrived most of the others were already there, scattered in groups of two or three in a thirty-foot-square banquet room.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As you might expect in such a grand room, the decorative alcove was wonderfully spacious, too; even the alcove in my old room at the inn simply didn’t compare.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This one measured a full twelve feet across.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"On the right side was a Seto ware vase with a red pattern, holding a large pine branch.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I wasn’t sure what the point of using a pine branch as a decoration was, but I suppose they were trying to be economical and chose something that would keep its leaves for a couple of months.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I asked the science teacher where he thought that piece of Seto ware came from.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘That’s not Seto, it’s Imari,’ he announced.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I told him that I thought that Imari was a kind of Seto ware, he just laughed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Later I found out that the term Seto ware strictly refers to pottery made in a place called Seto.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Being an Edokko, I had just assumed it was the name for all kinds of ceramics.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In the middle of the alcove was a big hanging scroll, with something written in four lines of seven Chinese characters, each of them as big as my face.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It looked very poorly done to me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I couldn’t understand why such an ugly piece was being displayed so prominently, but when I asked the Chinese classics teacher about it, he informed me that it was the work of a famous calligraphy master named Kaioku.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Kaioku or whatever, I still think it was badly done.Eventually the secretary, Kawamura, asked us to take our seats.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since we were sitting on the floor, I chose a spot that had a pillar behind it that I’d be able to lean my back against.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Principal, attired in a formal kimono with ceremonial skirt and jacket, occupied the seat of highest rank, directly in front of the Kaioku scroll.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Redshirt, in a similar outfit, occupied the place to his left.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"To his right was the guest of honor, the Pale Squash, also in Japanese dress.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was in a Western suit, which made it uncomfortable for me to sit in the formal position with my legs folded under me, so I promptly began sitting with my knees crossed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Next to me was the physical education teacher, in black trousers, sitting in a proper formal position; as you would expect from somebody who taught that subject, his self-discipline showed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Finally the trays with our meals were brought out.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There were flasks of saké, too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The teacher who was in charge of making the arrangements rose and delivered some brief introductory remarks.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then the Badger rose, followed by Redshirt.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Each of the three offered his own parting tribute but, in such a similar style it made you wonder if they hadn’t coordinated the whole thing in advance, they all proclaimed their admiration for the Squash’s stellar qualities as an educator and as a human being, followed by expressions of profound regret at his impending departure and the great loss that it represented not only for the school but on a personal level, and protestations that as it had been his earnest desire to obtain a transfer due to various personal circumstances, they were left with no alternative but to honor his wishes.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
None of them showed the slightest sense of shame at uttering such barefaced lies at a farewell banquet.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Redshirt was the most effusive of all – he even had the audacity to claim that the loss of such a fine friend was a great personal misfortune for him.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Moreover, since his remarks sounded so convincing, and were delivered in a tone that was dripping with even more gentility than usual, anybody who happened to be listening to him for the first time would undoubtedly have been taken in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This must have been the way he got the Madonna to fall for him, too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Midway through this farewell speech of Redshirt’s, the Porcupine flashed me a withering glance from across the way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I silently signaled back my own disgust by pulling my lower eyelid down with my finger.No sooner had Redshirt taken his seat than the Porcupine shot up as if he’d hardly been able to wait for this moment to come.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Impulsively I began to clap my hands in glee, but as the entire assembly, from the Badger on down, turned their eyes in my direction, it made me feel a little uneasy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Porcupine’s speech, which I had been anticipating so eagerly, went like this:‘We have just heard, first from our Principal and especially from our Assistant Principal, how deeply they regret the transfer of Mr Koga.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I, however, take a somewhat different view: I look forward eagerly to his departure from this place, and as quickly as possible.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Nobeoka is indeed a remote location, and in comparison with our town it may present some inconveniences from a material point of view.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But from what I have heard, its ways remain simple and unspoiled, and the faculty and student body there all retain the plain and solid virtues of olden days.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In such a place you will find, I believe, not a single fashionable knave who showers you with false-hearted flattery, or seeks to use his pleasing features to mislead a gentleman.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In such a place a warm-hearted, virtuous person like yourself will be certain to be welcomed with open arms by all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Therefore, Mr Koga, I heartily congratulate you on the occasion of this auspicious transfer.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Finally, I would like to offer a humble wish that once you have established yourself in Nobeoka, you will as soon as possible find yourself a well-bred young lady, one who is qualified to serve as a suitable companion to a true gentleman, and proceed to establish a harmonious home and family with her, and by so doing bring mortal shame upon a certain fickle and faithless hussy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Ah-hemm, ah-hemm … ’Having cleared his throat noisily a couple of times, the Porcupine sat back down.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I wanted to clap again but, afraid of attracting everybody’s attention again, I held back.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
After the Porcupine the next to rise to speak was the Squash himself.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Leaving his own seat and walking down to the spot reserved for the lowest-ranking member on the opposite side of the room, he politely offered his salutations to the audience and then proceeded to declare that ‘In all sincerity I can find no words to adequately express how deeply moved I am by this magnificent send-off which my esteemed colleagues have been so kind as to bestow upon me on the occasion of my relocation, due to personal circumstances, to Kyushu.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In particular, I am most grateful for the unforgettable farewell messages which I have just received from the Principal, the Assistant Principal, and others.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I prepare to embark on a journey to a distant place, it is my hope that you will not banish me from your thoughts, and will continue to favor me with the same generous support that you have so kindly conferred upon me in the past.’ Then, with a profound and humble bow, he returned to his seat.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It seemed that there was virtually no limit to the goodness of the man’s character.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Here he was deferentially expressing his gratitude to the Principal and Assistant Principal who had been playing him for a fool.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This would have been remarkable enough even if it had only been a matter of empty formalities, but judging from the way he held himself, the words he used, and the expression on his face, you would have to say that his emotions were genuine.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"To be offered the sincere appreciation of a man as saintly as this should have been enough to inspire feelings of pity and shame in anybody, but the Badger and Redshirt just sat there and soaked it all up with a straight face.Once the speeches were over, the next sounds to be heard were the slurping noises that arose all around the room as everyone began attacking their soup.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I gave it a try too, but it tasted awful.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There were also some pieces of fish cake, but they had a strange, smudgy color that made them look as though somebody had tried to roast them but given up halfway through.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There was sashimi, too, but the slices had been cut so coarsely that they might just as well have served us slabs of raw tuna steak.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"My fellow guests on both sides, apparently undeterred, were busy devouring everything as if this was some kind of splendid feast.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I guess they had never had a chance to try the kind of fresh fish we enjoy in Tokyo.In due course flasks of heated saké started to be passed around one after another, and all over the room the mood promptly took on a livelier tone.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The Hanger-on made straight for the Principal’s seat and reverentially accepted a drink from him.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What a creep!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The Squash went from one guest to the next and exchanged drinks with each of them; apparently he was intending to make his way around the entire room.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This was really above and beyond the call of duty.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
When he came to my place he politely straightened out the pleats of his formal kimono skirt and requested the honor of sharing a cup with me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Painfully I folded my trousered legs into a formal seated position and poured.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘What a shame,’ I said, ‘that we have to say goodbye so soon after I’ve arrived.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
When do you leave?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I hope you won’t mind if I go down to the harbor to see you off.’ The Squash answered that I shouldn’t bother, since I was undoubtedly very busy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Regardless of what he said, though, I was determined to take time off from school and go see him off.By the time an hour or so had passed, things were starting to drift out of control.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"A couple of people were already pretty tipsy: ‘Go on, have yourshelf another drink … No no, I told you to have one, I inshisht … ’ This was becoming a little tedious, so I excused myself and headed for the bathroom.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I stood in the courtyard admiring the old-fashioned garden by the light of the moon, the Porcupine appeared.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘How about it, pretty good speech, wasn’t it?’ He was obviously quite pleased with himself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I agreed that it was excellent, but there was one comment that I did object to.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When he asked me what it was, I answered, ‘Didn’t you say something about not finding a single fashionable knave in Nobeoka, somebody who would use his pleasing features to mislead a gentleman?’‘So?’‘“Fashionable knave” didn’t go far enough.’‘Well, what should I have said, then?’‘You should have told him that he wouldn’t find a single fashionable knave – or swindler, or weasel, or sneak thief, or flimflam man, or snake-oil salesman, or stool pigeon, or any characters so low that you couldn’t tell the difference between them and a dog if you heard them say “Woof!” … ’‘I couldn’t have come up with all that if I tried.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
You’re the one who has a way with words.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I mean, what a vocabulary!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I can’t believe that you’re no good at making speeches.’‘Come on, that’s all just stuff that I keep stored in my head so that I’ll have it good and ready in case I ever get into a fight.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You can’t use words like that when you’re making a speech.’‘Hmm, I wonder.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway, you really know how to pour it on.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Let’s hear that one more time.’‘As many times as you want: fashionable knave or swindler or weasel … ’ Just as I was getting warmed up, a pair of figures suddenly came staggering toward us, thumping their way along the boards of the courtyard veranda.‘Hey!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Whadda you two think you’re doing running out on ush like that?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"We’re not gonna let you get away sho easily … C’mon, now, drink up!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"… Weasels, huh?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Hey, I like that … C’mon … weasel all have a drink together … ’Before we knew it, they were busy pulling us back inside.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Actually, the two of them must have come out to look for the bathroom, but I guess they were too drunk to remember about that when they started dragging us in.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It seems that drunks can get so distracted by anything that happens to be in front of their nose at the moment that they forget all about whatever it was they were trying to do before.‘Look here, gen’lmen!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Weasel just pulled these two back in!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Now give them shomething to drink … Weasel get these weasels sho drunk they’ll shay weeee … can’t drink any more!!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now, don’t you run out on us!’They pinned me flat against the wall, even though I wasn’t even trying to run out.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I looked around the room and saw that there wasn’t a single tray left with anything to eat on it.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Some people, after they had finished off everything on their own tray, had set off on raiding parties and were cleaning out others a dozen yards away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Somewhere along the line, the Principal had disappeared.At this point in the proceedings, a group of three or four geisha stuck their heads in the room and inquired, ‘Is this the place?’ This was a bit of a surprise, but since I was still pinned against the wall all I could do was stand there and observe the scene.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Redshirt, who had been leaning against one of the pillars by the alcove with a self-satisfied look as he puffed on that amber pipe of his, sprang to his feet and made a sudden move for the door, but when he crossed paths with the geisha as they came into the room, one of them, the youngest and prettiest-looking, stopped and greeted him with a smile.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They were too far away for me to hear what she was saying, but it seemed to be nothing more than ‘Oh, my!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Good evening!’ Redshirt just ignored her and sailed on out of the room; that was the last we saw of him for the night.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I guess he must have followed the Principal’s lead and gone home.With the arrival of the geisha the atmosphere immediately got very jolly indeed, and the noise level shot way up as well: it sounded like everybody was shouting at once to welcome the ladies into the fun.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"One guy tried to play some kind of guessing game with them, yelling at the top of his lungs, the way fencers in a quick-draw contest do when they’re trying to intimidate the opposition.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Closer to me some other guys were totally engrossed in a game of Odd or Even, screaming and wiggling their hands so deftly they could have put the marionettes in a puppet show to shame.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In a far corner somebody was shouting ‘Hey, c’mon over here and pour me a drink!’ As he waved his flask around he must have noticed it was empty, and switched his demand to ‘Hey, more saké!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
More saké!’ All this yelling and commotion was just too much for me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And in the midst of it all one person sat there at a loss as to what to do with himself, eyes cast downward, sunk deep in thought.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This was the Squash.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The reason they were giving him this farewell banquet wasn’t because they were sad to see him go.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It was to give themselves an excuse to drink and have some fun.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was to make him feel miserable, sitting there alone, not knowing what to do with himself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If this was the best they could do by way of a farewell party, he would have been much better off if they hadn’t bothered at all.Eventually the rest of them started singing something or other in sloppy, raucous voices.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"One of the geisha came over to me with her shamisen at the ready and said ‘You there, come on, give us a song,’ but when I told her that I didn’t sing and that she could sing something herself instead, she treated us to a ballad:Beating a drum and banging a gongWith a chanchikirin and a dondokodonWe’ll go out looking for the little lost boy.And if you find the boy for youBeating a drum and banging a gongWell there’s someone I want to look for tooWith a chanchikirin and a dondokodon …Somehow she managed to get through all this on just two breaths, and then said ‘Whew, I’m all worn out.’ Too bad she didn’t try something easier if this was going to wear her out.Meanwhile the Hanger had come over and sat himself down next to her, saying ‘Oh, poor Suzu-chan – just when it seemed like she’d finally found that someone she was looking for, he goes right home!’ To this comment, which was delivered in the music-hall storyteller style he often affected, she sulkily replied ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’ The Hanger, totally oblivious, went right on, this time in an awful imitation of the narrator in a puppet drama: ‘By chance did they meet, and yet … ’ The geisha squealed ‘Stop it!’ and slapped him on the knee; the Hanger-on beamed with delight.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This was the same geisha that had said something to Redshirt before.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Any man who could look so pleased when he got slapped by a geisha had to be a dolt.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He wasn’t finished with his antics, either: ‘And now I’m going to dance “Kiinokuni” – Suzu-chan, play it for me please … ’On the other side of the room the old Chinese classics teacher was contorting his toothless mouth as he squeezed out a passage from one of the puppet plays: ‘How can you say that, Denbei?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The bond between you and me … ’ Having managed to get through that part safely, he turned to a geisha and asked ‘Er, then what?’ Old men do have a way of losing their memories.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Another geisha had gotten hold of the science teacher: ‘There’s a brand new song that’s going around,’ she purred, ‘and it goes like this.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Let me play it for you, listen carefully now!’ She proceeded to sing something about a girl who does her hair in the latest fashion, all tied up with a pretty white bow, rides around town on a bicycle, plays on a violin, and chatters away in broken English, telling everyone ‘I am glad to see you.’ ‘Yes, that’s a good one,’ said the science teacher, obviously impressed ‘– it’s even got some English in it, doesn’t it?’Then it was the Porcupine’s turn.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In a ridiculously loud voice, he bellowed that he was going to perform a sword dance and commanded the geisha to accompany him on their shamisens.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The ladies, stunned by the ferocity with which this order was issued, made no response.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Unfazed, the Porcupine picked up a walking stick, marched off alone to the center of the room and, declaiming the classical lyrics ‘Through the mists that veil a thousand peaks I tread my way,’ revealed a long-hidden artistic talent.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Meanwhile the Hanger, having danced his own way though ‘Kiinokuni,’ as well as some other favorites such as ‘Kappore’ and ‘Tana no daruma,’ had started parading around the room stripped down to his loincloth with a palm-leaf broom for a sword, singing ‘Peace Talks with China Have Been Broken Off.’ The man must have been out of his mind!I was feeling tremendously sorry for the Squash, who was sitting stiffly through all this without undoing his formal kimono skirt, looking terribly uncomfortable.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It was impossible to see why anybody should have to put up with sitting through his own farewell party in full formal dress while being subjected to the spectacle of a man prancing around in a loincloth, so I went over and urged him to leave with me, but he showed no signs of being willing to move.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Since it’s my farewell banquet,’ he said, ‘it wouldn’t do for me to leave before the others, but please go right ahead yourself.’‘Don’t worry about them,’ I told him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘If this is a farewell party, they should be acting like they were at a farewell party.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just look – they’re madmen!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Come on, let’s go!’ Finally I was able to overcome his reluctance, but just as we were on the point of escaping the Hanger charged up with his broom waving furiously and shouted ‘What is the meaning of this!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The guest of honor leaving first?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It’s an outrage!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Peace talks with China!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I won’t let you go!’ Holding his broom out sideways as a barrier, he blocked the way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was already pretty riled up by this point, so I yelled ‘Well, if peace talks with China have been broken off, you must be the Chinaman!’ and let him have a healthy whack on the head.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He just stood there in a kind of stupor for a couple of seconds, as if all the sense had suddenly been knocked out of him, then launched into an incoherent rant: ‘Outrageous!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"To have laid a hand on me, sir, was most cruel!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That I, Yoshikawa, should be subjected to bodily harm – how dare you?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This, sir, is the final rupture of Sino-Japanese negotiations!’ The Porcupine, noticing that some kind of fracas had erupted, broke off his own sword dance and came running up from behind.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
As soon as he saw how badly the situation was deteriorating he grabbed the Hanger by the neck and jerked him away.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘Sino-Japanese … Ouch!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That hurts!!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Such violence!’ The Hanger tried to wriggle free but was wrenched sideways and fell to the floor with a resounding thump.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I don’t know what happened after that.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I walked part of the way back together with the Squash before saying goodbye; by the time I got home it was past eleven.10The war was over and classes were cancelled on account of the victory celebration.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"A ceremony was going to be held at the parade ground in town; the students would be marching in the procession, with the Badger leading the way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I was also to participate as a member of the faculty.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
When we got to town there were Japanese flags flying all over the place; the scene was so dazzling it made your head swim.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The student body numbered eight hundred.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"According to the plan, the physical education teacher would organize them into neat ranks and files, arranged by classes, with one or two teachers marching along as supervisors in the gaps between one class and the next.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"An exceedingly well thought out plan to be sure, but the reality turned out to be exceedingly messy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Not only were the students still children, they were cheeky ones into the bargain, and naturally they would have considered it a disgrace if they failed to throw a monkey wrench into the proceedings.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
No matter how many teachers were there to try and keep them in line it was a lost cause.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"First they would break into a soldiers’ marching song, even though nobody had directed them to do it; then they’d send up a series of ragged battle cries as if they were a bunch of renegade samurai swaggering around the town.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The intervals between the marching songs and the yells were filled with noisy chatter.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You’d think they’d be able to walk in a straight line without saying anything, but Japanese people are born mouth first, so all our scolding just fell on deaf ears.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And it wasn’t just ordinary chatter, either: they were busy badmouthing their teachers, really low-grade stuff.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I had imagined that once I’d forced an apology out of the students after the night-duty incident things would probably settle down.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In the event, though, things turned out very differently.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As my old landlady might have put it, I’d been good and hoodwinked.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The students had apologized, all right, but it wasn’t because they sincerely regretted what they’d done.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Principal had ordered them to do it, so they came to me and bowed their heads, but it was only an empty gesture.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just like those shopkeepers who bow their heads to you obsequiously while they go right on cheating you, these kids might apologize, but there was no way they’d ever stop making trouble.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When you stop and think about it, maybe the whole human race is made up of people like those students.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
So anybody who takes other people at their word and pardons them when they apologize for something or beg for forgiveness deserves to be called a fool for being too honest.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If people’s apologies aren’t the real thing, you might as well think of their forgiveness as not being the real thing either.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"To get a genuine apology from somebody, you’re going to have to keep beating them until their regret is genuine too.As I walked along between the class groups, I could hear comments about tempura this and dumplings that, over and over again.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"With so many kids, it was impossible to pick out the ones who were saying all this.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Of course, even if I could, they would just claim that they hadn’t said anything of the kind, and that I was hearing things because I had a warped mind or was having a nervous breakdown or some other such nonsense.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This vile attitude of theirs was an ingrained habit that had been nurtured in their region since feudal times, so no matter how hard you tried to persuade them or browbeat them, there was no cure for it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After a year in a place like this, even somebody untainted like me might find himself having to do as the locals do and end up the same way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
There was no way that I was going to let anybody throw mud in my face and then get out of taking responsibility for it with some slick kind of dodge.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Was I any less of a person than they were?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even if they were schoolboys, even if they were just kids, they were already bigger than I was.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That being the case, it wouldn’t be right if I didn’t manage to make them pay with some kind of punishment.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But if I tried to go after them by one of the usual methods, they were sure to come right back after me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I told them that they’d done something wrong and were only getting what they deserved, they’d have their excuses all ready beforehand and eloquently proclaim their innocence.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Not only that, they’d also manage to create the impression that they were actually the fine, upstanding ones and go on to attack me for having picked on them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since my whole point was to exact some payback, there would be no point to it unless their misconduct was established.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In other words, if they could attack me and then get everybody to believe that I was the one who had started the fight, they’d have me over a barrel.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But then if I let them have their way and played the part of an easygoing, spineless chump, it would only make them that much bolder – or, to look at things on a grander scale, it wouldn’t help make the world a better place.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"So, basically, this meant that I had no choice but to adopt the tactics of my opponents and find a way to get retribution without being tripped up in the process.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That would be the end for me as a self-respecting Edokko.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But if I was going to have to put up with a year of this kind of treatment, well, I’m human too, so whether it meant throwing away my self-respect or whatever, that’s the way I’d have to do it if I was ever going to settle the score.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The only way out of this mess was to go back to Tokyo and rejoin Kiyo right away.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Staying on in a boondock like this was like pushing myself toward my own downfall.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even taking a job delivering newspapers would have to be better than that.As I dragged myself along keeping my place in the procession with these thoughts running through my head, I suddenly became aware of some kind of commotion at the head of the column.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At the exact same moment, the lines of marchers came to a sudden halt.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Wondering what was going on, I slipped out past the right end of the line and surveyed the scene.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Up ahead where the road turned the corner from Otemachi into Yakushimachi, the marchers had stopped in their tracks.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I could see a lot of jostling going on: some of the students were busy trying to shove people out of the way; others were getting shoved back themselves.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The physical education teacher came running back toward us, hoarsely calling for everyone to stay calm.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked him what was going on, he reported that our students had bumped into a column of students from the local normal school up at the corner.According to what I was told, the students in middle schools and normal schools in any provincial town fight like cats and dogs.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I don’t know why this is, but it does seem as if they rub each other the wrong way, and any little thing can touch off a fight.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Probably they get so bored living in these little country towns that they just do it to help pass the time.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now, I like a good fight myself, so when I heard that a brawl had broken out I ran up to see what was going on.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I could hear the kids at the front shouting ‘Out of our way, you local-tax-school losers!’ Shouts of ‘Push ’em back!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Push ’em back!’ came welling up from behind.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Just as I was getting close to the intersection, slipping past the knots of students that were blocking my way, the order ‘Forward march!’ was issued in a strong, sharp voice, and the normal school students calmly began moving forward.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The question of who would go first, which had been the point of contention in the melee, had obviously been settled, and the middle school had given way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The normal school, I was told, qualified as the higher-ranking institution.The victory celebration was a very simple ceremony.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The local brigade commander read a congratulatory message, and then the Governor read one; the crowd shouted out a couple of ceremonial banzais, and that was all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They said that there would be an entertainment program in the afternoon, so in the meantime I went home and started writing a letter to Kiyo, which had been on my mind ever since I’d read hers.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She had asked me to write her more details about my life here, so I would have to try to give her as thorough an account as possible.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I actually took out some paper and sat down to write, though, there was so much to tell her that I had no idea where to begin.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I could write about this, but it would be a bother; I could write about that, but it would be a bore.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I racked my brains trying to come up with something that I could get down on paper smoothly without too much aggravation and that would be of interest to her, but I couldn’t think of any topics that filled the bill.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I rubbed my inkstone, dipped the tip of my brush in the ink, and stared at the blank sheet of paper; then I stared at the paper, wet my brush, and rubbed the inkstone again.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After repeating this same routine over and over, in the same way, I finally arrived at the conclusion that there was no way I could compose a letter, and put away my inkstone.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
What a lot of bother it is to write a letter!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It would have been a lot simpler just to go to Tokyo and tell her everything in person.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It wasn’t as if I didn’t care about how worried Kiyo was, but writing her the kind of letter she wanted would be more excruciating than going on a three-week fast.I flung my brush and paper aside, sprawled out on the floor, and lay there gazing out at the garden with my head resting on my arm.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I was still concerned about Kiyo.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It occurred to me that even though we were separated by such a great distance now, as long as I continued to worry about how she was getting on, she would surely realize my true feelings.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And as long as she was aware of them, there was no need for me to send anything like a letter.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
If I didn’t send one she’d probably assume that everything was all right.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You could do without sending a letter until something really big happened – a death, say, or an illness.The garden was a level patch of ground about twenty feet square, with nothing special in the way of plantings.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There was a single mandarin orange tree, so tall that its top rose above the garden wall and served as a kind of landmark for the house.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I always liked to gaze at this tree when I came home.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"For someone who had never been out of Tokyo before, the sight of the fruit hanging on the tree was a truly novel one.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As they ripened, the green oranges would no doubt be turning to a golden color; that, I was sure, would be beautiful to see.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Some of them were starting to change color already.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"According to the landlady, they were exceptionally juicy and delicious.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"She’d told me that I could help myself when they were ready to eat, and I was already looking forward to the time when I’d be able to enjoy a few each day.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In another three weeks there ought to be plenty of them; surely, I thought, I wouldn’t be leaving here before then.While I was lying there thinking about those oranges, the Porcupine suddenly turned up.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Today being the day of the victory celebration, he said, he’d decided that the two of us ought to indulge in a little feast, so he had gone out and bought some beef; with this, he pulled a package wrapped in a bamboo sheath out of the sleeve of his kimono and tossed it on the floor beside me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since I was still being subjected to the sweet potato and tofu treatment at home, and the noodle shop and dumpling shop had been placed strictly off limits as well, this was a welcome treat indeed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I went off to borrow a pan and some sugar from the landlady, and we started cooking right away.As the Porcupine was stuffing his face with beef, he asked me if I knew that Redshirt was a regular customer of a certain geisha.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Of course I do,’ I said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘She’s one of the ones that were at the farewell banquet, right?’ Yes, that was her, he replied, and complimented me for having been sharp enough to figure it out when he himself hadn’t gotten wind of it until just now.‘Just look at the guy,’ he said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘Every other word that comes out of his mouth is “character” or “spiritual amusements” – and then he goes and takes up with some geisha on the sly.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He makes me sick.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It wouldn’t be so bad if he was ready to accept what other people do for fun, but no – all you have to do is step into a noodle shop or a dumpling shop and he has the Principal warn you about setting a bad example … ’‘Yeah,’ I told him, ‘I guess that hiring a geisha is a spiritual amusement as far as that joker’s concerned, but tempura and dumplings are materialistic ones.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If it’s so spiritual, why doesn’t he flaunt it a little more?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How could he have pulled a stunt like that – getting up and running away as soon as he sees that geisha of his coming in the room?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He thinks he can keep pulling the wool over our eyes forever.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That’s what really gets me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And then when somebody attacks him he just says “I don’t know what you’re talking about,’ or tries to bamboozle you by spouting some nonsense about Russian literature, or haiku being the big brother of modern poetry.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He’s not even a man at all, he’s just a big sissy.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He must be a reincarnation of one of those old-time palace lady’s maids that specialized in all kinds of intrigue.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Or maybe his old man was one of those boys that plied their trade in the shadows over by the shrine in Yushima … ’‘Huh?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Boys in the shadows in Yushima?’‘Well, they weren’t exactly what you’d call manly, if you know what I mean … Hey, that piece isn’t cooked yet, don’t eat it or you’ll end up with a tapeworm!’‘Really?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Oh, it’s probably all right.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway, they say that Redshirt sneaks out to the hot spring to see that geisha at a house called Kado-ya.’‘Kado-ya?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You mean that inn?’‘It’s an inn, but it also has a restaurant.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
So the best way to put him on the spot would be to catch him in the act when he’s going in there with the geisha and give him a good tongue-lashing.’‘Catch him in the act?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
How?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
In a stakeout?’‘That’s right.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
You know the inn called Masu-ya that’s right across from Kado-ya?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, I can rent one of the second-floor rooms on the front side, poke a little hole in one of the paper screens, and keep a lookout.’‘Do you think he’ll actually come along while you’re looking?’‘I think so.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Of course, one night won’t be enough.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’ll have to be ready to give it a good two weeks or so.’‘That’ll be exhausting!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I remember when my old man died, I stayed up with him every night for a week, and when it was all over I felt like I was in a daze.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It really took a lot out of me.’‘A little fatigue won’t hurt me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It wouldn’t be doing Japan any favors to let a rogue like him keep running loose; I’m going to make myself an agent of divine retribution.’‘Sounds great!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
If you do go through with it I’ll help you out.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Are you going to start watching tonight?’‘Not tonight.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I haven’t talked to the people at Masu-ya yet.’‘Well, when do you plan to start, then?’‘Soon enough.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway I’ll let you know, so I hope you’ll lend a hand when the time comes.’‘Fine, I’ll be ready to help any time.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’m not much good at hatching schemes, but when it comes to a fight I’m pretty handy.’While the Porcupine and I were working out the details of the scheme, the landlady appeared at the door.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Mr Hotta,’ she announced, ‘one of the boys from the school is here and he’d like to talk to you, na moshi.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He says that he went to your home but since you were out he thought you might be here and came over to see, na moshi.’ She knelt politely in the doorway, awaiting the Porcupine’s reply.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘All right,’ he said, and went out to the front entrance.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
When he came back he reported that the student had come to invite him to go along to the entertainment portion of the victory celebration.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After hearing that there was going to be a troupe of dancers from Kōchi doing some kind of special dance that you hardly ever get a chance to see, he was all for going and urged me to go too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had seen plenty of dances in Tokyo; there was a big festival every year at the local shrine with people dancing on floats that were pulled around the neighborhood, so I knew about the Salt Gatherers’ Dance and all the rest.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had no interest in seeing a bunch of hicks from Kōchi making fools of themselves, but since the Porcupine had made a point of inviting me I figured that I might as well go anyway.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The boy who had come to invite him, it turned out, was none other than that brother of Redshirt’s.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Kind of odd that it should be him, of all people!The vast stretch of sky above the parade ground had come alive with countless pennants and banners fluttering from the tips of long poles that had been set up all over the place, which reminded me of the scene at the sumo tournament at Ekō-in or the big Buddhist memorial services at the Honmon Temple in Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There were also flags flying on a network of ropes which had been strung up overhead, so many of them that it seemed as if they must have borrowed one from every country in the world.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At the eastern corner a temporary stage had been set up for that Kōchi dance, whatever it was.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"About sixty yards to the right of the stage there was an exhibition of flower arrangements, surrounded by screens made of reed blinds.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Everybody was oohing and aahing at these, but it was completely worthless as far as I was concerned.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you’re going to get so excited about a bunch of twisted shrubs or bamboo, you might as well feel proud about having a hunchbacked lover or a lame husband while you’re at it.On the opposite side of the grounds from the stage they were busy shooting off fireworks.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As one of these burst it released a balloon with the words NIPPON BANZAI printed on it, which drifted over the pine trees by the castle and then fell inside the barracks compound.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Next there was a popping sound and a black dumpling arched across the autumn sky and then burst open right above my head.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Streamers of bluish smoke shot out like the ribs of a parasol and lazily melted away in the air.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Then came another balloon.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This one was red and said ARMY AND NAVY BANZAI in white letters.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Tossed about by the wind, it floated off over the hot spring toward Aioi village.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Maybe it came back to earth inside the grounds of the goddess of mercy’s temple.The crowd was much bigger now than it had been for the morning ceremony.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Looking at the swarming throng, I had to marvel that even a country town could be so full of people.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Most of them didn’t look particularly clever, but only a fool could take such sheer numbers of people lightly.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"By and by, that something-or-other dance from Kōchi, which was supposed to be so impressive, got under way.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had figured that it would be an ordinary dance, something along the lines of the Fujima or one of the other usual styles, but my guess was way off.Up on the stage were three rows of ten men each, all of them with impressive-looking headbands knotted at the back and kimono skirts tied in with cords at the knees.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What really shocked me, though, was that they were all carrying naked swords.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There was only about a foot and a half of space between the rows, and no more than that much distance between the dancers in each row.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
A single dancer stood off by himself at the edge of the stage.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This loner was also wearing a kimono skirt, but he hadn’t invested in a headband, and instead of carrying a sword he had a drum – the same kind they use in the Chinese lion dance – hanging from a strap around his neck.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He got things started with a sluggish shout of ‘Yaah!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Haah!’ and a strange chant accompanied by a ba-da-boom, ba-da-boom rhythm on the drum.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The tune was eerie, not like anything else I had ever heard; if you imagine something that sounded like a cross between a comical New Year’s minstrel song and a mournful Buddhist pilgrim’s chant, you wouldn’t be too far off.The song went along at an extremely loose, relaxed pace, as shapeless as a blob of jelly on a summer day, but at least the drummer was marking off each phrase in the flow of sound with a ba-da-boom, so you could pick up some kind of a rhythm.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The dancers were flashing their swords in time to this rhythm, with such speed and precision that just watching them was enough to make you break out in a cold sweat.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Only a foot and a half away on each side, as well as behind, was a live human being – and each of them was twirling his own naked sword around in exactly the same way, so unless they all moved with just the right timing somebody would end up getting hurt by one of his fellow dancers.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It wouldn’t have been so dangerous if they were simply standing in place while they waved their swords up and down and backward and forward, but all thirty of them also had to keep in step as they stamped their feet and turned to the side or wheeled around full circle or dipped their knees at the same time.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If the dancer next to you was just a second too fast, or a second too slow, your nose might come flying right off – or you might slice off your neighbor’s head.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Each sword was swinging freely within its own space, but that space was limited to a column about eighteen inches square, and it had to be wielded in the exact same direction at the exact same speed as the swords in front and behind and to the right and left.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This was a revelation – ordinary dances like the Salt Gatherers and the Gateway Door simply couldn’t compare.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It takes tremendous skill, I was told; learning the technique of synchronizing your movements like that was no easy thing.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"People said that the hardest job of all, though, was being in charge of the funny song and the ba-da-boom.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Everything that the thirty dancers did – their footwork, the way they waved their swords and twisted their hips – it all depended entirely on one thing, the rhythm set by this ba-da-boom man.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Strangely enough this guy appeared to be the most relaxed person on the stage, belting out his yaahs and haahs whenever he pleased, but actually it was a tremendously heavy responsibility and he had to give it everything he’d got.As the Porcupine and I were standing there awestruck, totally absorbed in the performance, a huge roar suddenly went up about fifty yards away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The throngs of people who had been calmly circulating among the various attractions now broke off toward the sides in massive waves.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
No sooner had we heard somebody yell ‘It’s a fight!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It’s a fight!’ than Redshirt’s little brother came cutting through the forest of sleeves and shouted ‘They’re fighting again, sir!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The middle school students are taking their revenge on the normal school for this morning – they’ve just started a battle to settle things once and for all!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You’d better come right away!’ Then he melted back into the crowd.‘What, they’re at it again?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Nothing but trouble, those brats!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Enough is enough!’ The Porcupine was off in a flash, dodging through the waves of people that were fleeing the scene.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He must have decided that he couldn’t just stand idly by and let the melee go on.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had no intention of running away either, of course, and I followed close on his heels.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"By the time we got to the spot, the fight was already going full blast.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There must have been about fifty or sixty students from the normal school, and a group about a third bigger from the middle school.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The normal school boys were still in their uniforms, but most of the kids from the middle school had changed into kimono after the ceremony so it was easy to tell the two sides apart.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But since they were all mixed in together, coming to grips and breaking off in ever-changing patterns, I had no idea how to go about getting them separated, or where to start.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Porcupine stood there for a couple of seconds surveying the fracas with an oh-no kind of look, but then turned to me and said ‘No choice now.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
We wouldn’t want the police to see this.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Let’s get in there and break it up!’ Without bothering to reply, I plunged right in at the point where the fighting looked fiercest.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Stop, stop!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
You’re a disgrace to your school!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Cut it out, I tell you!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"!’ Hollering at the top of my lungs, I tried to weave along what seemed to be the front line, but it was no easy feat.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"By the time I had worked my way a couple of yards in, I was hopelessly stuck.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Right in front of me one of the bigger normal school kids was grappling with a middle school kid of fifteen or sixteen.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘When I say stop, I mean stop!’ I yelled, and grabbed the normal school kid by the shoulder to try and tear him away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At the same moment, though, somebody tripped me from below.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Caught off balance, I lost my grip on the kid’s shoulder and tumbled to one side.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Somebody jumped on my back with a pair of hard shoes.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I sprang back up on my hands and knees, throwing the guy off and sending him bouncing down to the right.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Back on my feet, I could see the Porcupine about twenty feet away, hemmed in by swarms of students, shouting ‘Stop it!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Stop this fighting right now!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
!’ as his big body was being pushed to and fro in the swirling mob.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘Hey!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It’s no use!’ I yelled, but there was no response.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Maybe he couldn’t hear.All of a sudden a rock came whizzing in and hit me smack on the cheekbone, followed right away by somebody coming up from behind and whacking me across the back with a stick.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I could hear a voice screaming ‘Hit him!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Hit him!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What’s a teacher doing getting mixed up in this?’ Somebody else chimed in: ‘There are two of them, a big guy and a little one.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Pelt ’em with rocks!’ ‘You stupid hicks,’ I bellowed.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘Who the hell do you think you are?’ Then I wound up and gave a normal school student standing nearby a sock in the face.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Another rock came whistling in; this one brushed right past the side of my head and flew off behind me.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I couldn’t see what had become of the Porcupine.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
No choice now.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I first waded in I was trying to break up the fight, but now that I was getting whacked and having rocks thrown at me, I’d be damned if I was going to cut and run like some kind of ninny.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘Who do you think you’re dealing with?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I may be a little guy, but I learned my stuff in Tokyo, where the real fighters come from!’ With that battle cry I charged in like a madman, bashing people and getting bashed back, until I heard somebody shout ‘Police!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It’s the police!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Let’s get out of here!’ Up to this point it had been so hard to move in the crush of bodies that I felt like I was wading in some kind of sticky paste, but all of a sudden things eased up and before I knew it everybody, friend and foe alike, was rushing for the exits.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They may have been hicks, but when it came to beating a retreat they were real experts.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even a professional like General Kuropatkin could have learned a thing or two from this crew.Wondering what had happened to the Porcupine, I looked around and saw him up ahead wiping his nose, his kimono jacket with his family crest embroidered on it in shreds.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Somebody had punched him in the nose, he told me, and it had been bleeding heavily.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now it was bright red and all swollen, a really horrible sight.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I was in a less formal kimono, so even though it was splattered with mud it wasn’t as much of a loss as the Porcupine’s jacket.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I had an awful stinging pain in my cheek, though, and according to the Porcupine it was bleeding quite a bit.A force of fifteen or sixteen policemen had arrived on the scene, but since the students had taken off in the opposite direction, the only people who got caught were the Porcupine and me.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After we identified ourselves and gave them a full account of the incident, they told us that we’d better go down to the police station.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There we gave a deposition in the presence of the chief; then we headed home.11When I woke up the next morning, my whole body ached unbearably; it must have been because I’d been out of practice as a fighter for too long.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As I lay there in bed, thinking to myself that I couldn’t do much boasting about my fighting abilities now, the landlady brought in the Shikoku News and left it by my pillow.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I didn’t even really feel up to taking a look at a paper, but, I thought to myself, I wouldn’t be much of a man if I let a little thing like this get the better of me, so I forced myself over onto my stomach and started reading.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I turned to the second page, I was flabbergasted.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There was an article on last night’s fight, but that was no surprise.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The real shocker was the report that ‘two teachers from the middle school, a certain Mr Hotta and a certain impertinent party who had recently been hired from Tokyo, not only precipitated the altercation by inciting the innocent students but also assumed direction of the fray and even went so far as to engage in acts of unprovoked and unrestrained violence against the normal school students.’ It went on to provide the following commentary:Our prefectural middle school’s reputation for superior quality and model conduct has long made it the object of envy throughout the land, but the thoughtless acts of this puerile twosome have blemished the good name of our school and brought dishonor upon the entire community.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Under these circumstances, we feel it our duty to call the responsible parties to account with all due vigor.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"We are confident, however, that before we take matters into our own hands the competent authorities will adopt appropriate punitive measures with regard to the two malefactors and ensure that they will never again be afforded the opportunity to participate in educational activities.Every single letter of this diatribe had been printed with a little black dot next to it for emphasis, as if they had been trying to give the page acupuncture treatment.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
With a cry of ‘Eat shit!’ I sprang out of bed.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Incredibly, as soon as I did so, the awful pain that I’d been feeling in every joint of my body suddenly eased so much that it already seemed to be a thing of the past.I crumpled the newspaper into a ball and flung it out into the garden.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I still felt so furious, though, that I went out and picked it up again and then stuffed it down the toilet.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Newspapers print all kinds of outrageous lies.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you’ve ever wondered where to find the biggest blowhards in the world, well, a newspaper is the place.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Here they were giving people their version of a story that I should have been giving myself.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
And then to call me ‘a certain impertinent party who had recently been hired from Tokyo’ – who the hell did they think they were?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Is there anybody in the world who goes by the name of ‘a certain party,’ impertinent or otherwise?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Use your head – no matter what else you could say about me, at least I have a perfectly good name, and if you want to see it, I’ll be glad to show you my complete family tree, going all the way back to Minamoto no Mitsunaka …As I was washing my face, I suddenly felt a pain in my cheek.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I asked the landlady to lend me a mirror, and when she brought it, she asked if I had read the paper yet.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I told her that I had, and then I’d stuffed it down the toilet, so if she wanted it she’d have to fish it out herself.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Astonished, she walked off.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I looked at my face in the mirror, the bruises from last night were still there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No matter what else you could say about my face, it matters a lot to me; to end up with that face covered in bruises and on top of that to be reduced to the level of a nameless ‘certain impertinent party’ – it was all too much.If I’d let that newspaper intimidate me and hid out at home all day I’d never have been able to live it down, so as soon as I finished breakfast I dashed out the door and got to school before anybody else.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As the other teachers arrived, each of them broke into a smile when they saw my face.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What was so funny, I thought to myself – it’s not as if it was any of you guys that created this face for me in the first place.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
By and by the Hanger-on turned up.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘That was quite an exploit last night – those bruises, I suppose, are your badges of honor?’ he sneered.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Maybe this was his way of getting back at me for the beating he took at the farewell party.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘Never mind about me,’ I told him, ‘you just run along and lick your brush,’ to which he replied ‘Well, now, I do beg you pardon, but then it must be terribly painful, I fear.’ ‘Painful or not, it’s my face,’ I hollered.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘What business is it of yours?’ He went and sat down at his desk, but he kept staring at me and smirking as he whispered something to the history teacher sitting next to him.The Porcupine arrived before long, too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
His nose was purple and swollen and looked like it would start oozing pus if you stuck it with something.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Maybe it was just vanity on my part, but I couldn’t help thinking that he seemed to have taken a much worse beating than I had.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The two of us had our desks right next to each other; not only did we look like two sorry peas in a pod, but unfortunately our desks faced straight toward the faculty room door.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
That pair of faces had to be a pretty wondrous sight.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Any time one of the other teachers had nothing better to do, his gaze would drift in our direction.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘How awful!’ was what they all said, but I’m sure they were really thinking ‘What a pair of idiots!’ If not, why would they all be whispering and giggling the way they were?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I walked into my classroom, I was greeted with a round of applause, plus two or three banzais.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Whether this was a display of high spirits or they were just being wise guys was hard to tell.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Amid all the fuss, the one person who acted just the same as usual was Redshirt.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘What a terrible mishap,’ he said when he came over to us, and then offered what amounted to a semi-apology: ‘I feel so sorry for both of you.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’ve discussed that article in the newspaper with the Principal, and we’ve made an official request for a retraction, so there’s nothing to worry about.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since the whole affair started with my own brother’s invitation to Mr Hotta, I can’t tell you how badly I feel about it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"At any rate I’m absolutely determined to do whatever I can to make things right, so I hope you won’t hold this against me.’ During the third period the Principal emerged from his office and commented, with a somewhat worried look, that the newspaper article had certainly created a problem, and he hoped that the consequences would not be too drastic.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Personally, I wasn’t worried in the least.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If they wanted to dismiss me over this, all I had to do was turn in my resignation first.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But for me to give in when I hadn’t done anything wrong would just make those blowhards at the newspaper feel even more pleased with themselves.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The right thing to do, I was sure, was for me to dig in and stay at my post, and force the newspaper to print a retraction.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’d even been thinking about stopping in at the newspaper office on my way home to state my case, but once I heard that the school had already asked them to withdraw their claims, I decided not to do it.In between classes and other business the Porcupine and I managed to give the Principal and Redshirt a fairly complete picture of the way things had really happened.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They both sounded sympathetic, and took the view that the people at the newspaper must have made a point of printing such a story because they bore some kind of grudge against the school.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Redshirt then went around the faculty room talking to each of our colleagues in turn, defending our conduct and making it sound like it had all been his fault, since his brother was the one who asked the Porcupine to attend in the first place.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Everybody agreed that the newspaper was the guilty party; it was inexcusable, and the two of us were the real victims of the incident.As I was leaving for the day, the Porcupine pulled me aside and warned me that there was something fishy going on with Redshirt; if we didn’t watch out, he added, we could be in for it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘I know, he’s been fishy all along,’ I replied, ‘he didn’t just get that way overnight.’ According to the Porcupine, though, I was missing the point: making sure that we were invited to the celebration and then getting us mixed up in the fight was all part of a scheme.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"That was something I hadn’t thought about before, but now it was perfectly clear.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Porcupine might have looked like a ruffian all right, but you had to admire the way he used his head.‘First he gets us into the fight, then he goes straight to the newspaper and gets them to write that story.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The man’s a real snake, I tell you.’‘So the article was his work, too?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Incredible!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But would the newspaper people really just go along with whatever he told them?’‘Why not?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Nothing to it if he’s got a friend on the staff.’‘But does he?’‘Even if he doesn’t, nothing to it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"They’ll print anything, any kind of lie, as long as you look like you know what you’re talking about and tell it with a straight face.’‘This is terrible!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If it was all a trap that Redshirt set for us, it could end up getting us fired!’‘If things go wrong, it could be all over for us.’‘Well, if that’s the case, I’ll just turn in my resignation tomorrow and go back to Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I wouldn’t stay in this dump if they begged me … ’‘That wouldn’t be a problem as far as Redshirt’s concerned.’‘Hmm, true enough.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What could we do that would be a problem?’‘Rogues like him are always careful not to leave any tracks no matter what they’re up to, so he won’t be easy to catch.’‘What a bind.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
We’d just end up looking like we were making false accusations.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
No fun at all!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Isn’t there any justice in this world?’‘Anyway, let’s wait a couple of days and see what happens.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Then if worst comes to worst, we’ll just have to catch him at the hot spring, I guess.’‘And not try to do anything about the newspaper?’‘That’s right.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
We’ll go on the attack ourselves and hit him in his weak spot instead.’‘Sounds good.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’m hopeless when it comes to strategy, so I’ll leave that all up to you.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But whenever you need me, I’ll be ready for anything.’With that, the Porcupine and I went our own ways.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If Redshirt had really done what the Porcupine suspected he had, he was definitely a first-class scoundrel.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Not the kind of guy you could hope to prevail over in a battle of wits.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Nothing but brute force would do.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It’s no wonder wars keep breaking out all over the world.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even on the individual level, when you come right down to it, brute force is what counts.I could hardly wait for the newspaper to appear the next morning, but when it did, there was nothing in it in the way of a retraction, let alone a more accurate account of the incident.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked the Badger about it at school, he said that there would probably be something appearing the following day.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And there was – a retraction, printed in the smallest possible type.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No attempt to print a corrected version, of course.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I tried taking my case to him again, but this time he said that there was no further recourse to be had.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Behind that badger face of his and all that preening in his frock coat, this Principal had surprisingly little clout.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
He couldn’t even get a country newspaper to apologize for printing an article that was full of lies!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This was too much for me to take, so I announced that I would go and lodge a protest with the editor myself, but the Badger, in tones that would have been better suited to a Buddhist priest sermonizing on the spirit of renunciation, told me that this wouldn’t do.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘If you complain to them, they’ll just print another article raking you over the coals.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The fact is, when they write something about you in the paper there isn’t a thing you can do about it, regardless of whether it’s true or false.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You just have to live with it.’ If that’s really the way things are, we’d all be a lot better off if the newspapers were driven out of business, and the sooner the better.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Getting written about in a newspaper is like getting bitten by a snapping turtle – once it latches onto you, it won’t let go.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"This is what I now realized, thanks to my talk with the Badger.One afternoon about three days later, the Porcupine paid me a visit.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Seething with indignation, he announced that the time had finally come and he was going to put his plan into action.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In that case, I said, I was ready to join him right away in the league of the righteous, but the Porcupine shook his head and advised me to stay out of it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I asked him why, he answered by asking me whether I had been called in by the Principal and ordered to submit a letter of resignation.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No, I said, and how about you?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He then reported that earlier that day he had been informed, in the Principal’s office, that although it was indeed regrettable, due to unavoidable circumstances the school would be obliged to ask him to relinquish his position.‘What kind of justice is that?’ I said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘That Badger must have been beating his chest so hard that he knocked himself senseless.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The two of us went to the victory celebration together.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And we watched those dancers flash their swords together, didn’t we?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And we tried to stop that fight together, didn’t we?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If he’s asking you to resign, he should ask me, too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It’s only fair.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Why do these country schools have to be so damned unreasonable?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It’s driving me crazy!’‘Redshirt’s behind the whole thing.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After everything that’s gone on up till now there isn’t enough room in this school for both of us, but he figures that he can keep you on because you won’t be any threat to him.’‘It’s not big enough for Redshirt and me, either.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He’s got some nerve thinking I’m not a threat.’‘Well, he must think that you’re so simple-minded he can always keep you around and bamboozle you any time he needs to.’‘That’s even worse!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There’s no conceivable way this school could be big enough for him and me!’‘And besides, have you noticed that the replacement they hired for Koga hasn’t arrived yet for some reason?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If they got rid of both of us now, they wouldn’t have enough people to cover all of the classes, so … ’‘So they think they can just keep me around as a fill-in, huh?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Damn them!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"No way I’ll let them get away with that!’When I went to school the next morning I headed straight to the Principal’s office.‘I want to know why you didn’t ask for my resignation.’‘What?’ The Badger looked stunned.‘What kind of sense does it make to ask Hotta to resign, but not me?’‘The school does have its reasons … ’‘Well, those reasons are all wrong.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If I don’t have to resign, then there shouldn’t be any need for Hotta to, either.’‘It’s all rather difficult to explain, but … Hotta’s leaving is an unavoidable circumstance, but I see no need for you to follow suit.’Leave it to the sly old Badger to sit there cool as a cucumber while he spouted this load of hogwash.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There was nothing else I could do now, so I let him have it.‘Well, in that case, I’m resigning too.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You may think that if you make Hotta quit I’ll just take it in my stride and stay on, but I couldn’t let him down like that.’‘That won’t do.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you left along with Hotta, the school would have nobody to teach the math classes.’‘That’s your problem, not mine.’‘You mustn’t be so selfish.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You need to give a little thought to the good of the school – and besides, if you leave after less than a month on the job, how is it going to look on your record?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"You’d better think a little more about that, too.’‘Who cares about my record?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Doing what’s right is more important.’‘Well, I have to agree with that – in fact, I have to agree with everything you’ve said.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But please give a little consideration to what I have to say.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you insist on resigning, well, so be it, but I hope that you’ll at least stay on long enough for us to find somebody else.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway, please go home and think it over one more time.’There was nothing to think over – my reason for quitting was as clear as daylight – but watching the Badger’s face go pale and then bright red and then back again I couldn’t help feeling sorry for him, so I said I’d try thinking it over and took my leave.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I didn’t even bother talking to Redshirt.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If we were going to go after him at all, we might as well hit him with everything we had.When I filled the Porcupine in on my parley with the Principal, he said yes, that was pretty much what he expected the man would say, and added that I might as well hold off on resigning until the time was ripe, so that was what I did.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It seemed that he was actually a good deal shrewder than I was, so I was ready to leave all the decisions to him.The Porcupine finally handed in his resignation, bid his formal farewell to the assembled faculty, and took a room in the Minato-ya down by the harbor; but without letting anybody get wind of it he made his way back to the hot spring and holed up in a second-floor room on the front side of Masu-ya, poked a peephole in the paper window, and started keeping watch.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I was probably the only one who knew what he was doing.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If Redshirt was going to slip in across the street, it would have to be at night.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And it would have to be sometime after nine, since he might be noticed by somebody, even a student, if he came earlier in the evening.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"For the first two nights I kept lookout with the Porcupine until eleven, but there was no sign of him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The third night we watched until half past ten – still nothing doing.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Nothing makes you feel more foolish than walking back home in the middle of the night after another night of coming up empty-handed.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"By the fourth or fifth night old Mrs Hagino was starting to get concerned, and she warned me that it wasn’t a good thing for a married man to be spending his nights out on the town.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Of course her idea of being out on the town had nothing to do with what I was actually up to – serving as an agent of divine retribution.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Anyway, going back and forth like that for a full week without having anything to show for our stakeout was no fun.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Being the impulsive type, I have no problem with staying up all night working when I’m fired up about something, but the other side of the coin is that I can never manage to keep it up for very long.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Even as an agent of the Divine Retribution League, it was no different.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
By the sixth night I was getting a little tired of it; by the seventh I was thinking about calling it quits.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
This is where the Porcupine showed just how tenacious he was.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
From early in the evening all the way past midnight he kept his eye glued to that peephole and focused right on the gaslit doorway of the Kado-ya across the street.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"What really amazed me, though, was that when I went to visit him he would show me a detailed list of how many people had gone into Kado-ya that day, how many of them were spending the night there, how many were women, and other such statistics.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I’d say, ‘Looks like he isn’t coming, doesn’t it?’ there were times when he’d fold his arms, sigh a little, and reply ‘Well, I’m sure he’ll turn up sooner or later, but … ’ Poor fellow!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If Redshirt didn’t put in an appearance, the Porcupine’s divine mission could never be carried out.On the eighth night I left my place around seven, had a nice leisurely dip at the hot spring, and then picked up eight eggs from a shop to fortify myself against my old landlady’s sweet potato offensive.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"With four of the eggs stuck in each sleeve, my usual red towel slung over my shoulder, and my hands buried inside the front of my kimono, I went up the stairway to the second floor of Masu-ya.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I slid open the Porcupine’s door, I could sense right away that things were looking up; that fierce guardian-god-Idaten face of his had suddenly regained its old glow.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Up until then he had seemed a little glum; just being around him was enough to make me feel kind of depressed myself.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Once I saw his expression that night my own spirits began to rise too, and before he even had a chance to tell me anything I let out a whoop of joy.‘Around half past seven tonight that geisha Kosuzu went in the door.’‘With Redshirt?’‘Well, no.’‘Well, then, it’s no good, is it?’‘But there was another geisha with her … I just have a good feeling about this.’‘How come?’‘How come?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Well, you know what a sly fox he is.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"He might be sending the two geisha in first and planning to slip in later himself.’‘Hmm, could be.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It’s past nine already, isn’t it?’He pulled his nickel-plated pocket watch out from underneath his sash.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
‘Just twelve past nine.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Hey, better put out the lamp – if he sees two crew-cut silhouettes up here it might make him wonder.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Foxes are very suspicious, you know.’I blew out the lamp, which was sitting on a lacquer table.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The paper window was still lit faintly by the starry sky.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The moon wasn’t up yet.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The Porcupine and I kept our faces pressed against the window and held our breath.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
We could hear the chime of the wall clock downstairs as it struck nine thirty.‘I wonder if he’s really coming tonight.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If he doesn’t, I give up.’‘I’m staying right here till my money runs out.’‘How much have you got?’‘So far I’ve given them five sixty for eight nights.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’m paying by the night so I can take off any time.’‘Good thinking.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’ll bet the inn people are puzzled.’‘They don’t mind.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The real problem is I can never let up.’‘But you can sleep during the day, can’t you?’‘I do, but I can’t go out at all.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Being stuck in here all day is driving me crazy.’‘Divine retribution is no easy job.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But if we let him slip through the net now it would be no fun at all!’‘No, no, he’ll come tonight, for sure … Hey, look!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Look!’ These last words, delivered in a whisper, took my breath away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"A man in a black hat looked up at the gas lamp in front of Kado-ya, then vanished into the darkness.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Not him.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Uh-oh, I thought.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Soon the clock downstairs struck ten, as loud as it pleased.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
It didn’t look like this would be the big night after all.A hush was settling over the whole neighborhood.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"We could hear the sound of a drum from the red-light district, so clear it made you feel like you could almost reach out and grab it.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The moon stole up beyond the hills behind the hot spring, lighting up the street.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"And then, all of a sudden, we heard voices in the distance.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Since we couldn’t put our heads out the window, there was no way for us to see who it was, but they were evidently getting closer and closer.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
We could hear the clackety-clack of wooden sandals on the street.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Peering at an angle through the peephole, we could finally make out two shadowy figures coming into view.‘Now that we’ve got him out of the way, everything will be all right.’ There was no mistaking that voice: it was the Hanger-on.‘He was all bluster, no brainpower, so what could you expect?’ This was Redshirt.‘That other one is a real Tokyo character.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Still just a youngster, but he does like to talk tough … Charming, isn’t it!’‘Saying he doesn’t want a raise, and trying to turn in his resignation … He must be mentally unbalanced, I’m sure of it.’It was all I could do to keep myself from leaping straight down from the second floor and giving the two of them a good pounding right then and there.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Laughing out loud, they walked through the light of the gas lamp and on into Kado-ya.‘Hey!’‘Hey!’‘There they are!’‘Finally!’‘What a relief!’‘Did you hear that?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"“Just a youngster, but he likes to talk tough” … Son of a bitch!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
!’‘But I was the one who was in the way – absolutely outrageous!’The two of us would have to ambush them on their way home.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
But when would they be coming out?,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
The Porcupine went downstairs to tell the man at the desk that he might have some business to attend to very late that night and to make sure that the door would be left open for us.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Now that I think about it, we were pretty lucky that they let us out – for all they knew, we could have been burglars going to work!Lying in wait for Redshirt to come along had been hard enough, but keeping our eyes peeled for the moment he came back out was even harder.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"We couldn’t let ourselves doze off, and it was a pain keeping our faces pressed up against that opening in the window without a break; one way or another we couldn’t help feeling on edge the whole time.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I’d never had to do anything as hard in my entire life.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I tried to convince the Porcupine that we might as well march right into Kado-ya and catch them red-handed, but this idea was rejected outright: if we barged in now, he said, we’d either be taken for a couple of hoodlums and stopped in our tracks, or, if we managed to explain why we were there and demanded to see Redshirt, they’d be sure to tell us he wasn’t there or take us to the wrong room; and even if we somehow managed to get in without being noticed, we’d have no way of knowing which of the dozens of rooms to look for.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"There was nothing we could do but wait, boring as it was – and that’s just what we did, all the way until five o’clock the next morning.As soon as we saw the two of them coming out, the Porcupine and I set out after them.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The first train back to the castle town wouldn’t be leaving for a while yet, so they’d have to walk.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"From the edge of the hot spring village the road was lined with cedar trees for about a hundred yards, with rice paddies on either side.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"After that it ran along an embankment that passed through farmers’ fields with some thatched houses here and there, and continued on up toward the castle grounds.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Once we got out of the village we could overtake them anywhere we pleased.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"We decided that we’d try to catch them somewhere along the cedar avenue where there weren’t any houses around, and shadowed them at a distance that allowed us to keep them in sight most of the time.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As we passed the last of the village buildings we broke into a run, and came up behind them like a sudden wind-storm.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Dumbfounded, Redshirt turned around with no idea of what had hit him.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
We grabbed him by the shoulders and ordered them to halt.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Hanger was on the verge of panic and looked ready to make a run for it, so I wheeled around in front of him and cut off his line of escape.‘And just what was a man who occupies the position of Assistant Principal doing spending the night at Kado-ya?’ demanded the Porcupine, wasting no time in getting the inquest under way.‘Am I to understand that some regulation prohibits Assistant Principals from spending the night there?’ Redshirt’s tone was as polished as ever, but his face looked slightly pale.‘And why did somebody who is so conscientious that he insists that even noodle shops and dumpling shops should be avoided on moral grounds see fit to spend a night at an inn in the company of a geisha?’The Hanger was still on the lookout for an opportunity to run, so I stepped right in his way and yelled ‘What do you mean, “just a youngster, but he likes to talk tough?”’ right in his face.‘Oh, that wasn’t you I was talking about, oh no, not at all … ’ Of all the shameless attempts to talk his way out of it!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Just at that moment I noticed that my hands were still clutching tightly at my sleeves – when I came running up the road I had to grab them to keep the eggs I was carrying from knocking against each other.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"In a flash I stuck my hand in, pulled out two of them, and slammed them into the Hanger’s face with a righteous yell.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As they burst, the yolks began dripping down from the tip of his nose in a thick stream.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Apparently shocked out of his wits, he flopped down onto his butt with a wail, then shouted ‘Help!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Help!,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"!’ Of course I had bought those eggs for eating, and I hadn’t been keeping them in my sleeves to throw at anyone; in the heat of the moment, though, sheer rage had made me grab them and let the Hanger have it without even knowing what I was doing.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"But once I saw him sitting there miserably on his backside I realized that it had been just the right thing to do, so for good measure I pelted him with the rest of the eggs as well, screaming ‘You goddamned son of a bitch!’ as I let fly.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"His whole face was a mass of gooey yellow now.While I was giving the Hanger the egg treatment, the Porcupine and Redshirt were keeping their wrangle going full blast:‘What proof do you have that I spent the night there with a geisha?’‘I saw your favorite geisha going into Kado-ya yesterday evening with my own eyes.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If you think you can bluff your way out of this, forget it!’‘There’s no need to bluff about anything.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Yoshikawa and I stayed the night by ourselves.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Whether a geisha went in there or not, it has nothing to do with us.’‘Just SHUT UP!’ said the Porcupine, and socked him in the face.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Redshirt took a few tottering steps, then mumbled ‘This is unmitigated brutality!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Blindly resorting to brute force, with no sense of right and wrong – it’s inexcusable!’‘Don’t you tell me what’s inexcusable!’ The Porcupine gave him another whack.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘This is the only way to make a snake like you understand!’ he added for good measure, and went right on with the beating.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
While he was at it I kept myself busy pummeling the Hanger.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Finally the two of them knelt cowering at the foot of a cedar; maybe they were too worn out to move, maybe it was just that their heads were swimming, but anyway they weren’t even trying to escape.‘Had enough yet?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"If not, we’ll give you some more,’ the Porcupine shouted, and we began working them over again.‘Enough!’I turned to the Hanger: ‘And what about you?",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Had enough?’‘That’s enough, of course!’‘This is the just punishment you rogues deserve.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I hope you’ve learned your lesson and behave yourselves from now on.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"It doesn’t matter how slick your excuses are – what’s wrong is wrong, and you won’t get away with it!’ Neither of them made any reply to the Porcupine’s warning.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
Probably by this point they just didn’t feel up to saying anything.‘I’m not going to run and I’m not going to hide.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
If you want me for anything I’ll be at Minato-ya down by the waterfront till five o’clock this evening.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Go ahead and call in the police or anybody else if you want to.’‘I’m not running or hiding either,’ I added.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘I’ll be waiting with Hotta, so if you want to go to the police, go right ahead.’ With that, the two of us strode off.I got back to my place a little before seven and started packing right away.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The old lady, of course, was surprised, and asked me what I was doing.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘I’m going to Tokyo, ma’am, to fetch my wife,’ I told her, and, after settling the bill, I took the train down to the harbor and headed for Minato-ya.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Porcupine was in a second-floor room, asleep.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I sat right down to write out a letter of resignation, but I didn’t know what you were supposed to say so I simply wrote: ‘Due to personal circumstances, I hereby resign.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
I am returning to Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Your understanding is appreciated.’ Then I stuck it in an envelope, addressed it to the Principal, and mailed it off.The boat was scheduled to sail at six that evening.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Both of us, dead tired, fell into a deep sleep.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"By the time we woke up, it was two o’clock.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"We asked the maid if the police had been around, but apparently they hadn’t.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"‘So Redshirt and the Hanger didn’t lodge a complaint after all,’ we said, and burst out laughing.That evening the Porcupine and I left that accursed place behind us.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The more distance the boat put between us and the shore, the happier we felt.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
From Kobe we took an express train straight to Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When we arrived at Shimbashi Station, I felt like I had finally made it out of purgatory and back to the real world.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The Porcupine and I went our separate ways from there; I haven’t had a chance to see him again since.Oh, I almost forgot to say something about Kiyo.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"As soon as I set foot in Tokyo, I headed straight over to her place, suitcase and all, without even bothering to stop off at my old boardinghouse.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"When I dashed through the doorway yelling ‘Kiyo, I’m back!’ she got all teary and said ‘Botchan, oh my goodness!",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Back so soon!’ I was so overwhelmed with relief that I announced right then and there that I would never go out to the country again and that I was going to get a house for both of us in Tokyo.Not long afterward, through the good offices of an acquaintance of mine I got a job as an engineer on one of the streetcar lines.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The salary was twenty-five yen a month, and my rent was six.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Kiyo seemed perfectly satisfied with the house, even though it didn’t have a fine entryway, but this February the poor woman caught pneumonia and died.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"The day before she died she called me to her bedside and said ‘Botchan, for mercy’s sake, please let me be buried at your family’s temple when I die.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"I’ll be happy just lying there, waiting for you to come.’ And that’s why her grave is in Yōgen Temple in Kobinata.",Natsume Soseki,Botchan
"Sensei and II ALWAYS called him “Sensei.”1 I shall therefore refer to him simply as “Sensei,” and not by his real name.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It is not because I consider it more discreet, but it is because I find it more natural, that I do so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whenever the memory of him comes back to me now, I find that I think of him as “Sensei” still.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And with pen in hand, I cannot bring myself to write of him in any other way.It was at Kamakura, during the summer holidays, that I first met Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was then a very young student.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I went there at the insistence of a friend of mine, who had gone to Kamakura to swim.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We were not together for long.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It had taken me a few days to get together enough money to cover the necessary expenses, and it was only three days after my arrival that my friend received a telegram from home demanding his return.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His mother, the telegram explained, was ill. My friend, however, did not believe this.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For some time his parents had been trying to persuade him, much against his will, to marry a certain girl.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"According to our modern outlook, he was really too young to marry.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, he was not in the least fond of the girl.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was in order to avoid an unpleasant situation that instead of going home, as he normally would have done, he had gone to the resort near Tokyo to spend his holidays.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He showed me the telegram, and asked me what he should do.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not know what to tell him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was, however, clear that if his mother was truly ill, he should go home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And so he decided to leave after all.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I, who had taken so much trouble to join my friend, was left alone.There were many days left before the beginning of term, and I was free either to stay in Kamakura or to go home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I decided to stay.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My friend was from a wealthy family in the Central Provinces, and had no financial worries.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But being a young student, his standard of living was much the same as my own.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was therefore not obliged, when I found myself alone, to change my lodgings.My inn was in a rather out-of-the-way district of Kamakura, and if one wished to indulge in such fashionable pastimes as playing billiards and eating ice cream, one had to walk a long way across rice fields.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If one went by rickshaw, it cost twenty sen.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Remote as the district was, however, many rich families had built their villas there.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was quite near the sea also, which was convenient for swimmers such as myself.I walked to the sea every day, between thatched cottages that were old and smoke-blackened.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The beach was always crowded with men and women, and at times, the sea, like a public bath, would be covered with a mass of black heads.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I never ceased to wonder how so many city holiday-makers could squeeze themselves into so small a town.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Alone in this noisy and happy crowd, I managed to enjoy myself, dozing on the beach or splashing about in the water.It was in the midst of this confusion that I found Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In those days, there were two tea houses on the beach.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For no particular reason, I had come to patronize one of them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Unlike those people with their great villas in the Hase area who had their own bathing huts, we in our part of the beach were obliged to make use of these tea houses which served also as communal changing rooms.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In them the bathers would drink tea, rest, have their bathing suits rinsed, wash the salt from their bodies, and leave their hats and sunshades for safe-keeping.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I owned no bathing suit to change into, but I was afraid of being robbed, and so I regularly left my things in the tea house before going into the water.Sensei had just taken his clothes off and was about to go for a swim when I first laid eyes on him in the tea house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had already had my swim, and was letting the wind blow gently on my wet body.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Between us, there were numerous black heads moving about.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was in a relaxed frame of mind, and there was such a crowd on the beach that I should never have noticed him had he not been accompanied by a Westerner.The Westerner, with his extremely pale skin, had already attracted my attention when I approached the tea house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was standing with folded arms, facing the sea: carelessly thrown down on the stool by his side was a Japanese summer dress which he had been wearing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He had on him only a pair of drawers such as we were accustomed to wear.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I found this particularly strange.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Two days previously I had gone to Yuigahama, and sitting on top of a small dune close to the rear entrance of a Western-style hotel, I had whiled away the time watching the Westerners bathe.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"All of them had their torsos, arms, and thighs well-covered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The women especially seemed overly modest.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Most of them were wearing brightly colored rubber caps which could be seen bobbing conspicuously amongst the waves.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After having observed such a scene, it was natural that I should think this Westerner, who stood so lightly clad in our midst, quite extraordinary.As I watched, he turned his head to the side and spoke a few words to a Japanese, who happened to be bending down to pick up a small towel which he had dropped on the sand.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The Japanese then tied the towel around his head, and immediately began to walk towards the sea.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This man was Sensei.From sheer curiosity, I stood and watched the two men walk side by side towards the sea.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They strode determinedly into the water, and making their way through the noisy crowd, finally reached a quieter and deeper part of the sea.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then they began to swim out, and did not stop until their heads had almost disappeared from my sight.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They turned around, and swam straight back to the beach.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At the tea house, they dried themselves without washing the salt off with fresh water from the well and, quickly donning their clothes, they walked away.After their departure, I sat down, and lighting a cigarette, I began idly to wonder about Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not help feeling that I had seen him somewhere before, but failed to recollect where or when I had met him.I was a bored young man then, and for lack of anything better to do, I went to the tea house the following day at exactly the same hour, hoping to see Sensei again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This time, he arrived without the Westerner, wearing a straw hat.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After carefully placing his spectacles on a nearby table and then tying his hand towel around his head, he once more walked quickly down the beach.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And when I saw him wading through the same noisy crowd, and then swim out all alone, I was suddenly overcome with the desire to follow him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I splashed through the shallow water until I was far enough out, and then began to swim towards Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Contrary to my expectation, however, he made his way back to the beach in a sort of arc, rather than in a straight line.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was further disappointed when I returned, dripping wet, to the tea house: he had already dressed, and was on his way out.I saw Sensei again the next day, when I went to the beach at the same hour; and again on the following day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But no opportunity arose for a conversation, or even a casual greeting, between us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His attitude, besides, seemed somewhat unsociable.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He would arrive punctually at the usual hour, and depart as punctually after his swim.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was always aloof, and no matter how gay the crowd around him might be, he seemed totally indifferent to his surroundings.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The Westerner, with whom he had first come, never showed himself again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei was always alone.One day, however, after his usual swim, Sensei was about to put on his summer dress which he had left on the bench, when he noticed that the dress, for some reason, was covered with sand.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As he was shaking his dress, I saw his spectacles, which had been lying beneath it, fall to the ground.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He seemed not to miss them until he had finished tying his belt.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When he began suddenly to look for them, I approached, and bending down, I picked up his spectacles from under the bench.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Thank you,” he said, as I handed them to him.The next day, I followed Sensei into the sea, and swam after him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When we had gone more than a couple of hundred yards out, Sensei turned and spoke to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The sea stretched, wide and blue, all around us, and there seemed to be no one near us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The bright sun shone on the water and the mountains, as far as the eye could see.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My whole body seemed to be filled with a sense of freedom and joy, and I splashed about wildly in the sea.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei had stopped moving, and was floating quietly on his back.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I then imitated him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The dazzling blue of the sky beat against my face, and I felt as though little, bright darts were being thrown into my eyes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I cried out, “What fun this is!”After a while, Sensei moved to an upright position, and said, “Shall we go back?” I, who was young and hardy, wanted very much to stay.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I answered willingly enough, “Yes, let us go back.” And we returned to the shore together.That was the beginning of our friendship.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I did not yet know where Sensei lived.It was, I think, on the afternoon of the third day following our swim together that Sensei, when we met at the tea house, suddenly asked me, “Do you intend to stay in Kamakura long?” I had really no idea how much longer I would be in Kamakura, so I said, “I don’t know.” I then saw that Sensei was grinning, and I suddenly became embarrassed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not help blurting out, “And you, Sensei?” It was then that I began to call him “Sensei.”That evening, I visited Sensei at his lodgings.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was not staying at an ordinary inn, but had his rooms in a mansion-like building within the grounds of a large temple.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I saw that he had no ties of any kind with the other people staying there.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He smiled wryly at the way I persisted in addressing him as “Sensei,” and I found myself explaining that it was my habit to so address my elders.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I asked him about the Westerner, and he told me that his friend was no longer in Kamakura.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His friend, I was told, was somewhat eccentric.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He spoke to me of other things concerning the Westerner too, and then remarked that it was strange that he, who had so few acquaintances among his fellow Japanese, should have become intimate with a foreigner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally, before leaving, I said to Sensei that I felt I had met him somewhere before but that I could not remember where or when.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was young, and as I said this, I hoped, and indeed expected, that he would confess to the same feeling.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But after pondering awhile, Sensei said to me, “I cannot remember ever having met you before.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Are you not mistaken?” And I was filled with a new and deep sense of disappointment.I returned to Tokyo at the end of the month.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei had left the resort long before me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As we were taking leave of each other, I had asked him, “Would it be all right if I visited you at your home now and then?” And he had answered quite simply, “Yes, of course.” I had been under the impression that we were intimate friends, and had somehow expected a warmer reply.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My self-confidence, I remember, was rather shaken then.Often, during my association with Sensei, I was disappointed in this way.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, Sensei seemed to know that I had been hurt, and sometimes, he seemed not to know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But no matter how often I experienced such trifling disappointments, I never felt any desire to part from Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, each time I suffered a rebuff, I wished more than ever to push our friendship further.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought that with greater intimacy, I would perhaps find in him those things that I looked for.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was very young, it is true.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I think that I would not have behaved quite so simply towards others.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not understand then why it was that I should behave thus towards Sensei only.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But now, when Sensei is dead, I am beginning to understand.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was not that Sensei disliked me at first.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His curt and cold ways were not designed to express his dislike of me, but they were meant rather as a warning to me that I would not want him as a friend.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was because he despised himself that he refused to accept openheartedly the intimacy of others.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I feel great pity for him.I intended of course to visit Sensei when I returned to Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There were still two weeks left before the beginning of lectures, and I thought I would visit him during that time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A few days after my return, however, I began to feel less inclined to do so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The atmosphere of the great city affected me a great deal, bringing back memories.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Every time I saw a student in the streets, I found myself awaiting the coming of the new academic year with a feeling of hope and tense excitement.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For a while, I forgot all about Sensei.A month or so after the start of lectures, I became more relaxed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At the same time, I began to walk about the streets discontentedly, and to look around my room with a feeling that something was lacking in my life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I began to think of Sensei, and I found that I wanted to see him again.The first time I went to his home, Sensei was out.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I remember that I went again the following Sunday.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was a lovely day, and the sky was so blue that I was filled with a sense of wellbeing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Again, he was not at home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In Kamakura, Sensei had told me that he spent most of his time at home: indeed, he had even told me that he disliked to go out.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Remembering this, I felt an unreasonable resentment at having twice failed to find him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I therefore hesitated in the front hall, staring at the maid who had informed me of her master’s absence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She seemed to remember that I had called before and left my card.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Asking me to wait, she went away.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A lady then appeared, whom I took to be the mistress of the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She was beautiful.Very courteously, she told me of Sensei’s whereabouts.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I learned that every month, on the same day, it was Sensei’s custom to take flowers to a certain grave in the cemetery at Zoshigaya.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“He left here,” said the lady regretfully, “hardly more than ten minutes ago.” I thanked her and left.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before I had gone very far towards the busier part of town, I decided that it would be a pleasant walk to Zoshigaya.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, I might meet Sensei, I thought.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I turned around and started to walk in the direction of Zoshigaya.From the left side of a field I entered the cemetery and proceeded along a broad avenue bordered on each side by maple trees.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was a tea house at the end of the avenue, and I saw coming out of it someone that looked like Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I walked towards him until I could see the sunlight reflected on the frame of his spectacles.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then, suddenly, I cried out aloud, “Sensei!” Sensei stopped, and saw me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“How in the world .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
?” he said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then again, “How in the world .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"?” His words, repeated, seemed to have a strange echo-like effect in the stillness of the afternoon.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not know what to say.“Did you follow me?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
How .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"?”He seemed quite relaxed as he stood there, and his voice was calm.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But there was on his face a strangely clouded expression.I explained to Sensei how I happened to be there.“Did my wife tell you whose grave I was visiting?”“Oh, no.”“Well, I suppose there was no reason why she should.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After all, she met you today for the first time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No, of course not, there was no need for her to tell you.”At last, he appeared satisfied.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I could not understand the reason for his remarks.We walked between tombstones on our way out.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Next to those with inscriptions such as “Isabella So-and-so .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".” and “Login, Servant of God,” were those with Buddhist inscriptions such as “All living things bear within themselves the essence of Buddha.” There was one tombstone, I remember, on which was written, “Minister Plenipotentiary So-and-so.” I stopped before one that was particularly small, and pointing at the three Chinese characters on it, I asked Sensei, “How does one read that?”“I presume they are meant to be read as ‘Andrew’,” said Sensei, smiling stiffly.Sensei did not seem to find the way in which different customs were reflected in the tombstones amusing or ironical, as I did.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Silently, he listened to me for a while as I chattered on, pointing to this tombstone and that.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But finally he turned to me and said, “You have never thought seriously of the reality of death, have you?” I became silent.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei said no more.Towards the end of the cemetery, there stood a gingko tree, so large that it almost hid the sky from view.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei looked up at the tree and said, “In a little while, it will be beautiful here.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The tree will be a mass of yellow, and the ground will be buried beneath a golden carpet of fallen leaves.” Every month, I learned, Sensei made a point of walking by the tree at least once.Not far from us in the cemetery, a man was leveling off a piece of rough ground.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He stopped, and, resting on his hoe, he watched us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Turning to our left, we soon reached the main road.Having no particular destination in mind, I continued to walk along with Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei was less talkative than usual.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I felt no acute embarrassment, however, and I strolled unconcernedly by his side.“Are you going straight home?”“Yes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There is nothing else I particularly want to do now.”Silently, we walked downhill towards the south.Again I broke the silence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Is your family burial ground there?” I asked.“No.”“Whose grave is it, then?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Some relation of yours perhaps?”“No.”Sensei would say no more about it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I decided to mention the matter no further.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But after he had walked a hundred yards or so, Sensei suddenly reopened the conversation.“A friend of mine happens to be buried there.”“And you visit his grave every month?”“Yes.”Sensei told me no more that day.After that day, I began to visit Sensei at regular intervals.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I found him always at home.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And the more I visited Sensei, the more eager I became to see him again.Despite this, however, there was no great change in Sensei’s manner towards me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He was always quiet.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At times, he seemed so quiet that I thought him rather lonely.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt from the start his strangely unapproachable quality.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Yet, at the same time, there was within me an irresistible desire to become close to Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Perhaps I was the only one who felt thus towards him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Some might say that I was being foolish and naïve.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But even now, I feel a certain pride and happiness in the fact that my intuitive fondness for Sensei was later shown to have not been in vain.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A man capable of love, or I should say rather a man who was by nature incapable of not loving; but a man who could not wholeheartedly accept the love of another—such a one was Sensei.As I have already said, Sensei was always quiet.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, he seemed to be at peace with himself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But sometimes, I would notice a shadow cross his face.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, like the shadow of a bird outside the window, it would quickly disappear.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The first time I noticed it was at the cemetery at Zoshigaya, when I suddenly spoke to him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remember that I felt then, though only for a passing moment, a strange weight on my heart.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Soon after, the memory of that moment faded away.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One evening, however, towards the end of the Indian summer, it was unexpectedly brought back to my mind.As I was talking to Sensei, I happened for some reason to think of the great gingko tree that he had pointed out to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I remembered that his monthly visit to the grave was only three days away.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Thinking that it would fall on the day when my lectures ended at noon, and that I should be relatively free, I turned to Sensei and said:“Sensei, I wonder if the gingko tree at Zoshigaya has lost all its leaves by now?”“I doubt that it will be quite bare yet.”Sensei was watching me carefully.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said quickly:“May I accompany you, when you next visit the grave?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I should like to take a walk around there with you.”“I go to visit a grave, not for a walk, you know.”“But surely, we can go for a walk at the same time?”Sensei was silent for a while, then said, “Believe me, visiting the grave is for me a truly serious matter.” He seemed quite determined to distinguish between his pilgrimage to the grave and an ordinary walk.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I began to wonder whether he was making this excuse because he did not wish me to accompany him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I remember that I thought him oddly childish at the time.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I became more forward.“Well, then,” I said, “please allow me to accompany you as a fellow visitor to the grave.” I really did think Sensei’s attitude rather unreasonable.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A shadow crossed his brow, and his eyes shone strangely.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I cannot say whether it was annoyance, or dislike, or fear, that I saw in his expression.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But whatever it was, there was beneath it, I felt, a gnawing anxiety.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I was suddenly reminded of the way he looked that day at Zoshigaya when I called to him.“I cannot tell you why,” Sensei said to me, “but for a very good reason I wish to go to that grave alone.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Even my wife, you see, has never come with me.”I thought his behavior very strange.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I did not visit Sensei with the purpose of studying him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I decided to think no more about it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My attitude towards Sensei then is one of those things that I remember with a certain amount of pride.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Because of it, I believe, we were able to become so close to each other.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Had I been curious in an impersonal and analytical way, the bond between us would surely not have lasted.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was, of course, not aware of all this at the time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I hate to think what might have happened had I acted differently.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Even in his relationship with me, he was in constant dread of being coldly analyzed.I began to visit Sensei two or even three times a month.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One day, seeing that my visits were becoming more and more frequent, Sensei suddenly said to me:“Why should you want to spend so much time with a person like me?”“Why?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I don’t think there’s any particular reason .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Am I a nuisance, sir?”“I did not say that.”Indeed, he never seemed to regard me as a nuisance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was aware that the number of his acquaintances was rather limited.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As for those who had been in the same class with him at the university, I knew there were no more than two or three in Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, I would find at his house students who were from the same part of the country as Sensei, but it seemed to me that none of them were as close to him as I was.“I am a lonely man,” Sensei said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“And so I am glad that you come to see me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I am also a melancholy man, and so I asked you why you should wish to visit me so often.”“But why should you want to ask?”Sensei did not answer me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Instead, he looked at me, and said, “How old are you?”The conversation seemed to me to be rather purposeless.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Without pursuing it any further, I left.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Four days later, I was back again at his house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As soon as Sensei appeared, he began to laugh.“You’re back again,” he said.“Yes, I’m back,” I said, and I laughed with him.Had anyone else spoken in such a way to me, I think I should have been annoyed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"With Sensei, it was somehow different.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Far from being annoyed, I was happy.“I am a lonely man,” he said again that evening.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“And is it not possible that you are also a lonely person?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I am an older man, and I can live with my loneliness, quietly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You are young, and it must be difficult to accept your loneliness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You must sometimes want to fight it.”“But I am not at all lonely.”“Youth is the loneliest time of all.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Otherwise why should you come so often to my house?”Sensei continued: “But surely, when you are with me, you cannot rid yourself of your loneliness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I have not it in me to help you forget it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You will have to look elsewhere for the consolation you seek.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And soon, you will find that you no longer want to visit me.”As he said this, Sensei smiled sadly.Fortunately, Sensei was mistaken.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Inexperienced as I was then, I could not even understand the obvious significance of Sensei’s remarks.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I continued to see Sensei as before.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And before long, I found myself dining at his house occasionally.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As a result, I was obliged to speak to Sensei’s wife also.Like any other young man, I was not indifferent to women.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But being young and my experience of the world being what it was, I had so far not had any opportunity to form any friendship with a woman.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My interest in women had been limited to glances thrown at those who were completely unknown to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The first time I met Sensei’s wife in the front hall, I thought her beautiful.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And each time I saw her after that, I was similarly impressed by her beauty.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I felt, at first, that there was nothing of any interest that I could speak to her about.Rather than to say that she possessed no special qualities worthy of note, it would perhaps be more correct to say that she had never been given an opportunity to show them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My feeling was always that she was little more than a necessary part of Sensei’s household.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And it would seem that she regarded me, albeit with goodwill, simply as a student who came to talk with her husband.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Apart from Sensei, there was no bond of sympathy between us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My memory of the early part of our acquaintance, then, consists of nothing more than the impression of her beauty.One evening, I was invited by Sensei to join him in a cup of saké.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei’s wife came to serve us.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei seemed more cheerful than usual.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Offering his empty cup, he said to his wife, “You have some too.”“No, I don’t really .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
",” she began to say, then accepted the cup somewhat unwillingly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Frowning slightly, she raised to her lips the cup that I had half-filled for her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A conversation then followed between her and Sensei.“This is so unusual,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“You hardly ever ask me to drink saké.”“That’s because you don’t like saké.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But it does you good to drink occasionally.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
This will cheer you up.”“It certainly will not.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It makes me feel uncomfortable.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You, however, seem to have become quite gay.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And you haven’t had much.”“Yes, sometimes, it seems to cheer me up.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But, you know, it doesn’t always.”“And how do you feel tonight?”“Oh, tonight, I feel good.”“Then from now on, you should drink—just a little—every evening.”“That, I cannot do.”“Please do.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then you will stop being melancholy.”Apart from them, there was only the maid in the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Every time I went there, the house seemed to be absolutely quiet.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I never heard the sound of laughter there, and sometimes it seemed almost as if Sensei and I were the only people in it.“It would be so nice if we had children,” Sensei’s wife said to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Yes, wouldn’t it?” I answered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I could feel no real sympathy for her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At my age, children seemed an unnecessary nuisance.“Would you like it if we adopted a child?”“An adopted child?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Oh, no,” she said, and looked at me.“But we’ll never have one of our own, you know,” said Sensei.Sensei’s wife was silent.“Why not?” I asked.“Divine punishment,” Sensei answered, and laughed rather loudly.Sensei and his wife seemed to me to be a fond enough couple.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Not being a member of the family, I could not of course know how they truly felt towards each other.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But whenever I was with Sensei, and if he happened to want anything, instead of the maid, he would call his wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
(The lady’s name was Shizu.),Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Shizu,” Sensei would call, turning towards the door.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The tone of his voice, when he did so, always sounded gentle to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And her manner, when she appeared, seemed always willing and obedient.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And whenever they kindly invited me to dinner, and I had occasion to see them together at the table, my pleasant impression of their feelings towards each other would be confirmed.Sometimes, Sensei would take his wife to a concert or to the theatre.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Also, I remember that they went away together for a week’s holiday at least two or three times during the period I knew them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I still have with me a postcard that they sent me from Hakone.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I remember that the time they went to Nikko, I received from them a letter with a maple leaf enclosed.There was, however, one incident that marred my general impression of their married life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One day, I was standing as usual in their front hall, and was about to announce myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I heard voices coming from the living room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"An argument, rather than an ordinary conversation, seemed to be taking place.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The living-room was immediately adjoining the front hall, and I could hear well enough to know that it was a quarrel, and that one of the voices, which was raised now and then, belonged to Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The other voice was lower in tone than Sensei’s, and I could not be sure whose it was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I was almost certain that it was his wife’s.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She seemed to be weeping.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I stood there for a short while, not knowing what to do.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then I left, and returned to my lodgings.A dreadful anxiety filled my heart.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I tried to read, but found that I could not concentrate.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"An hour later, I heard Sensei calling from beneath my window.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Surprised, I looked out.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Let us go for a walk,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I looked at my watch, and saw that it was past eight o’clock.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had not bothered to take off my dress trousers when I returned.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I left my room immediately.That evening, Sensei and I drank beer together.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei was not a heavy drinker.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was not the sort of person to go on drinking if a reasonable amount did not have any cheering effect on him.“It just won’t work this evening,” Sensei said, with a wry smile.“Can’t you feel gay?” I asked, feeling sorry for him.I could not forget what had happened earlier that day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It bothered me terribly, like a fish bone in my throat.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not decide whether I should tell him about it or not.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei noticed my anxiety.“There seems to be something the matter with you this evening,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“To tell you the truth, I am not my usual self either.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Have you noticed?”I could not say anything in reply.“As a matter of fact, I quarreled with my wife a short while ago.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I allowed myself to become stupidly excited.”“But why did you .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"?” I began, but could not bring myself to say “quarrel.”“You see, sometimes my wife misunderstands me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And when I tell her so, she refuses to listen.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That is why today, for instance, I unwittingly lost my temper.”“In what way does she misunderstand you, Sensei?”Sensei did not answer my question.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He said:“If I were the sort of person she thinks I am, I would not suffer so.”How he suffered, my imagination then could not conceive.On our way back, we walked for a while in silence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then he began to speak again.“I did a terrible thing.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I should not have left home in such a fit of temper.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My wife must be worried about me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When we think about it, women are unfortunate creatures.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My wife, for instance, has no one in this world but me to depend upon.”He was silent for a while.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He seemed not to expect a reply from me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He then continued:“Of course, my last remark would lead one to suppose that the husband is self-reliant.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Which is laughable.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Tell me, how do I appear to you?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Do you think me a strong or a weak person?”“Somewhere in-between,” I answered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My reply, it would seem, was a little unexpected.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He became silent again, and we continued our walk.The road leading to Sensei’s house passed very near my own lodgings.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When we reached the corner of my street and I was about to bid him goodnight, I began to feel that it would somehow be heartless to leave him then and there.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Shall I walk you home?” I said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He made a quick, negative gesture with his hand.“You had better go home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It’s late.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I must go home too.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
For my wife’s sake .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.”“For my wife’s sake .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.”: these last words of Sensei’s strangely warmed my heart.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Because of them, I was able to enjoy an untroubled sleep that night.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And for a long time after, those words stayed with me: “For my wife’s sake .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.”I knew then that the disagreement which had occurred between them was not very serious.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I continued to visit them regularly, and I could see that it had been an exceptional occurrence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, he took me into his confidence one day and said:“In all the world, I know only one woman.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No woman, but my wife, moves me as a woman.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And my wife regards me as the only man for her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From this point of view, we should be the happiest of couples.”I cannot remember clearly why it was that he took the trouble of telling me this.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I do remember that his manner at the time was serious, and that he was calm.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What struck me then as being odd was his last remark: “.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
we should be the happiest of couples.” Why “should be”?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Why did he not say, “We are the happiest of couples”?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Was Sensei indeed happy?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not but wonder.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But very soon, I brushed aside my doubts concerning Sensei’s happiness.One day, for the first time since I met her, I had a good talk with Sensei’s wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had previously asked Sensei to discuss a book with me, and he had kindly invited me to visit him that day for that purpose.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I arrived at nine o’clock in the morning, as arranged.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I found Sensei out.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A friend of his, I learned, was sailing from Yokohama, and Sensei had gone to see him off at Shimbashi.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In those days, the boat train to Yokohama customarily left Shimbashi at eight-thirty in the morning.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei had left a message for me, however, saying that he would be back soon and that I should wait.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"While waiting for Sensei, therefore, I talked to his wife.By then, I was already a university student.2 I felt that I had become more mature since my first visit to Sensei’s house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had also become quite familiar with Sensei’s wife.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Therefore, when I found myself alone with her, I did not feel at all ill at ease.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We talked of this and that.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I should not have remembered the conversation at all, had it not been for the fact that in the course of it, we talked of one matter which was of particular interest to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before I go on to say what this was, I should perhaps explain a few things about Sensei.Sensei was a graduate of the university.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I knew this from the first.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But it was only after my return to Tokyo from Kamakura that I discovered he had no particular employment.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wondered at the time how he managed to support himself.Sensei lived in complete obscurity.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Apart from myself, there was no one who knew of Sensei’s scholarship or his ideas.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I often remarked to him that this was a great pity.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But he would pay no attention to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“There is no sense,” he once said to me, “in such a person as myself expressing his thoughts in public.” This remark struck me as being too modest, and I wondered whether it did not spring from a contempt of the outside world.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, he was sometimes not above saying rather unkind things about those of his classmates who had since their graduation made names for themselves.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This apparent inconsistency in his attitude, which was at once modest and contemptuous, I quite frankly pointed out to him once.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not do this in a rebellious spirit.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I simply regretted the fact that the world was indifferent to Sensei, whom I admired so much.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In a very quiet voice, Sensei answered me: “You see, there is nothing we can do about it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I do not have the right to expect anything from the world.” There was, as he said this, an expression on his face which affected me profoundly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did not know whether what I saw was despair, regret, or grief.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had not the courage to say any more.As Sensei’s wife and I sat and talked, our conversation drifted naturally to the subject of Sensei.“Why does Sensei,” I asked, “not go out into the world and find himself some position that is worthy of his talents, instead of spending all his time studying and thinking at home?”“There is no hope of that, I am afraid.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He would hate it.”“I suppose he sees that it would be a vain thing to do?”“Being a woman, I wouldn’t know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I doubt that that is the reason.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am sure he would like to do something, really.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But somehow, he can’t.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am very sorry for him.”“But he is in good health, is he not?”“Certainly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He is perfectly well.”“Well then, why doesn’t he do something?”“I wish I knew.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Do you think that I would be worrying so much, if I did?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I feel so sorry for him.”Her tone of voice held a great deal of sympathy.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Her lips, however, were smiling slightly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As far as our outward manner was concerned, I must have seemed the more anxious of the two.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I sat there, silent and serious.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She looked up, as though she suddenly remembered something, and said:“You know, when he was young, he wasn’t at all the sort of person he is now.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He was quite different.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He has changed so much.”“When was he different?” I asked.“Oh, in his student days.”“Then you knew him when he was a student?”Sensei’s wife blushed a little.She was a Tokyo woman.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Both Sensei and she herself had told me this before.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Her father had actually come from some such place as Tottori, while her mother had been born in Ichigaya, when Tokyo was still known as Yedo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For this reason, she once said, half-jokingly, “I am, as a matter of fact, of mixed blood.” Sensei, on the other hand, was from the province of Niigata.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was clear to me, therefore, that her place of origin could not explain how she had come to know Sensei when he was a student.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But seeing the blush on her face when I touched on the subject of their youthful acquaintance, I asked no more about it.In the years between my first meeting with Sensei and his death, I came to know much of what he thought and felt, but concerning the circumstances of his marriage, he told me almost nothing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was inclined, sometimes, to regard this reserve on Sensei’s part in a favorable light.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After all, I would tell myself, he quite naturally would consider it indiscreet and in bad taste to speak of his early courtship to a youth such as myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But sometimes, I was inclined to regard his reserve unfavorably.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I liked then to think that his reluctance to discuss such a matter was due to timidity born of the conventions of a generation ago.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought myself more free, in this respect, and more open-minded, than either Sensei or his wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whatever my thoughts regarding Sensei’s reserve might have been, they were, of course, only speculations.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And there was always, at the back of my speculations, the assumption that their marriage had been the flowering of a beautiful romance.My assumption was not proved entirely wrong.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I was imagining only a small part of the truth that lay behind their love story.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not know that there had been in Sensei’s life a frightening tragedy, inseparable from his love for his wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Nor did his own wife know how wretched this tragedy had made him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
To this day she does not know.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei died keeping his secret from her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before he could destroy his wife’s happiness, he destroyed himself.I shall not speak here of the tragedy in Sensei’s life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And, as I have said before, Sensei and his wife told me almost nothing of their courtship, which had come into being as though for the sake of the tragedy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei’s wife said little about it for modesty’s sake, but there was a far profounder reason for Sensei’s silence.One day, during the flower-viewing season, Sensei and I went to Ueno.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I remember that day well.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"While we were strolling there, we happened to see a good-looking couple walking close together, beneath the flowering trees.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
They seemed unusually fond of each other.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The place being rather public, they, rather than the flowers, seemed to be the object of interest for many people.“They look like a newly married couple,” said Sensei.“They seem to be pretty fond of each other, don’t they?” I said, in an amused tone of voice.There was not even a trace of a smile on Sensei’s face.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He began deliberately to walk away from the couple.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He then said to me:“Have you ever been in love?”I said no.“Don’t you want to be in love?”I said nothing in reply.“It isn’t that you don’t want to fall in love, is it?”“No.”“You made fun of that couple, didn’t you?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But actually, you sounded to me like a person who is dissatisfied because he has not yet been able to fall in love, though he wants to.”“Did I sound like that?”“Yes, you did.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
A person who has been in love himself would have been more tolerant and would have felt warmer towards the couple.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But—but do you know that there is guilt also in loving?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wonder if you understand me.”I was surprised, and said nothing.There was a large crowd around us, and every face in it looked happy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We had little opportunity to talk until we reached the woods, where there were no flowers and no people.“Is there really guilt in loving?” I asked suddenly.“Yes, surely,” Sensei said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He seemed as certain as he did before.“Why?”“You will soon find out.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In fact, you ought to know already.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Your heart has been made restless by love for quite some time now.”Vainly, I searched my heart for an answer.“But there is no one whom you might call the object of my love,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I have not hidden anything from you, Sensei.”“You are restless because your love has no object.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If you could fall in love with some particular person, you wouldn’t be so restless.”“But I am not so restless now.”“Did you not come to me because you felt there was something lacking?”“Yes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But my going to you was not the same thing as wanting to fall in love.”“But it was a step in your life towards love.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The friendship that you sought in me is in reality a preparation for the love that you will seek in a woman.”“I think that the two things are totally different.”“No, they are not.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But being the kind of man that I am, I cannot help you to rid your heart of that feeling of want.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, peculiar circumstances have made me even more useless than I might have been as a friend.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am truly very sorry.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That you will eventually go elsewhere for consolation is a fact I must accept.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, I even hope that you will.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".”I began to feel a strange kind of sorrow.“Sensei, if you really think that I shall drift away from you, there is nothing I can do about it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But such a thought has so far never crossed my mind.”Sensei did not listen to me.“But you must be careful,” he continued.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“You must remember that there is guilt in loving.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You may not derive much satisfaction from our friendship, but at least, there is no danger in it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Do you know what it feels like to be tied down by long, black hair?”I could imagine what Sensei meant, but inexperienced as I was, his words held no reality for me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Also, I had no notion of what Sensei meant by “guilt.” I felt a little discontented.“Sensei, please explain more clearly what you mean by ‘guilt.’ Otherwise, please let us not discuss this matter again, until I have myself found out what this ‘guilt’ is.”“It was wrong of me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had intended to make you aware of certain truths.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Instead, I have only succeeded in irritating you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was wrong of me.”Sensei and I walked slowly in the direction of Uguisudani, past the back of the museum.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Through the gaps in the fencing, we could see dwarf bamboos growing thickly in one part of the garden.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was about the scene an air of deep, secluded peace.“Do you know why I go every month to my friend’s grave in Zoshigaya?”Sensei’s question was totally unexpected.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He should, of course, have known that I did not know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I remained silent.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then, as though realizing what he had just said, Sensei went on:“I have said the wrong thing again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was trying to explain my earlier remarks because I thought they had irritated you.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But in trying to explain, I find that I have upset you once more.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Let us forget the whole matter.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But remember, there is guilt in loving.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And remember too, that in loving, there is something sacred.”I was more mystified than ever by Sensei’s talk.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I never heard him mention the word “love” again.Being young, I was rather inclined to become blindly devoted to a single cause.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At least, so I must have appeared to Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I considered conversation with Sensei more profitable than lectures at the university.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I valued Sensei’s opinions more than I did those of my professors.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei, who went his solitary way without saying very much, seemed to me to be a greater man than those famous professors who lectured to me from their platforms.“You must try to be more sober in your opinions about me,” Sensei once said to me.“But I am being sober,” I cried, confidently.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei, however, refused to take me seriously.“You are like a man in a fever.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When that fever passes, your enthusiasm will turn to disgust.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Your present opinion of me makes me unhappy enough.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But when I think of the disillusionment that is to come, I feel even greater sorrow.”“Do you think me so fickle?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Do you find me so untrustworthy?”“I am simply sorry for you.”“I deserve your sympathy, but not your trust.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Is that what you mean, Sensei?”He seemed vexed as he turned his face towards the garden.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Not long before, the garden had been full of camellias.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But now, the flowers, which had brightened the scenery with their rich, red color, were all gone.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It had been Sensei’s custom to look out from his room, and gaze at them.“It is not you in particular that I distrust, but the whole of humanity.”I could hear the cry of a goldfish vendor from the lane on the other side of the hedge.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There was no other sound.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The house was some distance from the main road, and we seemed to be surrounded by a complete calm.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"All was quiet, as usual, inside the house itself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I knew that Sensei’s wife was in the next room, busy at her sewing or some such work.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I knew also that she could hear what we were saying.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I momentarily forgot this, as I said:“Then you have no trust in your wife either?”Sensei looked a little uneasy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He avoided giving a direct answer to my question.“I don’t even trust myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And not trusting myself, I can hardly trust others.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There is nothing that I can do, except curse my own soul.”“Surely, Sensei, you think too seriously about these things.”“It is not a matter of what I think.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It is what I have done that has led me to feel the way I do.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At first, my own act shocked me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then, I was terribly afraid.”I wanted to pursue the conversation, but we were interrupted by the voice of Sensei’s wife, calling him from behind the door.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“What is it?” Sensei said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Can you come here a minute?” his wife said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had hardly begun to wonder why Sensei had been called to the next room when he returned.“At any rate,” he continued, “don’t put too much trust in me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You will learn to regret it if you do.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And if you ever allow yourself to feel betrayed, you will then find yourself being cruelly vindictive.”“What do you mean?”“The memory that you once sat at my feet will begin to haunt you, and in bitterness and shame, you will want to degrade me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I do not want your admiration now, because I do not want your insults in the future.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I bear with my loneliness now, in order to avoid greater loneliness in the years ahead.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You see, loneliness is the price we have to pay for being born in this modern age, so full of freedom, independence, and our own egotistical selves.”I could not think of anything to say.After that day, I used to wonder each time I saw Sensei’s wife whether Sensei’s attitude towards her reflected his inner thoughts, and if so, whether she could be satisfied with her condition.But I could discern neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction in her manner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, I was not close enough to her to know what her real feelings were.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I rarely saw her away from Sensei: besides, in my presence, her behavior was always that of the conventional hostess.I wondered also why Sensei felt the way he did towards mankind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Was it, I would ask myself, the result of a coldly impartial scrutiny of his own inner self and the contemporary world around him?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And if one were as naturally reflective, intelligent, and as removed from the world as Sensei, would one inevitably reach the same conclusions?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Such tentative explanations, however, which suggested themselves to my mind, did not completely satisfy me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei’s opinions, it seemed to me, were not merely the result of cloistered reflection.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They were not, as it were, like the skeleton of a stone house, which has been gutted by fire.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
They were more alive than that.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, Sensei, as I saw him, was primarily a thinker.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But his thoughts, I felt, were based firmly on a strong sense of reality.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And this sense of reality did not come so much from observation of the experience of others removed from himself, as from his own experience.Such speculations, however, added little to my understanding of Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei, as a matter of fact, had already given me reason to believe that his thoughts were indeed forced upon him by the nature of his experience.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But he had hinted only, and his hints were to me like a vast threatening cloud hanging over my head, vague in outline and yet frightening.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The fear within me, nevertheless, was very real.I tried to explain to myself Sensei’s view of life by imagining a love affair in his youth—between Sensei and his wife, of course—involving violent passion at first, and perhaps regret later.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Such an explanation, I liked to think, would more or less take into account the association in Sensei’s mind of guilt with love.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei, however, had admitted to me that he was still in love with his wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The cause of Sensei’s pessimism, then, could not reasonably be traced to their relationship with each other.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It seemed that Sensei’s misanthropic views which he had expressed to me applied to the modern world in general, but not to his wife.The memory of the grave in the cemetery at Zoshigaya would come back to me from time to time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That this grave was of some profound significance to Sensei, I knew well.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I, who had come so close to Sensei and yet understood him so little, regarded the grave as something that held, in a sense, a fragment of his life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But whatever was buried in it was dead for me, and I knew that I would not find in it the key to Sensei’s heart.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, the grave stood like some monstrous thing, forever separating us.Meanwhile, it so happened that I had another occasion to have a conversation with Sensei’s wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was at the time of the year when the days grow shorter and there is everywhere a feeling of restless activity.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There was already a chill in the air.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"During the previous week, there had been a series of burglaries in Sensei’s neighborhood.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
They had all taken place in the early hours of the evening.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Nothing of great value had been stolen.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The houses had been broken into nevertheless, and Sensei’s wife was uneasy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Unfortunately, Sensei was obliged to be away from the house one evening.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A friend of his from the same part of the country as himself, and who was a doctor in some provincial hospital, had come up to Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei and two or three others were taking him out to dinner that evening.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Explaining the situation, Sensei asked me to stay with his wife until he returned.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I agreed to do so willingly.It was dusk when I reached the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei, who was a punctilious man, had already left.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“My husband did not want to be late.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He left only a minute ago,” said Sensei’s wife, as she led me to her husband’s study.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The study was furnished partly in the Western style, with a desk and some chairs.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A great number of books, bound beautifully in leather, gleamed through the glass panes of the book cases.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei’s wife bade me sit down on a cushion by the brazier.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“There are plenty of books here for you to read, if you so wish,” she said, and left the room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not help feeling ill at ease, rather like a chance visitor waiting for the master of the house to return.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sitting stiffly, I began to smoke.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could hear Sensei’s wife talking to the maid in the morning room, which was along the same corridor as the study.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The study, however, was at the end, and was therefore in a very quiet part of the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When Sensei’s wife stopped talking, I was surrounded by complete silence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Expecting the burglar to appear any minute, I sat very still, and listened for any suspicious sound that might break the silence.About half an hour later, Sensei’s wife appeared at the door, “Well!” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She seemed both surprised and amused when she saw me sitting there, stiff and serious like a strange guest.“You seem very uncomfortable,” she said.“Oh, no, I am not at all uncomfortable.”“Then you must be bored.”“Oh, no.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am all tense, waiting for the burglar, and so I am not at all bored.”She remained standing, with a European teacup in her hand, and laughed.“This room, being in a rather remote corner of the house, is not an ideal place for a watchman,” I said.“Well, in that case, come along to the morning room, if you wish.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I brought you some tea, thinking you must be bored.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You can have it there.”I followed Sensei’s wife out of the study.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"An iron kettle was singing on a handsome, long brazier in the morning room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There, I was given black tea and cakes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei’s wife refused to drink tea herself, saying that she would not be able to go to sleep if she did.“Does Sensei often go out to dinner parties?” I asked.“No, hardly ever.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It seems that of late, he has become less inclined than ever to see people.”Sensei’s wife seemed to betray no anxiety as she said this, so I became more bold.“You must then be the only person Sensei likes to be with,” I said.“Certainly not.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am like all the rest in his eyes.”“That is not true,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“And you know very well that that is not true.”“What do you mean?”“Well, I think that he has tired of the company of others because of his fondness for you.”“I see that higher education has made you adept at empty rationalization.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You might as well have reasoned that he cannot be fond of me, since I am a part of the world that he dislikes.”“True.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But in this case, I am right.”“Let us not argue.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You men certainly will argue about anything, and with such obvious pleasure too.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I have often wondered how it is that you men can, without becoming bored, forever exchange empty saké cups with one another.”Her words, I thought, were a little harsh.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But they did not seem offensive to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei’s wife was not so modern a woman as to take pride and pleasure in being able to display her mental prowess.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She valued far more that thing which lies buried in the bottom of one’s heart.I wanted to say more.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I was afraid of being taken for one of these argumentative men, and so I became silent.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Would you like more tea?” Sensei’s wife said to me, tactfully, when she saw that I was staring foolishly into the empty teacup.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I quickly handed the cup over to her.“How many?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
One lump?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Two lumps?”She had picked up a lump of sugar with a strange instrument, and was looking at me when she said this.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She was not exactly trying to be ingratiating, but she was undoubtedly trying to eradicate the effect on me of her harsh words by her charming manner.I drank tea silently.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remained silent even when I had finished the cup.“You seem to have become very quiet,” she said.“Well, I don’t want to be scolded for being argumentative,” I answered.“Come, come,” she said.We began to talk again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The conversation naturally wandered back to the subject of Sensei.“Won’t you allow me to go on with what I was saying?” I said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“It might have seemed to you that I was indulging in meaningless rationalization, but, truly, I was being sincere.”“Well, all right.”“You don’t think that Sensei’s life would be the same without you, do you now?”“I certainly wouldn’t know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Why don’t you ask Sensei?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It would be more sensible to ask him.”“Please, I am being serious.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You mustn’t try to evade my question so frivolously.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wish you would be more honest with me.”“But I am being honest.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I honestly don’t know.”“Then let me ask you a question that you, rather than Sensei, will be in a position to answer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You are very fond of Sensei, aren’t you?”“Surely, there’s no need to ask a question like that.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And with such a grave face, too!”“You mean that the answer is obvious?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That it’s a silly question to ask?”“More or less.”“Then what would happen to Sensei, if such a loyal companion as yourself were suddenly to leave him?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He seems to take little enough pleasure in this world as it is.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What would he do without you?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I don’t want to know how he would answer this question.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I want to know what you honestly think.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Would he be happy, do you think, or unhappy?”“Actually, I know the answer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
(Though Sensei might not think that I do.),Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei would be far more unhappy without me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Why, he might not even want to go on living, without me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It may seem very conceited of me, but I do really believe that I am able to make him as happy as is humanly possible.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I believe that no one else would be able to make him as happy as I can.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Without this belief, I would not be as contented as I am.”“Such a conviction must surely be known to Sensei.”“That is another matter entirely.”“You still wish to maintain that Sensei dislikes you?”“Oh, no, I don’t think for a moment that I am disliked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There is no reason why I should be.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But you see, he seems to be rather weary of the world.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, it would be more correct to say of Sensei these days that he is weary of people.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And seeing that I am one of those creatures that inhabit this world, I can hardly hope to be regarded as an exception.”I began to understand Sensei’s wife better.I was deeply impressed by her capacity for sympathy and understanding.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What also impressed me was the fact that though her ways were not those of an old-fashioned Japanese woman, she had not succumbed to the then prevailing fashion of using “modern” words.I was a rather simple-minded young man; women, for example, were total strangers to the kind of world I knew or had experienced.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, being a man, I felt an instinctive yearning for women.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But the yearning in me was little more than a vague dream, hardly different from the yearning in one’s heart when one sees a lovely cloud in the spring sky.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Often, when I found myself face to face with a woman, my longing would suddenly disappear.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Instead of being drawn to the woman, I would feel a kind of repulsion.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Such, however, was not my reaction to Sensei’s wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did not even feel, when I was with her, that intellectual gulf which so often separates men from women.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, I soon forgot that she was a woman, and came to regard her as the one person with whom I could share my sincere and sympathetic interest in Sensei.“Do you remember,” I said, “that time when I asked you why Sensei did not go out into the world more, and you replied that he was not always so much of a recluse?”“Yes, I remember.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And really, he was not.”“Then what was he like?”“The kind of person you wish him to be, the kind of person I wish him to be .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There was hope and strength in him then.”“What caused him to change so suddenly?”“The change was not sudden.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It came gradually.”“And you were with him all the time that this change was taking place?”“Of course.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was his wife.”“Surely, then, you must know the cause of the change.”“Unfortunately, no.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am embarrassed to admit this, but no matter how much I think about it, I don’t seem to be able to find the answer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You have no idea how often I have begged him to tell me the reason for the change.”“What does he say, when you ask him?”“That there is nothing for him to tell, and that there is nothing for me to worry about.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He says that it was simply in his nature to change so.”I said nothing.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei’s wife also became silent.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Not a sound came from the maid’s room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I forgot all about the burglar.“You don’t think that I am to blame, do you?” she asked me suddenly.“No,” I said.“Please tell me what you really think.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The thought that you might secretly think me responsible is unbearable,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“You see, I like to tell myself that I do whatever I can to help Sensei.”“I am sure that Sensei knows that,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Please don’t worry.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Believe you me, Sensei knows.”She leveled off the cinders in the brazier and poured more water from a jug into the iron kettle.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The kettle stopped singing.“Finally, I could not stand it any longer, and so I asked him to tell me frankly whether he found fault with anything I did.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If he would only tell me what my faults were, I said, I would try if possible to correct them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His reply was that I had no faults, and that it was himself that was to blame.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His answer made me very sad.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It made me cry, and made me want to be told more than ever what my faults were.”As Sensei’s wife said this, I noticed that there were tears in her eyes.At first, I thought of Sensei’s wife as a woman of understanding.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But in the course of our conversation her manner began gradually to change, and I found that she had ceased to appeal to my mind, and that she had begun to move my heart.There was no ill-feeling between her and Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, there was no reason why there should be.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Yet, there was something that separated her from Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But no matter how hard she tried, she could not find what this thing was that separated them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This, in short, was her predicament.She claimed that since Sensei disliked the world so much, it was inevitable that she should become a part of the object of Sensei’s dislike.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But she could not convince herself that this was the correct explanation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The poor lady could not avoid thinking that perhaps the very opposite of this was true: namely, that Sensei had become weary of the world because of her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But again, she could find no way of confirming her suspicion.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei’s manner towards her was that of a loving husband.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He was kind and thoughtful.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Such, then, was her secret which she had kept in her heart all these years in gentle sorrow, and which she revealed to me that night.“What do you think?” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Is it because of me that he has become like that, or is it because of his view of life or whatever you men call it?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Please don’t hide anything from me.”I had no intention of hiding anything from her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But since I knew that there were things in Sensei’s life that I did not understand, I could not, in my ignorance, hope to comfort Sensei’s wife.“I really don’t know,” I said.A look of disappointment appeared on her face, and I felt pity for her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I said quickly:“But I can assure you that Sensei does not dislike you.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am only repeating what he himself has told me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And you know that Sensei never lies.”Sensei’s wife said nothing.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After a while, she began to speak again.“I remember something .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.”“You mean something that might explain why Sensei changed?”“Yes.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If it was indeed the cause, then I was not responsible.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There would be at least a little consolation in knowing that much, if I could be sure .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".”“Won’t you tell me?”She hesitated, and gazed at her hands which lay folded on her lap.“I will tell you,” she said, “and you must tell me what you think.”“I will do my best.”“I can’t tell you all.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I do, Sensei will be very angry.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I will tell you only those parts of the story which he would not mind my telling you.”I felt a growing tension inside me.“When Sensei was still at the university, he had a very good friend.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Just before this friend was due to graduate, he died.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He died suddenly.”Then almost in a whisper, she added, “Actually, his death was not natural.” She said this in such a way that I could not help asking immediately, “How?”“I can’t tell you any more about it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, it was after this friend’s death that Sensei began to change gradually.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I don’t know why he died.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I doubt that Sensei does either.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, when one remembers that the change came after the death, one wonders if Sensei really doesn’t know.”“Is it this friend that is buried at Zoshigaya?”“That again I’m not allowed to say.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But can a man change so because of the death of one friend?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I should very much like to know.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That is what I want you to tell me.”I was forced to admit that I did not think so.I tried, as far as I was able, to comfort Sensei’s wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And it seemed that she was trying to find some comfort in my company.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We continued to discuss the death of Sensei’s friend and the change in Sensei that followed it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"However, I knew too little about the matter to be of much help.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei’s wife did not seem to know very much about it either, and her uneasiness concerning it amounted to little more than a few grave doubts.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, she was not free to tell me all that she knew.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In a sea of uncertainty, then, the comforter and the comforted floated about helplessly.At about ten o’clock we heard Sensei’s footsteps approaching the front gate.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Seeming to forget all that we had been talking about, Sensei’s wife quickly stood up and rushed out to meet him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was left behind, as though my presence had been completely forgotten.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I followed Sensei’s wife.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The maid, who was probably dozing in her room, failed to appear in the front hall to greet her master.Sensei seemed to be in a rather good mood.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But his wife was in even better spirits.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remembered the tears in her eyes and the anxiety in her face, and I could not but notice the quick change in her mood.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not really doubt her sincerity.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But had I been so inclined, I might with some justification have thought that she had been playing on my sympathy during our conversation, as is the way with some women.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was not in a critical frame of mind, however, and I was, if anything, rather relieved to see her so cheerful.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There had been no need, I thought to myself, for such concern on my part.Sensei grinned at me and said, “Thank you for your trouble.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"So the burglar didn’t come after all?” Then he added, “Are you disappointed?”“Sorry to have caused you so much inconvenience,” said Sensei’s wife, as I was about to leave.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She seemed not to be apologizing for having taken up so much of a busy student’s time, but rather to be apologizing, in a joking fashion, for the fact that the burglar did not appear.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She then gave me the rest of the cakes, wrapped in a piece of paper, to take home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I put them in my pocket, and went out into the cold night.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I hurried along the winding and almost deserted alleys towards the busier streets.I have written in great detail of the happenings of that evening because now, I see their significance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But that evening, by the time I had left Sensei’s house with the cakes in my pocket, I attached little importance to the conversation I had with Sensei’s wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After lectures the following day, I went back to my lodgings, as usual, for lunch.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
On my desk was the package that Sensei’s wife had given me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I opened it, and choosing a cake covered with chocolate, I began to eat it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought of the couple that had given it to me, and decided that they must surely be happy with each other.Autumn passed uneventfully.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I began to take my clothes to Sensei’s wife to be mended, and it was then too that I began to be more careful in my dress.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She was even kind enough to say that being childless, she welcomed such work as a means of occupying her time.“This is hand-woven,” she once said, pointing to a kimono of mine.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“I have never worked on such beautiful material.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But it’s awfully difficult to sew.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I have already broken two needles on it.”But even when she complained thus, there seemed to be no real resentment in her voice.That winter, I was obliged to go home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A letter had come from my mother, saying that my father’s illness had taken a turn for the worse, and that though there was no immediate danger, I should come home if possible.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As the letter reminded me, my father was, after all, an old man.My father had been suffering from kidney trouble for some time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As is often the case with people who are past middle age, my father’s disease was chronic.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But he and the rest of the family had believed that with good care, the disease could be held in check, and my father had often boasted to his visitors that only through careful living had he managed to survive so far.His condition, however, was worse than we had imagined.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"According to my mother’s letter, he had fainted while pottering about in the garden.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At first, it was believed that he had suffered a mild stroke, but the doctor, who later examined him, decided that the fainting fit had been brought on by his kidney disease.The winter vacation was not far off, and thinking that there was no need for me to return immediately, I decided to stay on till the end of term.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A day or two after the arrival of my mother’s letter, however, I began to worry.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought of my father lying in bed, and of my mother worrying, and I decided that I should return at once.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did not have enough money with me for the train fare and, in order to avoid the inconvenience of having to write home for it and wait for its arrival, I decided to go to Sensei for a loan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wanted, in any case, to pay him a farewell visit.Sensei was suffering from a cold.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As he did not wish to come out into the sitting room, I was asked to see him in his study.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Soft sunlight, such as we had rarely seen that winter, filled the study.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Into this sunny room, Sensei had brought a large brazier.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A metal basin, filled with water, had been placed on it, so that the steam rising from it might ease Sensei’s breathing.“I would rather be truly ill than suffer from a trifling cold like this,” Sensei said, and smiled unhappily at me.Remembering that Sensei had never in his life been seriously ill, I was amused.“I can bear a common cold,” I said, “but I certainly don’t want anything more serious than that.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am sure you will feel the same way about it as I do, Sensei, when you yourself have been really ill.”“I suppose so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As a matter of fact, my feeling is that if I must be ill, then I should like to be mortally ill.”I did not pay much attention to Sensei’s words.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I brought out my mother’s letter, and I asked him for a loan.“Certainly,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“If that is all you want, I am sure we can give it to you right away.”Sensei called his wife, and asked her to bring the money.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She returned, and politely placing the money on a sheet of white paper, said, “You must be worried.”“How often has he fainted?” Sensei asked.“My mother didn’t say.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But is it usual in such cases to faint often?”“Yes.”I was then told that Sensei’s mother-in-law had died from a similar kidney ailment.“At any rate,” I said, “my father cannot be very well.”“I think not,” Sensei said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“I would take his place if I could.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Does he suffer from nausea?”“I don’t know.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Probably not.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At least, there is no mention of it in the letter.”“He is all right,” said Sensei’s wife, “so long as there is no nausea.”I left Tokyo by train that night.My father was not as ill as I had expected.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I returned, I found him sitting up in bed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I’ve been in bed like this,” he said, “to keep the others from worrying.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I’m really well enough to get up.” The next day, he left his bed, much against my mother’s wishes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Because you are here, your father has convinced himself that he is better,” my mother said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But it did not seem to me that he was putting up a brave front for my sake.My elder brother worked in distant Kyushu, and therefore could not visit my parents, unless he felt that there was a pressing need for him to do so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My elder sister was married, and lived in another province.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She also could not easily come home.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I, being a student, was therefore the only one of the three children that my parents could call home freely.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father was nevertheless very pleased that I should have returned so soon after receiving my mother’s letter, without waiting for the end of term.“I am sorry that your studies had to be interrupted,” said my father.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“There has been altogether too much fuss about my slight illness.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Your mother writes too many letters.” He seemed to have recovered his normal health.“You will be ill again,” I said, “unless you take better care of yourself.”He brushed aside my admonition, and said cheerfully:“Don’t you worry.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I shall be all right so long as I look after myself as I always have done.”Indeed, my father seemed well enough.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He wandered about the house with no sign of strain whatsoever.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He looked very pale, it is true, but since this was not a new symptom, we paid little attention to it.I wrote to Sensei, thanking him for the loan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said that I would be returning to Tokyo in January and that if he did not mind, I would wait till then to repay him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I told him that my father was better than I had expected, that there seemed little cause for immediate anxiety, and that he had suffered neither fainting fits nor nausea.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I concluded the letter with a polite inquiry about his cold, which I was inclined to regard as a matter of little concern.I wrote the letter with no expectation of receiving a reply from Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After I had posted it, I told my parents about him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And as I did so, I found myself thinking of Sensei in his study.“When you go back to Tokyo, why don’t you take him some dried mushrooms?”“Thank you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I wonder if Sensei eats such things as dried mushrooms?”“They may not be a delicacy, but surely, no one dislikes them.”Somehow, I could not bring myself to associate dried mushrooms with Sensei.I was rather surprised when a letter from Sensei arrived.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was even more surprised when I read it, for it seemed to have been written for no particular purpose.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei had kindly written, I decided, in reply to my letter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That he should have troubled to do so made me very happy.In case I have unwittingly given the impression that there was much correspondence between Sensei and myself, I should like to say here that in all the time I knew Sensei, I received from him only two pieces of correspondence that might strictly be called “letters.” One of them was the simple letter that I have just mentioned, and the other was a very long letter which he wrote me shortly before his death.My father, not being allowed to be very active, hardly ever left the house after he got up.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once, on a rather sunny day, he stepped out into the garden.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was worried, and kept close to his side.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And when I tried to persuade him to lean on my shoulder, he laughed, and would not listen to me.To help my father forget his boredom, I often played chess with him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We were both by nature very lazy.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We would sit on the floor with a footwarmer between us, and a large quilt covering the footwarmer and our bodies from the waist down.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We would then place the chessboard between us on the frame of the foot-warmer.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After every move, we would put our hands back under the quilt, determined not to sacrifice comfort for the sake of the game.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, we would lose a pawn or two, and not discover the loss until we were ready to start another game.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It amused us all when once my mother found the lost pieces among the cinders in the footwarmer, and had to retrieve them with a pair of tongs.“One good thing about chess is that we can play it in this comfortable position,” my father once said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“It’s an ideal game for lazy people like us.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The trouble with go3 is that the board is too high—and it has legs too—and we couldn’t very well put it between us on the foot warmer and play on it .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"How about another game of chess?”Whether he won or lost, my father always wanted to play another game.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It seemed that he would never tire of playing chess.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At first, I was willing enough to play with him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was a novel experience for me to while away the time thus, as if I were an old man in retirement.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But as the days went by, I began to weary of this inactive life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was too full of youthful vigor to be contented with the role of playmate for my father.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At times, in the middle of a game, I would find myself yawning heavily.I thought of Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And it seemed that with each heartbeat, the yearning within me for action increased.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In a strange way, I felt as if Sensei was by my side, encouraging me to get up and go.I compared my father with Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Both were self-effacing men.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, they were both so self-effacing that as far as the rest of the world was concerned, they might as well have been dead.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They were, from the point of view of the public, complete nonentities.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But while my chess-loving father failed even to entertain me, Sensei, whose acquaintance I had never sought for amusement’s sake, gave me far greater intellectual satisfaction as a companion.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Perhaps I should not have used the word “intellectual,” for it has a cold and impersonal sound.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I should perhaps have said “spiritual” instead.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, it would not have seemed to me then an exaggeration to say that Sensei’s strength had entered my body, and that his very life was flowing in my veins.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And when I discovered that such were my true feelings towards these two men, I was shocked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For was I not of my father’s flesh?At about the time that I began to feel restless at home, my father and mother also began to tire of me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The novelty of having me was wearing off.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
This kind of situation is probably experienced by most people who return home after a long absence.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For the first week or so, there is a great deal of fuss, but when the initial excitement is over, one begins to lose one’s popularity.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My stay at home had passed the initial stage.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, each time I returned, I brought back with me a little more of Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This, my father and mother neither liked nor understood.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As someone in days gone by might have put it, it was like introducing the smell of a Christian into the home of a Confucianist.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I tried, of course, to hide whatever changes Tokyo might have wrought in me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But Tokyo had become a part of me, and my parents could not but notice that I had changed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I ceased to enjoy being at home.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wanted to hurry back to Tokyo.Fortunately, my father’s condition did not seem to grow worse.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To reassure ourselves, we had an eminent doctor, who lived some distance from us, come and examine my father carefully.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The doctor was as well satisfied as we were.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I decided to leave a few days before the end of the winter vacation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Human nature being the perverse thing that it is, my parents opposed my decision.“Leaving so soon?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But you haven’t been home very long!” said my mother.“Surely, you can stay four or five days longer!” said my father.But I did not change my mind.When I returned to Tokyo, I discovered that all the New Year decorations had already been taken down.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I detected little of the New Year spirit as I walked about the cold, windy streets.Soon after my arrival, I visited Sensei to return the money I had borrowed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I also took with me the dried mushrooms.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought it might seem odd to produce the mushrooms without some explanation, so as I put them down in front of Sensei’s wife, I carefully explained that my mother had wished me to present them to her and Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The mushrooms had been put in a new cake-box.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei’s wife thanked me politely, and picked up the box as she rose to go to the next room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She was probably surprised by its lightness, for she said to me: “What kind of cake is this?” The more familiar one became with Sensei’s wife, the more often she seemed to show the innocent and childish side to her character.They were both kind enough to ask after my father.“It would seem,” Sensei said, “that your father is well enough at the moment.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But he must be careful, and not forget that he is a sick man.”Sensei seemed to know all sorts of things about kidney diseases that I did not know.“The trouble with your father’s disease,” Sensei continued, “is that the person who has it is often not aware of it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
An officer I used to know died of it quite suddenly in his sleep.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His wife, who was sleeping next to him, had no time to do anything for him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He woke her up once during the night, saying that he was not feeling well.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The next morning, he was dead.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The unfortunate thing was that his wife had been under the impression that he had gone back to sleep.”I, who had been inclined to be optimistic until then, suddenly became anxious.“Do you think the same thing will happen to my father?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One can’t say that it won’t happen, can one?”“What does the doctor say?”“He says that my father will never be cured.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But he says also that there is no need to worry for a while.”“Well, if the doctor says so, then it’s all right.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The man I was telling you about was after all a careless sort of man.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, he was a soldier, and lived rather immoderately.”I was somewhat comforted by Sensei’s last remarks.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei watched me for a while, observing my relief, and then said:“But men are pretty helpless creatures, whether they are healthy or not.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Who can say how they will die, or when?”“You, of all people, think this?”“Of course.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I may be healthy, but that does not prevent me from thinking about death.”Sensei smiled faintly.“Surely, there are many men who die suddenly, yet quietly, from natural causes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And then there are those whose sudden, shocking deaths are brought about by unnatural violence.”“What do you mean by unnatural violence?”“I am not quite sure; but wouldn’t you say that people who commit suicide are resorting to unnatural violence?”“Then I suppose you would say that people who are murdered die also through unnatural violence?”“I had never thought of that.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But you are right, of course.”Shortly afterwards, I left Sensei and went home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did not worry very much about my father’s illness that night, nor did I spend much time thinking back over what Sensei had said about death.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was more concerned with the problem of my graduation thesis, which I had tried to begin many times before but unsuccessfully.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I should, I told myself, really get down to work on it very soon.I was due to graduate in June that year, and according to the rules, my thesis had to be finished by the end of April.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I counted the number of days that were left to me, and I began to lose confidence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"While the others, it seemed, had been busy for some time collecting their material and accumulating notes, I alone had done nothing except promise myself that I would start work on my thesis in the New Year.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did indeed begin in the early part of the year, but it was not long before I found myself in a state of mental paralysis.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had fondly imagined that by merely thinking vaguely about a few large problems, I was building up a solid and almost complete framework for my thesis.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I discovered my folly as soon as I began to work seriously.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was in despair.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I began to narrow down my thesis topic.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And in order to avoid the trouble of having to present in a systematic manner my own ideas, I decided to compile relevant material from various books, and then add a suitable conclusion.The topic that I had chosen was closely related to Sensei’s field of specialization.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I asked Sensei whether he thought such a topic was suitable, he said that it would probably be all right.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was in a state of panic, and I soon rushed back to Sensei to ask what books I should read.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He willingly gave me all the information he could, and then offered to lend me two or three books that were necessary for my work.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But he steadfastly refused to give me any further guidance.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“I have not been reading very much lately.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am not acquainted with up-to-date scholarship.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You should ask the professors at the university.”When Sensei said this, I remembered the remark his wife once made to me that though Sensei was once an avid reader, he had since lost his old interest in books.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Forgetting my thesis for the moment, I said to Sensei:“Why is it, Sensei, that you are not as interested in books as you once were?”“There is no particular reason .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Well, perhaps it is because I have decided that no matter how many books I may read, I shall never be a very much better man than I am now.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".”“And?”“This is not very important, but to tell you the truth, I used to consider it a disgrace to be found ignorant by other people.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But now, I find that I am not ashamed of knowing less than others, and I am less inclined to force myself to read books.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In short, I have grown old and decrepit.”Sensei’s manner was calm, as he said this.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was not much affected by what he said, perhaps because his tone held none of the bitterness of one who had turned his back on the rest of the world.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I left the house thinking him neither decrepit nor particularly impressive.From then on, my thesis hung over me like a curse, and with bloodshot eyes, I worked like a madman.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I rushed to friends who had graduated the year before for advice on all matters.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
One of them told me that only by catching a rickshaw to the university offices did he succeed in handing in his thesis before the deadline.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Another told me that he handed in his thesis fifteen minutes late, and it would not have been accepted but for the intervention of his principal professor.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Such stories made me uneasy, but at the same time, they gave me confidence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Every day, I worked as hard and as long as I could.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I was not at my desk, I was in the gloomy library, hurriedly scanning the titles on the high shelves, as though I were some kind of curio-hunter.First, the plum trees bloomed, and then the cold wind veered towards the south.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After a while, I heard that the cherry trees were beginning to flower.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I thought of nothing but my thesis.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did not visit Sensei once before the latter part of April, by which time I had finally completed my thesis.I was free at last, when the double cherry blossoms had all fallen and in their place misty green leaves had begun to grow.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was the beginning of summer.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I enjoyed my freedom like a little bird that has flown out of its cage into the open air.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I soon paid Sensei a visit.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On my way to his house, I noticed the young buds on the twigs of the quince hedges bursting into leaf, and I saw too the shiny brown leaves of the pomegranate trees softly reflecting the sunlight.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I relished these sights as though I were seeing them for the first time in my life.Seeing my happy face, Sensei said, “So you have finally finished your thesis.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I’m glad.”“Yes, thanks to you, I have finished it at last,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I have nothing more to do now.”I felt very happy, and I did think then that since I had done what was expected of me, there was indeed nothing left for me to do but relax and enjoy myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I viewed my thesis with a great deal of confidence and satisfaction.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I chattered endlessly to Sensei about what I had said in it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei listened to me in his usual way, and except for an occasional “I see” or “Is that so?” he refused to make any comment.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt not so much dissatisfied as deflated.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"However, I was so full of spirit that day that I wanted to shake Sensei out of his apathy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I tried to lure him out into the fresh green world outside.“Sensei, let us go for a walk.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It’s such a nice day.”“Walk?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Where?”I did not care where we went.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I simply wanted to go outside with Sensei.An hour later, we had left the center of the city, and were walking in a quiet neighborhood that seemed almost rural.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I picked a young, tender leaf from a hawthorne hedge, and began to whistle on it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was a rather accomplished leaf-whistler, having once been taught the trick by a friend from Kagoshima.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I proudly persevered with my whistling for a while, but Sensei kept on walking without paying the slightest attention to me.After a while, we came to a little path which seemed to lead up to a house on a small hill.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The hill was covered with a mass of green foliage.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At the foot of the path was a gate, and on one of the columns was a sign telling us that we were at the entrance to a tree nursery.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We knew then that the path did not lead to a private estate.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Looking up at the gate, Sensei said, “Shall we go in?”I answered quickly, “Yes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They sell trees here, don’t they?”We followed the winding path through the grove until we reached the house, which was on our left.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The sliding doors had been left open, and we could see right into the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There seemed to be no one about.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In a large bowl in front of the house we could see some goldfish.“It certainly is quiet around here,” said Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I wonder if we should have come in without permission?”“I am sure it’s all right.”We walked on, and still we came across no one.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
All about us azaleas flamed in all their splendor.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei pointed to an azalea which grew taller than the others and was reddish-yellow in color.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“That is what we call ‘Kirishima,’4 I think,” he said.There were also peonies covering an area of about ten tsubo.5 It was too early in the summer for them to be in bloom.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
At the edge of this field of peonies was an old bench.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei stretched himself out on it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I sat down on the end, and began to smoke.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei gazed at the sky, which was so blue that it seemed transparent.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was fascinated by the young leaves that surrounded me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I looked at them carefully, I found that no two trees had leaves of exactly the same color.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The leaves of each maple tree, for instance, had their own distinctive coloring.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei’s hat, which he had hung on top of a slender cedar sapling, was blown off by the breeze.I picked up the hat immediately.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Flicking off the bits of red soil from it, I said:“Sensei, your hat fell down.”“Thank you.”Sensei half rose to take his hat.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then remaining in that position—neither sitting nor lying down—he asked me a strange question.“This may seem rather abrupt, but tell me, is your family very wealthy?”“Well, I don’t suppose what we have could be described as a fortune.”“About how much do you have?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I don’t mean to be rude.”“I really don’t know.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We own some woods and a few fields, but I suspect that we have hardly any money at all.”This was the first time that Sensei questioned me directly about my family’s finances.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I had never asked Sensei about his source of income.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, I did wonder how Sensei managed to live in idleness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I had thus far restrained myself from asking Sensei about his means of support, thinking that it would be crude to do so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei’s questions made me forget the trees that I had been peacefully contemplating, and I suddenly found myself asking:“And you, Sensei?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What kind of wealth do you possess?”“Do I look like a rich man to you?”Sensei was never expensively dressed.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He had only one maid, and his house was by no means a large one.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But even I, who was not of the family, could see clearly that he lived comfortably.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One could hardly say that he lived in luxury, it is true, but on the other hand, there was obviously no necessity for him to stint himself.“You are rich, aren’t you?” I said.“I have some money, of course.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I am by no means rich.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If if I were, I would build myself a larger house for one thing.”Sensei was by this time sitting up on the bench, and as he finished talking, he began to trace a circle on the ground with his bamboo cane.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When he had completed the circle, he drove his cane straight into the ground.“I was a rich man, once.”Sensei seemed to be talking as much to himself as to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was at a loss as to what I should say.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I kept quiet.“I was once a rich man, you know,” he said again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This time, he looked at me and smiled.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Still, I remained silent.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt awkward and I could not think of anything to say.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei then changed the subject.“How is your father these days?”I had received no news of my father’s illness since January.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father had continued to write me a short letter every month when he sent me my money order, but he had said very little about his illness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Also, his handwriting had remained firm, and showed none of the hesitancy which one might have expected.“He never tells me how he is.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I think he is quite well now.”“I hope you are right.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But with his disease, you can never tell.”“I don’t suppose there is much hope for him, is there?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I do believe however, that he will stay as well as he is for a while yet.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, I have so far received no bad news.”“Is that so?”I assumed then that Sensei’s questions about my family’s wealth and my father’s illness expressed no more than a normal interest in my affairs, and not knowing much about Sensei’s life history, I could not guess that they implied much more than appeared on the surface.“If there is any property in your family, then I do think you should see to it that your inheritance is properly settled now.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I know that all this is none of my business.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But don’t you think that while your father is alive, you should make sure that you will receive your proper share?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When a man dies suddenly, his estate causes more trouble than anything else.”“Yes, sir.”I did not pay much attention to Sensei’s words.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was my conviction that, in all my family, there was no one that bothered about such matters.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was a little shocked, too, to see Sensei being so intensely practical.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said nothing, however, as I did not wish to seem impertinent.“If I have annoyed you by seeming to anticipate your father’s death, please forgive me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But we all have to die some time, you know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Even the healthy ones—how do we know when they will die?”Sensei’s tone seemed unusually bitter.“I don’t mind at all,” I said, almost in apology.“How many brothers and sisters did you say you had?” asked Sensei.He went on to ask me about my other relatives, such as my uncles and aunts.“Are they all good people?”“Well, they aren’t exactly bad.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They are, after all, country people mostly.”“Why shouldn’t country people be bad?”I began to feel very uncomfortable.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei gave me no time to answer his last question.“As a matter of fact, country people tend to be worse than city people.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You said just now that there was no one amongst your relatives that you would consider particularly bad.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You seem to be under the impression that there is a special breed of bad humans.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There is no such thing as a stereotype bad man in this world.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Under normal conditions, everybody is more or less good, or, at least, ordinary.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But tempt them, and they may suddenly change.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That is what is so frightening about men.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
One must always be on one’s guard.”Sensei looked as if he wanted to continue.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I wanted to say something at this point.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But suddenly a dog began to bark behind us.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Surprised, we turned around.Behind the bench, and next to the cedar saplings, dwarf bamboos grew thickly over a small patch of ground.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The dog was looking at us over the bamboos, barking furiously.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then a boy of about ten appeared on the scene.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He ran to the dog and scolded it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He then turned around towards Sensei, and without taking off his black schoolboy’s cap, bowed.“Sir,” he said, “was there no one in the house when you came by?”“No, there was no one.”“My elder sister and my mother were in the kitchen, you know.”“Is that so?”“Yes, sir.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You should have called out ‘Good-afternoon’ and then come in.”Sensei smiled faintly.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He pulled out his purse and finding a five-sen piece, gave it to the boy.“Go to your mother, and say that we would like her permission to rest here for a while.”With laughter in his intelligent eyes, he nodded.“At the moment, I am chief of the army scouts,” he said, and then rushed down the hill through the azaleas.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The dog, with his tail held up, rushed after him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A moment or two later, two or three children of about the same age as the chief of scouts ran past us and disappeared down the hill.Sensei would have made the purpose of his remarks clearer to me, had it not been for the sudden appearance of the dog and the boy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I was left, for the moment, somewhat uncertain as to why Sensei should have spoken to me thus.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, I did not share Sensei’s interest in such matters as money, inheritance, and so on, partly because of my relatively easy circumstances, and partly because of my nature.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Now, when I think of myself at that time, I see how unworldly I was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I had known the meaning of material hardship then, I would have listened to Sensei more carefully.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, money seemed to me a very distant problem.Among the things that Sensei said, what interested me most was his remark that no man was immune to temptation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I knew, more or less, what Sensei meant, of course.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I wanted Sensei to talk more about the matter.After the departure of the dog and the children, the large garden became quiet once more.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We sat still for a moment or two, as though made immovable by the silence around us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The beautiful sky began slowly to lose its brightness.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And before us, the delicate, green maple leaves, which looked like drops of water just about to fall from the branches, seemed to grow darker in color.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From the road below, the sound of cart wheels reached our ears.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I imagined that a man from the village had loaded his cart with plants or vegetables, and was on his way to some fair to sell them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei stood up, as though the sound had aroused him from his meditation.“Let us go home,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“The days are becoming longer, but dusk seems to fall quickly when we are sitting about lazily like this.”The back of Sensei’s coat was dirty, and I brushed it clean with my hand.“Thank you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You don’t see any resin marks, do you?”“No.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It’s perfectly clean now.”“I had this coat made only recently.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I get it too dirty, my wife will scold me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Thank you.”On our way down the gently sloping path, we passed the house once more.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This time, we saw the lady of the house on the front porch, winding thread onto a spool with the help of a young girl of about fifteen or sixteen.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Stopping by the large goldfish bowl, we said: “Thank you for your hospitality.”“Not at all,” said the woman, and then thanked us for the coin that her boy had received.After we had walked a few hundred yards beyond the gate, I suddenly said to Sensei:“What did you mean, Sensei, when you remarked that if tempted, any man may suddenly become evil?”“What did I mean?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There was no profound meaning in my remark.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was not theorizing, you understand.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was merely stating an obvious fact.”“I do not wish to deny that it is a fact.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What I want to know is exactly what kind of temptation you were referring to.”Sensei began to laugh, as if he no longer wished to discuss the matter seriously.“Money, of course.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Give a gentleman money, and he will soon turn into a rogue.”Sensei’s trite answer disappointed me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei refused to be serious, and my pride was hurt.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"With a nonchalant air, I began to walk more quickly, leaving Sensei behind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Hey!” he called to me.“You see?” he said.“What, sir?”“One simple remark, and your whole attitude towards me, you see, has changed.” I had turned around to wait for Sensei, and as he spoke, he looked straight into my eyes.At that moment I hated Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And after we had resumed our walk side by side, I refrained from asking the questions I wanted to ask.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not tell whether or not Sensei knew how I felt: at any rate, he seemed not to pay much attention to my behavior.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He was his usual relaxed self as he walked silently by my side.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I became spiteful.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wanted to say something that would humiliate him.“Sensei,” I said.“Yes, what is it?”“You became a little excited, didn’t you, Sensei, when we were resting in the tree nursery?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You are very rarely excited, and I feel that today, I was permitted to observe a rather unusual occurrence.”Sensei did not reply immediately.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought that perhaps my remarks had had their effect on him, but at the same time, I could not help being slightly disappointed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I decided to say no more.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then suddenly, Sensei left my side, and walking up to a neatly trimmed hedge, began to urinate.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I stood by foolishly, and waited for him.“Pardon me,” he said, as we set off again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I gave up all thought of trying to humiliate him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Gradually, the road became busier.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The open fields that had been visible to us before were now almost completely hidden by rows of houses.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Even then, there were sights that reminded us of the quiet countryside, such as peas growing around bamboo stakes in private gardens, and hens being kept in enclosures of wire netting.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We passed an endless procession of cart horses, returning from the city.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I, who was inclined to become absorbed in all such details of the scene around me, soon ceased to worry about what Sensei had said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, I had totally forgotten my last words to him, when he suddenly said to me:“Did I seem so excited to you back there in the nursery?”“Not very; perhaps a little .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.”“I don’t mind at all your saying that I was very excited.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You see, I really do become excited when I start speaking of inheritances, and so on.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It may not seem so to you, but I have a very vindictive nature.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The indignities and injuries I suffered ten years ago—even twenty years ago—I have not yet forgotten.” There was even less restraint in Sensei’s words than there had been previously that day.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What shocked me was not the tone of his voice so much as what he had actually said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had never thought, of course, that I would ever hear such an admission from Sensei, nor imagined that there was such a tenacious streak in his character.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had believed him to be rather a weak person.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I had loved Sensei for this weakness, whether real or imagined, no less than for his virtues.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I, who a short while ago had tried to pick a quarrel with him, began to feel small.“I was once deceived,” Sensei said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Moreover, I was deceived by my own blood relations.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I shall never forget this.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When my father was alive, they behaved like decent people.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But as soon as he died, they turned into scoundrels.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The effect of the injury that they did me in my youth is with me still.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It will be with me, I suppose, until I die.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What they did to me, I shall remember so long as I live.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I have never taken my revenge on them.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I think about it, I have done something much worse than that.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I have come not only to hate them, but the human race in general.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That is quite enough, I think.”Not even words of consolation came to my lips.We talked no more about the subject that day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was somewhat awed by his manner, and I did not want to ask him any more questions.When we reached the outskirts of the city proper, we boarded a tram.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We hardly spoke to each other during the ride back.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We parted shortly after we got off the tram.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"By that time, Sensei’s mood had changed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before leaving me, he said in a tone more cheerful than usual, “You will be really carefree from now till June, won’t you?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Perhaps you will never again in your life be so free from responsibility.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Enjoy yourself as much as you can.” I grinned as I took off my cap.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And looking at his face, I wondered how such a man could carry so much hatred in his heart.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His smiling eyes and lips showed nothing of the misanthrope.I should like to say here that I profited considerably from my conversations with Sensei.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Many times, however, I found Sensei very unsatisfactory as a mentor.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I felt often that he was being purposely evasive: such was my feeling concerning our conversation that day.Being a blunt and discourteous young man, I told Sensei one day that I had often found our conversation rather inconclusive.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei laughed, and I said:“I would not mind so much, if I thought that you were too dull a person to realize that your remarks are often not very clear to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I do mind, because I know that you could tell me much more if you so wished.”“I hide nothing from you.”“Yes, sir, you do.”“It would appear that you are unable to distinguish between my ideas at present and the events of my past.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am not much of a thinker, but the few ideas that I do have, I have no wish to hide from others.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I have no reason to.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But if you are suggesting that I should tell you all about my past—well, that’s another matter entirely.”“I do not agree with you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I value your opinions because they are the results of your experience.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Your opinions would be worthless otherwise.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
They would be like soulless dolls.”Sensei stared at me in astonishment.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I saw that his hand, which held a cigarette, was shaking a little.“You are certainly an audacious young man,” he said.“No, sir, I am simply being sincere.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And in all sincerity, I wish to learn about life.”“Even to the extent of digging up my past?”Suddenly, I was afraid.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I felt as though the man sitting opposite me were some kind of criminal, instead of the Sensei that I had come to respect.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei’s face was pale.“I wonder if you are being really sincere,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Because of what happened to me, I have come to doubt everybody.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In truth, I doubt you too.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But for some reason, I do not want to doubt you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It may be because you seem so simple.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before I die, I should like to have one friend that I can truly trust.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wonder if you can be that friend.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Are you really sincere?”“I have been true to you, Sensei,” I said, “unless my whole life has been a lie.” My voice shook as I spoke.“Very well, then,” said Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“I will tell you.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I will tell you all about my past.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But remember—no, never mind about that.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Let me simply warn you that to know my past may do you no good.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It may be better for you not to know.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I cannot tell you just yet.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Don’t expect me to tell you until the proper time to do so has come.”I returned to my lodgings with an oppressive feeling—like a sense of doom—inside me.My professors apparently did not have as high an opinion of my thesis as I did.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was, however, allowed to graduate that year.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the day of the graduation ceremony, I brought out my old and musty winter uniform from my suitcase, and put it on.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Everyone around me in the graduation hall looked hot.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My body felt as if it had been sealed in an airtight envelope of thick wool.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Very quickly, the handkerchief that I was holding in my hand became soaking wet.I went back to my lodgings as soon as the ceremony was over, and stripped to the skin.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I opened the window of my room, which was on the second floor, and pretending that my diploma was a telescope, I surveyed as much of the world as I could see.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then I threw the diploma down on the desk, and lay on the floor in the middle of the room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In that position, I thought back over my past, and tried to imagine what my future would be.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought about my diploma lying on the desk, and though it seemed to have some significance as a kind of symbol of the beginning of a new life, I could not help feeling that it was a meaningless scrap of paper too.That evening, I went to Sensei’s house for dinner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had promised him earlier that if I graduated, I would dine with him, and not with anyone else.For this occasion, the table had been put in the drawing room, near the verandah.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the table was an embroidered cloth, heavily starched.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It reflected the electric light beautifully.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As always when I dined at Sensei’s, I found the bowls and chopsticks neatly laid out on white linen such as one sees in the European-style restaurants.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And the linen was always spotless, having obviously been freshly laundered.“It is the same with shirt collars and cuffs,” Sensei once said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“If one is going to use soiled linen, one might as well start with colored linen.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But white linen must always be spotless.”Indeed, Sensei was a very tidy person.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His study, for instance, was always in perfect order.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Being rather careless myself, Sensei’s tidiness often attracted my attention.“Sensei is rather fastidious, isn’t he?” I once said to his wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Perhaps so,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“But when it comes to clothes, he certainly is not overcareful.” Sensei, who was listening to us, said with a laugh, “To tell the truth, I have a fastidious mind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That is why I am always worrying.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When you think about it, it’s a terrible nuisance to have a nature like mine.”What he meant by “a fastidious mind,” I did not know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Neither, it seemed, did his wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Perhaps he meant to say that he was too intensely conscious of right and wrong, or perhaps he meant that his fastidiousness amounted to something like a morbid love of cleanliness.That evening, I sat opposite Sensei at the table.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei’s wife sat between us, facing the garden.“Congratulations,” Sensei said, and raised his saké cup to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The gesture did not make me particularly happy, partly because by then, I was not in such high spirits about having graduated, and partly because Sensei’s tone of voice did not seem to invite a merry response from me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, he grinned at me when he raised his cup, and I did not detect any irony in his grin.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But neither did it convey happiness for my success.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His grin seemed rather to say, “It is, for some strange reason, considered proper to congratulate people on such occasions as this.”Sensei’s wife was good enough to say, “Well done.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Your father and mother must be pleased.” I was suddenly reminded of my sick father by this remark, and thought, “I must hurry home and show my diploma to him.”“What has become of your diploma, Sensei?”“I wonder .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You put it away somewhere, didn’t you?” Sensei asked his wife.“Yes, I think so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It should be somewhere in the house.”Neither of them seemed to know exactly where the diploma was.When it was time for the main course to be served, Sensei’s wife sent away the maid who was sitting by her side and waited on us herself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This was their customary procedure, I believe, when they had friends, rather than formal guests, to dinner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The first two or three times I had dinner there, I felt somewhat ill at ease, but eventually, I learned to ask Sensei’s wife to refill my bowl without the slightest hesitation or embarrassment.“Tea?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Rice?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You certainly eat a lot,” she would say sometimes, in a pleasantly informal manner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That evening, however, I gave her no opportunity to tease me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It being summer, I did not have much of an appetite.“Finished already?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You certainly have become a small eater these days.”“I would eat as much as ever, if it weren’t for the heat.”After the maid had cleared the table, Sensei’s wife served fruit and ice cream.“I made this myself, you know.”Sensei’s wife, it seemed, had so little to do in the house that she could, if she wished, serve her guests homemade ice cream.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had three helpings of it.“Now that you have finally graduated, what do you intend to do?” Sensei asked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He had moved his cushion towards the verandah, and was leaning against the sliding door.My mind was preoccupied with the fact that I had graduated, and I had not begun to think seriously about my future.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Seeing me hesitate, Sensei’s wife said: “Do you intend to teach?” Again, I did not reply immediately, and she added: “Or work for the government, perhaps?” Sensei and I both began to laugh.“To be honest, I have no idea.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I have really not thought much about my career.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I find it difficult to decide what profession would suit me best, since I have had no experience.“That may be,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“But it is because your people have money that you can afford to be so unconcerned about your future.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You would not be so easygoing, if you were in less fortunate circumstances.”I knew of course that she was right.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Some of my friends at the university had started looking for posts in secondary schools long before their graduation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I said:“Perhaps I have been influenced by Sensei.”“Really!” she said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“You shouldn’t allow yourself to be influenced in such a way.”Sensei smiled wryly, and said:“I don’t care if it’s my influence or not.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But as I have already said, make sure that your father will leave you a reasonable amount of money.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Otherwise, you cannot afford to be so easygoing.”Then I remembered our conversation in the tree nursery, that day in early May when the azaleas were in bloom.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I remembered his words spoken in agitation on our way back from there.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They had momentarily frightened me, but I, being ignorant of Sensei’s past, had not given them much thought since.“Madam,” I said, “are you and Sensei very rich?”“Why do you ask such a question?”“I asked Sensei, and he wouldn’t tell me.”She laughed and looked at Sensei.“Perhaps he is reluctant to tell you because he hasn’t very much.”“But I want to know what sum will be sufficient to enable me to live as Sensei does, so that when I speak to my father about my inheritance, I shall have some idea of what I want.”Sensei was looking at the garden, calmly smoking a cigarette.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His wife again had to do the answering:“We don’t have very much.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We manage to make ends meet, that’s all.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, what money we have has nothing to do with your future.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You really must think seriously about your career.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You must not live your life in complete idleness, like Sensei.”“I do not live in complete idleness,” said Sensei, turning his head slightly in our direction.I left Sensei’s house a little after ten o’clock.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As I was due to go home in two or three days’ time, I said a few words of farewell before rising from my seat.“I shall not be seeing you for some time.”“I suppose you will be back in Tokyo in September?” said Sensei’s wife.I had no intention of coming back to Tokyo in August in the full heat of the summer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not think that I would be seeking a post that soon.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And in truth, there was no need to return in September either, since I had finished with the university.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I said:“Yes, I shall probably be back in September.”“Take good care of yourself,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“We are going to have a bad summer, apparently.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We shall probably go away somewhere too.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If we do, we’ll send you a postcard.”“Where do you think you might go ?”Sensei, who had been listening to us with an odd grin on his face, said:“We really don’t know that we are going anywhere.”As I was about to rise, Sensei suddenly said, “By the way, how is your father?” I said that I did not know, but that I assumed that he was no worse, since the letters from home had said nothing about his health.“You must not regard your father’s illness so lightly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once there is uraemia poisoning, he will be finished.”I had no idea what uraemia poisoning was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The doctor, whom I saw during the winter vacation, had certainly said nothing about it.“You really must take good care of him,” said Sensei’s wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“When the poison reaches the brain, there’s no hope, you know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It is no laughing matter, either.”I had been smiling uneasily, not knowing what to say.“His disease is incurable, anyway,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“There is nothing to be gained by worrying.”“If you can truly be so resigned about it,” she said quietly, “then there’s nothing more to be said.”She lowered her eyes, as though she was thinking of her mother, who had died of the same illness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I too began to feel sad about my father’s fate.Then Sensei suddenly turned to his wife.“Shizu, I wonder if you will die before me?”“Why?”“Why?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was just wondering.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Or will I die first?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It appears that women usually outlive their husbands.”“Perhaps, but how can one be sure?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, husbands are usually older than their wives.”“And so, you think, husbands will die sooner than their wives.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In that case, I am certain to leave this world before you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Isn’t that so?”“No, not at all.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You are different.”“Really?”“You are so healthy.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You have hardly ever been ill. No doubt, I shall be the first to go.”“Are you sure?”“Yes, of course.”Sensei looked at me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I smiled.“But if I die first,” he continued, “what will you do?”“What will I do .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
?” Sensei’s wife hesitated.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For a moment, she seemed afraid, as though she had caught a brief glimpse of the life of sorrow she would lead when Sensei was gone.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But when she looked up again, her mood had changed.“What will I do?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Why, what do you expect me to do?” she said lightheartedly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I shall simply tell myself that ‘death comes to old and young alike,’ as the saying goes.” She deliberately looked at me, when she said this.I had been on the point of leaving when the conversation started, but I decided to stay a little while longer and keep the two company.“What do you think?” Sensei asked me.Which of the two would die first was obviously not a question that I could answer intelligently, so I smiled and said:“I also do not know what your predestined span of life is.”“It certainly is a matter of predestination, if nothing else is,” Sensei’s wife said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“We are all given a certain number of years to live when we are born.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Did you know that Sensei’s father and mother died almost simultaneously?”“On the same day?”“Well, perhaps not on the same day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But one died very shortly after the other.”This, I had not known.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought it rather curious.“How was it that they died at the same time?”Sensei’s wife was about to answer me, when she was interrupted by her husband.“Don’t say any more about it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It is of no interest.”Sensei made as much noise as he could with his fan.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He then turned to his wife again.“Shizu, this house will be yours when I die.”Sensei’s wife laughed.“You might as well will me the land too.”“I can’t give you the land, since it doesn’t belong to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But everything I own is yours.”“Thank you very much.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But of what use would all those foreign books of yours be to me?”“You can sell them to some secondhand bookshop.”“And what will I get for them, if I do?”Sensei did not answer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He continued to talk, however, on the subject of his own death.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And all the while, he seemed to have taken it for granted that he was going to die before his wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At first, she seemed determined to treat the subject in a frivolous spirit.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But eventually, the conversation began to oppress her sensitive woman’s heart.“How many more times are you going to say, ‘When I die, when I die’?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For heaven’s sake, please don’t say ‘when I die’ again!",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It’s unlucky to talk like that.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When you die, I shall do as you wish.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There, let that be the end of it.”Sensei turned towards the garden, and laughed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But to please her, he dropped the subject.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was getting late, and so I stood up to go.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei and his wife came to the front hall with me.“Take good care of your father,” she said.“Till September, then,” he said.I said goodbye and stepped out of the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Between the house and the outer gate, there was a bushy osmanthus tree.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It spread its branches into the night, as if to block my way.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I looked at the dark outline of the leaves, and thought of the fragrant flowers that would be out in the autumn.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said to myself, I have come to know this tree well, and it has become, in my mind, an inseparable part of Sensei’s house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As I stood in front of the tree, thinking of the coming autumn when I would be walking up the path once more, the porch light suddenly went out.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Sensei and his wife had apparently gone into their bedroom.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I stepped out alone into the dark street.I did not return to my lodgings immediately.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There were a few things I wanted to buy before going home, and I felt also that I needed a walk after the big dinner I had eaten.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I walked towards the busy part of the town.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There, the night had only just begun.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The streets were crowded with men and women who seemed to have come out for no particular purpose.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I ran into a university acquaintance who had also graduated that day.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He forced me to go into a bar with him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There, I had to sit and listen to my fellow graduate, whose talk was as frothy as the beer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was past midnight when I returned to my room.I had been asked by the family to buy a few things before leaving Tokyo, so I spent the next day shopping despite the heat.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That morning as I set out on my errands, I found myself being very annoyed at the prospect of having to walk about the busy streets on such a hot day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And as I sat in the tram, wiping the perspiration from my face, I began to hate country people who were always ready to bother others busier than themselves with annoying requests.I did not intend to spend the whole summer in idleness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had already prepared a kind of daily schedule which I intended to follow when I got home, and so there were books that I had to buy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I went to the Maruzen Bookshop, and, prepared to spend half the day there if need be, I examined carefully all the books that dealt with my subject of study.Of the items that I was asked to buy, the one that gave me most trouble was a chemisette.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The apprentice at the shop was willing enough to bring out as many as I wished to see, but I found it very difficult to decide which I should buy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Also, prices varied greatly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Those that I thought would be cheap turned out to be very dear, and those that looked expensive to me turned out to be very cheap.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Precisely what it was that made one chemisette better than another, I could not understand.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I regretted not having asked Sensei’s wife to buy one for me.I bought a suitcase also.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, it was a cheap one, made in Japan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But it had metal fittings that shone brilliantly, and it was impressive enough to stun country people.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My mother had asked me in one of her letters to buy such a bag for myself if I graduated, so that I could come home with all the presents packed in it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I laughed when I read the request.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I understood my mother’s motives, and I was not being unkind when I found it comical.I left Tokyo three days later, as had been my intention when I took leave of Sensei and his wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was not overly worried about my father, in spite of the warnings that Sensei had given me since winter concerning his illness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Rather, I felt sorry for my mother, whose life after my father’s death would, I knew, be very lonely.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No doubt, I had come to regard it as inevitable that my father should die soon.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In a letter to my elder brother in Kyushu, I had said that there was no hope of my father’s regaining his former health.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In another letter, I had advised him to return home that summer if possible, to see my father before he died.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had even gone so far as to add, in a somewhat emotional strain, that we, their children, should feel pity for the old couple that led such lonely lives in the country.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When writing such letters, I was quite sincere.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But after writing them, my mood would change.On the train, I thought about my own inconsistency.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The more I thought about it, the more fickle I seemed, and I became dissatisfied with myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I then thought of Sensei and his wife, and the evening of my last dinner with them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remembered Sensei saying, “Which of us will die first?” And I thought: “How can anyone answer such a question?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And if Sensei knew the answer, what would he do?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What would his wife do, if she knew?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Probably, they would behave exactly as if they did not know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As I am sitting here now, helpless, though I know that my father is waiting to die .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".” I felt then the helplessness of man, and the vanity of his life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
* * *1 The English word “teacher” which comes closest in meaning to the Japanese word sensei is not satisfactory here.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The French word maître would express better what is meant by sensei.2 He had been a “college” student before.3 A kind of checkers.4 Literally, this means “mist island.”5 Ten tsubo is about forty square yards.Part TwoMy Parents and IWHAT surprised me when I got home was that my father’s health seemed not to have changed much during the months I had been away.“So you are back,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“I’m glad that you were able to graduate.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Wait a minute, I’ll go and wash my face.”I had found him in the garden.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was wearing an old straw hat, with a slightly soiled handkerchief attached to the back to shield his neck from the sun.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The handkerchief swayed in the breeze as he walked towards the well behind the house.I had come to regard a university education as commonplace, and I was touched by my father’s unexpected pleasure at my graduation.“I am glad that you were able to graduate,” he said repeatedly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Inwardly, I compared my father’s unaffected pleasure with the way Sensei had congratulated me that night at the dinner table.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I had greater admiration for Sensei with his secret contempt for such things as university degrees, than I had for my father, who seemed to me to value them more than they were worth.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I began at last to dislike my father’s naïve provincialism.“You shouldn’t get so excited over such a trifling thing as a university degree,” I blurted out.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“After all, several hundred students graduate every year.” My father looked at me strangely.“It isn’t simply your graduation that I am happy about, you know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, I am glad that you graduated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But you don’t know all the reasons why I say I am glad.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
If you could only understand .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.”I asked him what he meant.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He seemed reluctant to tell me, but finally he said:“You see, I am glad for my own sake.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As you know, I am a sick man.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When you were home last winter, I was convinced that I had no more than three or four months left to live.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Providentially, I am still alive, and am able to potter about comfortably.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And now, you have graduated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am happy because you, who have worked so hard at your studies, managed to graduate before I died, and while I was in good health.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Surely, I, as your father, have reason to be happy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, you have bigger ideas than I, and it must annoy you to see me fuss over such an insignificant thing as your graduation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But try to look at it from my point of view.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am glad, not so much for your sake, as for my own.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Do you understand?”I said nothing.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
No word of apology would have expressed how I felt.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I hung my head in deep shame.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Calmly, he had been waiting for his death, believing that he would die before my graduation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I had been too stupid to realize how much it meant to my father to be alive when I graduated.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I brought out my diploma from my bag, and carefully showed it to my father and mother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had not packed it well, and it was badly creased.“You should have rolled it, and carried it in your hand,” said my father.“You should have protected it with something stiff,” added my mother from his side.My father looked at it for a while, then got up and went to the ornamental alcove of the room, and placed it where everyone could see it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Ordinarily, I would have said something, but at that moment, I was not my usual self.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had no desire to argue with my parents.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I kept quiet and let my father do as he wished.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The diploma was made of stiff paper, and having become misshapen in the packing, it refused to stay still, and collapsed each time my father tried to stand it up.I drew my mother aside and asked her about my father’s illness.“Is it all right for my father to be so active?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Going out into the garden, for instance .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.”“There seems to be nothing the matter with him now.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He has probably recovered.”My mother was surprisingly optimistic and unconcerned.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As is commonly the case with women who live among woods and fields far from cities, my mother was quite ignorant about such matters.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remembered, a little uneasily, how surprised and frightened she had been when my father had fainted.“But the doctor warned us then that father’s illness was serious.”“That’s why I think there is nothing stranger than the human body.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Look at him now—so healthy, in spite of the doctor’s anxiety.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At first, I was worried, and tried to keep him still.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But you know how he is.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He does try to be careful, of course.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But he is so stubborn.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He has decided he is well, and won’t listen to whatever I may have to say.”I remembered how, the last time I had come home, my father had insisted on leaving his bed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I am all right now,” he had said, after a shave.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Your mother fusses too much.” And remembering that occasion, I thought that my mother was not entirely to blame.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had been on the verge of saying, “But you should take his illness more seriously, even if he doesn’t,” but decided to say nothing after all.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It would be unjust, I thought, to chide her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Instead, I told her all I knew about my father’s disease.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, I knew little more than what Sensei and his wife had told me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My mother seemed not particularly impressed or interested.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She made only such remarks as: “Is that so?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The lady died of the same disease?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That’s too bad.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And how old was she, when she died?”I gave up trying to convince my mother of the seriousness of my father’s illness, and decided to speak to my father.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He listened to me more attentively than my mother had done.“Of course, you are right,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“But after all, my body is my own, and I know what’s good for it and what is not.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From experience alone, I should know how to look after it better than anyone else.” My mother, when I told her what he had said, smiled wryly and said: “See?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What did I tell you?”“But,” I said to her, “in spite of what he says, he is preparing to die, you know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That is why he was so glad when I came back with the diploma from the university.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He himself was saying to me how fortunate he was that I should have graduated while he was still healthy, and not after his death as he had feared.”“What he says, and what he thinks are quite different things,” my mother said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Secretly, he thinks that he has recovered.”“I wonder if you are right,” I said.“Why, he intends to live another ten or twenty years.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, he sometimes says depressing things to me too.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Only the other day, he said to me: ‘It doesn’t look as if I’m going to live much longer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What will you do when I’m dead?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Do you intend to live all alone in this house?’ ”I pictured to myself the large, old country house without my father, and with only my mother living in it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Could the house be kept up without him?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What would my mother do?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What would my mother say?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Would I be able to leave home, and live without worry in Tokyo?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And as I sat there, facing my mother, I began to think of Sensei’s advice that I should try to get my share of the family fortune while my father was still alive.Then my mother said: “There’s no need to worry.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
When did anyone die who kept on saying that he was going to die?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Despite the fact that your father says he expects to die soon, he will probably be living many years from now.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Rather, it is we, who are so certain of our good health, that are in real danger.”Wondering whether she thought her ideas to be logically irrefutable or statistically demonstrable, I listened to my mother’s platitudes in silence.My parents began to discuss plans for a dinner party in my honor.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Ever since my return, I had been secretly fearing that such a notion might enter their heads.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I immediately objected.“Don’t do anything so elaborate for my sake, please,” I said.I hated the kind of guests that came to a country dinner party.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They came with one end in view, which was to eat and drink, and they were the sort of people that waited eagerly for any event which might provide a break in the monotony of their lives.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Since childhood, I had hated to see them at our house and to have to behave respectfully towards them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That they were now to be invited to dinner for my sake made me feel even less friendly towards them.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I could hardly say to my parents, “Don’t invite those rowdy boors here.” I pretended, then, that it was the elaborateness of such a party that I disliked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Elaborate?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Certainly not!” said my mother.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Such an occasion as this comes but once in a lifetime.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It is only natural that we should have guests to celebrate.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Don’t be so retiring.”My mother seemed to attach about as much importance to my graduation as she would have done to my marriage.“We don’t have to invite them, of course,” said my father, “but if we don’t, there will be talk.”He was afraid of gossip.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was certain that our neighbors were hoping to be asked, and that if they were disappointed, they would indeed start gossiping.“We are not in Tokyo, you know,” said my father.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Country people are rather fussy and resentful.”“You must consider your father’s reputation too,” said my mother.I could not go on being stubborn.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I began to think that it would be better to let my parents do as they pleased.“I was merely saying that you need not do it for my sake.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But if you are afraid of gossip, then of course it’s a different matter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Who am I to insist on something that may do you harm?”“You embarrass me with your argumentative talk,” said my father sourly.“It isn’t that your father is saying that we are not having a party for your sake,” said my mother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“But even you must be aware of one’s duty to one’s neighbors.”My mother, like all women, was inclined, at times, to make incoherent remarks.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In loquacity, however, she was more than a match for my father and me even when we sided together against her.“The trouble with education,” said my father, “is that it makes a man argumentative.”He said no more then.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But in that simple remark, I saw clearly the character of his resentment towards me, which I had sensed before.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Not realizing that I myself was being rather difficult, I felt strongly the injustice of my father’s reproach.That evening, there was a change in my father’s mood.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He asked me when it would be convenient to hold the dinner party.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He knew perfectly well that I was then spending my time in complete idleness.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His asking the question was therefore his way of trying to bring about a reconciliation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not but be touched by my father’s gentleness, and I became more obedient.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After a short discussion, we agreed upon the date.Before the day of the dinner party arrived, however, an important event took place.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Emperor Meiji was taken ill.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This news, which was spread throughout the nation by the newspapers, reached us like a gust of wind, blowing away the plans for a graduation party which had been tentatively made, not without difficulty, in an insignificant country house.“I think that we had better cancel the dinner,” said my father when he read the news, looking at me over the top of his spectacles.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He then became silent, and it seemed to me that he was thinking of his own illness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I sat quietly too, thinking of the Emperor who had so recently attended the graduation ceremony at the university, as he was wont to do every year.I brought out the books from my suitcase, and in the silent, old house, too large for the three of us, I began to read them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For some reason, I could not settle down.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It had been easier to study in the middle of bustling Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In the small room on the second floor of the boarding house, where I could hear the distant sound of running trams, I had found no difficulty in concentrating on whatever I was reading.Often, I found myself dozing over my books, and sometimes, I went as far as to bring out my pillow and take a nap in earnest.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I would wake to the cry of the cicadas, which at first would seem to have been a part of my dreams, and then suddenly, I would be fully awake, and find the harsh cry almost unbearable.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, I would lie still and listen to it for a moment or two, and my heart would fill with sadness.I wrote to various friends.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, I sent short notes written on postcards, and sometimes, long letters.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Some of my friends were still in Tokyo, and some had gone home to distant provinces.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Some wrote back, and some did not.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did not, of course, forget Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wrote him a long letter, covering three double pages of foolscap paper with small handwriting, and told him all that had happened to me since my return.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As I sealed the envelope, I wondered if Sensei would still be in Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was the custom, whenever Sensei and his wife went away, for a lady of about fifty, with her hair cut and let down in the style affected by gentlewomen of her age, to come and look after the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once, when I asked Sensei who the lady was, he asked me in turn, “Who do you think she is?” When I said that I took her for some relation of his, he replied, “But I have no relations.” Indeed, Sensei had come to ignore completely the existence of his family in his home province.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The lady, it turned out, was related to Sensei’s wife.I thought of this lady, then, as I went out to post my letter, and I wondered whether she would have the sense and the kindness to forward it, should Sensei and his wife have left by the time it reached Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I knew, of course, that I had said nothing of importance in the letter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was simply that I was lonely.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I hoped for a reply from him, but it never came.My father did not show as much interest in chess as he had done the previous winter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The chessboard lay in the corner of the ornamental alcove, covered with dust.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He seemed more quiet than ever since the Emperor’s illness.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Every day, he would wait for the newspaper to arrive, and when it came, he would read it first.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then he would bring it to me, and say:“Look, there’s more news of His Majesty today.”He always referred to the Emperor as “His Majesty.”“I don’t wish to seem irreverent,” he once said, “but it does look as if His Majesty’s illness is not unlike mine.”I could see deep anxiety on his face as he said this, and I thought to myself, “How long will it be before he faints again?”“But I am sure His Majesty will be all right,” my father said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Why, if a worthless fellow like me can be up and about like this .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".”Despite his attempts at being optimistic, however, I suspected that he feared the worst for himself.“Father is really worried about his illness, you know,” I said to my mother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“It doesn’t look as if he expects to live another ten or twenty years, as you seem to think he did.”My mother appeared to be perplexed by my words.“Why don’t you persuade him to play chess with you,” she said.I brought out the chessboard, and dusted it.My father’s health grew steadily worse.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The old straw hat with the handkerchief attached to it, which had so amazed me when I first saw it on my father, now was laid aside.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And every time I saw it lying on the smoke-blackened shelf, I felt pity for him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before, when he had been active, I had wished that he would not move about so much.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I hated to see him lose his old vigor, and to find him sitting about the house so quietly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My mother and I talked often of my father’s health.“It’s just his mood,” she once said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“He is depressed.” She seemed to think that my father was depressed because of the Emperor’s illness.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not agree with her.“I don’t think that it is simply his mood,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I think that he is feeling really ill.”I began then to consider seriously calling in a good specialist once more and have him examine my father.“You can’t be enjoying yourself very much this summer,” my mother said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“We haven’t even celebrated your graduation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Your father hasn’t been well, and now, His Majesty .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We should have had a dinner party immediately after your return.”I had come home on the fifth or sixth of July, and it was about a week after that that my parents had started discussing plans for the dinner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
They had then decided to hold it the following week.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One might say that due to the easygoing ways of my parents who, like all country people, could do nothing in a hurry, I had been spared an unpleasant social obligation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But my mother, who did not understand me, could not see this.When the newspaper announcing the Emperor’s death arrived, my father said: “Oh!",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Oh!” And then “Oh, His Majesty is gone at last.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I too .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.” My father then fell silent.I went to town to buy some black crepe.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We wrapped a piece of it around the golden ball at the end of the flag pole.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From another piece of crepe, we made a ribbon about three inches wide, and hung it from the pole near the top.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The pole was then attached slantwise to one of the gate posts.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The air was very still, and both the flag and the black ribbon hung limply.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The old gate of our house had a thatched roof over it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The thatch had acquired a grey ashlike hue from years of exposure to wind and rain.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One could see that in places, it had become very uneven.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I went out alone into the road, and looked at the white muslin flag with the red rising sun in the center.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The flag and the black ribbon dangling by its side stood out in relief against the dirty grey of the thatch.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
A question that Sensei had once asked me suddenly came to my mind.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“What is your house like?” he had asked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“I wonder if the style of architecture in your part of the country is different from that in mine?” I wanted Sensei to see the old house where I was born.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But, at the same time, I felt a little ashamed of it.I went back to the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I sat at my desk, and as I read the newspaper, I thought of far-off Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I imagined this city, the greatest in all Japan, immersed in gloom, yet bustling with activity despite the darkness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was but one light shining, and that came from Sensei’s house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not know then that this light too would be swallowed up by the silent whirlpool.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not know that very soon, this light would be snuffed out, and that I would be left in a world of total darkness.Thinking that I would write to Sensei about the death of the Emperor, I picked up my pen.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After I had written ten lines or so, I decided not to write the letter after all.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I tore up the paper and threw the bits into the wastepaper basket.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
(I thought that it would be senseless to write to him about such a matter.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, I had little hope of getting a reply from him.)",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If only he would write to me, I thought, knowing that I had begun the letter simply out of loneliness.Some time towards the middle of August, I received a letter from a friend of mine, asking me if I would be interested in a post in a certain provincial secondary school.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This friend, through economic necessity, had been spending a great deal of his time looking for such posts for himself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The post had been offered to him, but since he had already accepted an offer from a school in a better district, he had been considerate enough to inform me of the opening.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wrote back immediately, saying that I was not interested, and suggesting that he write to a mutual friend of ours who, I knew, was desperately wanting a teaching post.After I had posted the letter, I told my parents of the opening.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They showed no displeasure when they heard that I had decided not to consider it.“Surely, there is no need for you to go to such a place,” they said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“You will get a better offer.”I began to suspect then that my parents had rather high hopes for my future.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And it soon became clear that in their ignorance, they were expecting their university-educated son to find an important position with a huge salary.“You must realize,” I said, “that good jobs are extremely hard to come by these days.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Please remember that my field of specialization is quite different from my elder brother’s.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Things have changed too since his day.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You mustn’t think that I am in the same happy situation as he was when he graduated.”“But you are a university graduate all the same,” said my father a little sullenly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“You mustn’t blame us if we now expect you to be financially independent.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It’s rather embarrassing, you know, not to have an answer when I am asked, ‘Now that your younger son has graduated, what is he going to do?’ ”The little community, of which my father had been a part for so many years, was his world, and he could not think beyond it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What he wanted me to do was find a position worthy of my qualifications, so that his reputation in the community would not be harmed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He did not wish to be embarrassed when his neighbors asked him: “I suppose your son will be earning a lot of money now that he has graduated from the university?” or “He will be earning about a hundred yen a month, perhaps?” To my parents, I, who was inclined to regard the great metropolis as my base of operations, must have seemed as weird as a creature that walked with its feet up in the air.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, I myself sometimes felt as alien to my surroundings as such a being would have done.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I decided to say nothing, rather than try to explain to them clearly what my feelings were.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The gulf between us was too great.“This is the sort of occasion when one tries to make use of one’s contacts,” said my mother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Now, what about this man Sensei that you are constantly talking about?”That was the extent of her understanding of my friendship with Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She could not be expected to see that though Sensei might advise me to make sure of my inheritance before my father died, he was not the sort of person that would go out of his way to help me find a position.“And what does this Sensei do?” asked my father.“He does nothing,” I replied.It was my impression that I had already told both my father and my mother that Sensei did nothing; and if I was not mistaken in thinking so, then my father should have remembered this.“Tell me,” said my father, not without sarcasm, “why is it that he does nothing?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One would think that such a man as he, whom you seem to respect so highly, would find some kind of employment.”What he really meant to say, it seemed to me, was that any man worth his salt would find some useful occupation, and that only a ne’er-do-well would be content to live in idleness.“True, I don’t earn a regular salary,” my father continued.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“But you must admit that even a simple fellow like me finds something to do.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No one can say that I do nothing.”I still remained silent.“If this man is as clever as you say he is,” said my mother, “then I’m sure he will find you a job.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Have you asked him?”“No,” I said.“Well now, that won’t do, will it?” said my mother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Why don’t you ask him?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Write him a letter.”“Yes,” I said half-heartedly, and left the room.It was obvious that my father was afraid of his illness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But he tried to keep his fears to himself, and whenever the doctor came, he did not bother him with senseless questions.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The doctor, in his turn, remained discreetly silent.My father seemed to be thinking about what would happen after his death.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was apparent at least that he often tried to picture to himself life in the house with him gone.“You know,” he once said to me, “There are advantages and disadvantages in having one’s children educated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You take the trouble to give them an education, and when they are through with their studies, they go away, and never come home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Why, you can almost say that education is a means of separating children from their parents.”Indeed, it was because my elder brother had received a university education that he had gone away to a distant province.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I too, because of my education, had resolved to live in Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was not unreasonable, then, that my father should complain about his children.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No doubt, it was very sad for him to imagine my mother left all alone in the country house where he had lived for so many years.For him, the house was the family home, and he would never have contemplated living anywhere else.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He took it for granted, too, that my mother would remain there until she died.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The thought, therefore, of my mother living in solitude in the big house gave him considerable anxiety.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That he should, at the same time, insist on my going to Tokyo to find a decent position struck me as being inconsistent.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
This inconsistency on his part amused me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Also, I welcomed it, since I could go to Tokyo with his full approval.I dared not allow my father and mother to think that I was not trying hard to find a post.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wrote to Sensei, and explained the situation at home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said that I was willing to do any kind of work so long as I was qualified for it, and asked him to help me find an opening somewhere.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wrote the letter believing that Sensei would take no notice of my request.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, I thought to myself, even if he wished to help me, he could do very little, since he led such a secluded life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was certain, however, that he would answer my letter.Before I sealed the letter, I went up to my mother and said:“See, I’ve written a letter to Sensei as you suggested.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Won’t you read it?”As I had expected, my mother did not read the letter.“Is that so?” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“In that case, you had better post it at once.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You should have written it much sooner.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
One shouldn’t have to be prodded to do these things.”My mother still treated me like a child.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To be truthful, I did feel rather childish then.“I should warn you, however,” I said, “that merely writing a letter won’t be enough.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I must go up to Tokyo—perhaps in September.”“That may be so, but it never does any harm to write to one’s friends first.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"How do you know that they won’t suddenly find something for you?”“Yes, of course.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Well, let us talk about it again when I get a letter from Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He is sure to write to me.”I believed that in such a matter, Sensei would be quite conscientious.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I waited confidently, therefore, to hear from him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I was disappointed.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A whole week passed, and there was no letter.“He has probably gone away on holiday,” I said to my mother, feeling that I should offer some sort of excuse for Sensei’s silence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was not only my mother, but myself also, that I was trying to convince.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For my own peace of mind, I had to explain to myself that Sensei would not have ignored my request without good reason.Sometimes I would forget my father’s illness, and toy with the idea of leaving immediately for Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father too seemed occasionally to forget that he was ill, and though he was not unaware of the need to set his affairs in order before his death, he did nothing about it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No opportunity ever arose for me to approach him about my share of the estate as Sensei had advised.Finally, at the beginning of September, I decided to go to Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I asked my father if he would continue sending me the allowance that I had received when I was at the university.“I must go,” I said, “if I am to find the kind of job that you have in mind for me.”I made it seem as though I wished to go to Tokyo merely to realize my father’s hopes for me.“Of course, I want the allowance only until I find a job.”Secretly, I felt that there was little chance of my finding a decent position.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But my father, who was somewhat removed from the realities of the world outside, firmly believed otherwise.“All right,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Since it will only be for a short time, I’ll see to it that you get your allowance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But only for a short time, mind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You must become independent as soon as you find employment.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It really isn’t right that one should, immediately after graduating, live on others.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It would seem that the younger generation today knows only how to spend money.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It doesn’t seem to occur to them that money has to be made too.”He said other things in his lecture to me, among them being: “In my day, parents were supported by their children.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Today, the children are supported forever by their parents.” I listened quietly.At last, the lecture seemed to be over, and I was about to get up when my father asked me when I intended to leave.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said that I should go as soon as possible.“Ask your mother to choose a propitious day for your departure, then,” said my father.“Yes, I’ll do that,” I said.I was being unusually obedient.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not want to anger my father before leaving home.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His last words to me, before I left the room, were: “With you gone, this house will seem lonely again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There will be no one but your mother and myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wish my health were better.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As it is, one can’t tell what will happen.”I comforted my father as well as I could, and then went back to my desk.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I sat down amongst my books, which were scattered all over the floor, and for a long time, I thought about my father’s plaintive words and the sadness in his eyes as he said them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could hear the cicadas singing outside.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
These were different from those that I had heard in the early part of the summer.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"These were the little ones, the tsuku-tsuku-boshi.1 Every summer, when I was home for the holidays, I would often sit and listen to the piercing song of the cicadas and find myself falling into a strangely sorrowful mood.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was as if sorrow crept into my heart with the cry of these insects.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I would stay absolutely still, thinking of my own loneliness.But that summer, the nature of my melancholy seemed gradually to change.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought often of the fate of those that I knew, and sometimes I wondered whether it was not like that of the large cicadas of early summer, which had so soon been replaced by the tsuku-tsuku-boshi.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought of my sorrowing father, and then of Sensei, who had not yet answered my letter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was natural that I should associate the two in my thoughts.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The contrast between them was so sharp that I could not think of one without thinking of the other.There was little that I did not know about my father.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The regret I would feel if we were parted would be no more than that of any son who was fond of his father.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, there was much that I did not know about Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He had not yet told me about his past, as he had promised.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In short, Sensei still remained for me a figure half-hidden in the shadows.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not be content until he was fully revealed to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not bear the thought of being parted from him before then.My mother consulted the calendar, and we decided on a propitious day for my departure.It was, I think, two days before I was due to leave that my father fainted once more.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was evening, and I had just finished roping up my trunk which was filled with books and clothing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My father had gone to take his bath.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My mother, who had followed him to scrub his back, suddenly called to me in a loud voice.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I found my father lying in my mother’s arms.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But as soon as he was back in his room, he said, “I’m all right now.” I sat down by his bed, however, and cooled his forehead with a wet cloth.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was nine o’clock before I was able to have a light snack, in lieu of the dinner I had missed.The next day he seemed better than we had expected.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Taking no notice of our remonstrances, he walked to the bathroom alone.“I’m all right now,” he would repeatedly say to me, as he had done the previous winter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then, he had been more or less all right as he had claimed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I thought hopefully that he might be proved right once more.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Despite persistent questioning, however, the doctor would tell me nothing, except that constant care was necessary.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The day which had been fixed for my departure arrived, but through anxiety for my father, I decided to postpone my trip to Tokyo.“I think I’ll stay until things are more certain,” I said to my mother.“Yes, please do,” she said imploringly.When my father had shown himself well enough to wander about the garden or the backyard, my mother had been unduly optimistic.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But now, she was more worried and nervous than I thought necessary.“Were you not going to Tokyo today?” asked my father later that day.“Yes, but I’ve decided to stay a little longer.”“Because of me?” he asked.I hesitated for a moment.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I said yes, I would be admitting that I thought his condition serious.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wanted to spare his feelings if could.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But he seemed to read my thoughts.“I am sorry,” he said, and turned towards the garden.I went back to my room, and stared at the trunk lying on the floor.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was tightly bound, all ready for my journey.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I stood before it for a while, wondering vaguely if I should start unpacking.Three or four days went by.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was in such an unsettled frame of mind that I felt rather like a man who was neither sitting down nor standing up.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My father then fainted again.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This time the doctor ordered absolute quiet.“What are we going to do?” said my mother in almost a whisper, so that my father would not hear.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She looked rather frightened and helpless.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was prepared to send telegrams to my elder brother and younger sister.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But my father, who was now confined to his bed, seemed hardly to be suffering at all.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To look at him and to hear him chatting, one would have said that he had nothing more serious than a cold.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, his appetite was even better than usual.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He would not listen to us whenever we warned him against overeating.“I am going to die anyway,” he once said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“I may as well eat all the delicacies while I can.”My father’s idea of a “delicacy” struck me as being at once comic and pathetic.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was not a townsman, and so did not know what real delicacies were.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Often, late at night, he would ask my mother for grilled rice cake, and eat it with gusto.“I wonder why he is always so parched?” my mother said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“It may very well be that there is still some strength left in him.”My poor mother had chosen the gravest of symptoms on which to pin her hopes.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She had however said parched,2 a word which in the old days meant hungry as well as thirsty, but only when applied to sick people.When my uncle called, my father would not let him go.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He wished him to stay mostly because he was lonely, of course, but I suspected also that he wanted someone to complain to about our reluctance to give him the kind of food he craved.My father’s condition remained the same for a week or so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"During that time, I wrote a long letter to my brother in Kyushu.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had my mother write to my sister.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I thought that this would probably be the last time we would be writing them about my father’s health.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For this reason, I saw to it that they were warned that the next time they received any communication from us, it would be in the form of a telegram asking them to come home.My brother was a busy man.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My sister was with child.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We could therefore not expect them to come home unless my father’s condition became really serious.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, we did not want them to go to all the trouble of coming to see him only to find that they were too late.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No one knew how much I worried over the problem of when to send the telegrams.“I can’t tell you precisely when the crisis will come,” said the doctor whom we had brought in from the nearest big town.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“All I can say is that it may come any time.”After talking it over with my mother, I decided to ask the doctor to send us a reliable nurse from the town hospital.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The nurse arrived, dressed in her white uniform, and when she presented herself to my father, he looked at her rather strangely.My father had known for some time that his disease was fatal.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But when at last death was very close, he seemed unable to recognize it.“When I am better,” he said, “I must go to Tokyo once more, and enjoy myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Who knows when any of us will die?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We should do all the things we want to do while we can.”There was nothing that my mother could say, except: “When you go, please take me with you.”But sometimes, my father would become very sad, and say: “When I die, please look after your mother.”I was then reminded of that evening at Sensei’s house, just after I had graduated, when Sensei had repeatedly used the phrase “when I die” in his wife’s presence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I remembered the smile on Sensei’s face as he said it, and how his wife had refused to listen any more, saying, “Please don’t say it again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It’s so unlucky.” Then, death had been simply a matter for speculation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But now, it was something that might soon become a reality.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not very well imitate Sensei’s wife.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I had to say something to divert my father’s mind from the thought of death.“Please don’t talk like that.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Remember, you are coming to Tokyo to enjoy yourself when you are better.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And mother is coming with you.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You will really be amazed to see how much Tokyo has changed since your last visit.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For example, the tram lines have become numerous, and you know how they affect the appearance of streets.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There’s been a rearrangement of the boroughs too.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Why, one can say that in Tokyo today, there’s not a moment of quiet, day or night.”Perhaps, in my anxiety to please my father, I chattered more than I should.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He seemed to enjoy listening to me, however.Owing to his illness, the number of visitors to our house increased.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Our relations living nearby came to see him frequently, perhaps at the rate of one every two days.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Even those relations who lived far away, and who had become estranged from us, were among the visitors.“Why,” said one of them, after he had seen my father, “he is much better than I thought.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am sure he will be all right.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He has no trouble talking, and his face isn’t any thinner.” Besides him, there were others who felt the same way about my father’s condition.Our household, which on my return had struck me as being almost too quiet, now became disturbingly busy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And my father, the only immobile figure in the growing commotion, became steadily worse.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After consulting my mother and my uncle, I decided to send the telegrams.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A reply came from my brother, saying that he would leave for home at once.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was a telegram from my brother-in-law, saying that he would be coming.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My sister had had a miscarriage in her previous pregnancy, and he had sworn that the next time, he would do everything possible to help prevent another such occurrence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We had thought it probable, therefore, that he would come alone.Despite the unsettling circumstances, however, I was able to enjoy moments of privacy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, I had even time enough to read ten pages of a book without interruption.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The trunk, once so carefully packed, was now lying open on the floor.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Every so often, I would go to it, and pull out a book that I happened to want.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Looking back on the daily schedule for the summer that I had set myself before leaving Tokyo, I decided that I had been able to complete only about one-third of the work that I should have done by then.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The unpleasant feeling that I had not worked hard enough was one that I had often experienced before, though only very rarely had I ever accomplished so little as I had that summer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was weighed down by the depressing thought that such perhaps was the normal state of things in every man’s life.Sitting thus unhappily, I thought again about my father’s illness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wondered how things would be after he was dead.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And once more, side by side with the image of my father, there appeared in my thoughts the image of Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"With my mind’s eye I gazed upon these two figures, so different from each other in position, in education, and in character.My mother looked in around the door of my room, and found me sitting amongst my scattered books with my arms folded.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had not long before left my father’s bedside.“Why don’t you take a nap?” she said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“You must be tired.”She could not see that I was not suffering from physical fatigue.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I was not such a child as to expect my mother to guess my mood.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I thanked her simply.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My mother still stood in the doorway.“How is father?” I asked.“He is sleeping quite soundly at the moment,” she said.Suddenly, she walked into the room and sat down by me.“Haven’t you heard from Sensei yet?” she asked.Before sending my letter to Sensei, I had assured her that he would definitely write back, and she had believed me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But even then, I did not think that Sensei would write the kind of reply that my father and mother were expecting.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In effect, I had knowingly lied to them.“Why don’t you write to him again?” she said.I was not the sort to begrudge my mother the little comfort that the writing of useless letters, no matter how many, might give her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was nevertheless painful for me to write to Sensei about such a matter.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I feared Sensei’s contempt far more than my father’s anger or my mother’s displeasure.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was indeed inclined to suspect that Sensei’s silence was due to his contempt for my request.“It’s easy enough to write letters,” I said, “but really, one can’t arrange such things by mail.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I must go to Tokyo and look around for myself.”“But with your father the way he is, there’s no knowing when you will be able to go to Tokyo.”“I do not intend to go to Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I intend to stay here, until we know what will become of him.”“I should say so!",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Who would ever think of going to Tokyo at a time like this, when he is so critically ill!”At first, I felt sorry for my mother who understood so little.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And then, I began to wonder why it was that she had chosen such a time to reopen the question of my future.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had myself been able to forget my father’s illness for a moment or two, and read and think in the privacy of my room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But did my mother, I wondered, have the same capacity to detach her thoughts from the invalid for a brief while, and worry about other things?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My mother began to speak again: “As a matter of fact .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".”“As a matter of fact, I can’t help thinking how much of a comfort it would be to your father if you could find a job.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, it may be too late now.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But as you can see, he can still talk without any trouble, and his mind is perfectly clear.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Won’t you be a good son,3 and try to make him happy before he gets any worse?”But the pity of it was that I could not be the good son my mother wished me to be.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not write so much as a line to Sensei.My father was reading the newspaper in bed when my elder brother arrived.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It had always been my father’s custom never to let anything prevent him from at least glancing through the newspaper.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But boredom, resulting from his confinement to bed, had made him more attached to it than ever.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Neither my mother nor I had objected too strongly, thinking it best to leave him with his favorite pastime.“I am glad to see you looking so well,” said my brother to my father.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I came here thinking that you must be really ill, but you look very well indeed.”My brother seemed to me too cheerful, and his bright tone a little out of place.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But later, when he had left my father and was alone with me, he seemed more depressed.“He shouldn’t be reading the paper like that, should he?” he said.“No, I don’t think he should either, but what can I do?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He insists on being allowed to see it”My brother listened to my excuses in silence.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then he said: “I wonder if he understands what he is reading?” He seemed to have decided that my father’s mind had been considerably dulled by his illness.“Certainly,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“He understands perfectly well.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Why, only a short time ago, I talked to him about all sorts of things for about twenty minutes, and it was obvious then that he was in full possession of his faculties.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At this rate, it is possible that he will be with us for quite a while yet.”My brother-in-law, who had arrived at about the same time as my brother, was more optimistic than any of us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father asked him many questions about my sister, and then said: “In her condition, it is wise to avoid such discomforts as a train journey.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I would have been worried, rather than pleased, had she gone to the trouble of coming to see me.” He then added: “After all, I can always visit her myself, when I am better, and have a good look at the baby.”My father was the first to see the news of General Nogi’s death4 in the paper.“What a terrible thing!” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“What a terrible thing!”We, who had not yet read the news, were startled by these exclamations.“I really did think he had finally gone mad,” said my brother later.“I must say I was surprised too,” agreed my brother-in-law.About that time, the papers were so full of unusual news that we in the country waited impatiently for their arrival.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I would read the news by my father’s bedside, taking care not to disturb him, or, if I could not do this, I would quietly retire into my own room, and there read the paper from beginning to end.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For a long time, the image of General Nogi in his uniform, and that of his wife dressed like a court lady, stayed with me.The tragic news touched us like the bitter wind which awakens the trees and the grass sleeping in the remotest corners of the countryside.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The incident was still fresh in our minds when, to my surprise, a telegram arrived from Sensei.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In a place where dogs barked at the sight of a Western-style suit, the arrival of a telegram was a great event.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My mother, to whom the telegram had been given, seemed to think it necessary to call me to a deserted part of the house before handing it to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Needless to say, she looked quite startled.“What is it?” she said, standing by while I opened it.It was a simple message, saying that he would like to see me if possible, and would I come up?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I cocked my head in puzzlement.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My mother offered an explanation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I am sure he wants to see you about a job,” she said.I thought that perhaps my mother was right.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, I could not quite believe that Sensei wanted to see me for that reason.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, I, who had sent for my brother and brother-in-law, could hardly abandon my sick father and go to Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My mother and I decided that I should send Sensei a telegram saying that I could not come.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I explained as briefly as possible that my father’s condition was becoming more and more critical.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I felt, however, that I owed him a fuller explanation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That same day, I wrote him a letter giving him the details.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My mother, who was firmly convinced that Sensei had some post in mind for me, said in a tone filled with regret, “What a pity that this should have happened at such a time.”The letter that I wrote was quite a long one.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Both my mother and I thought that this time, Sensei would write in reply.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then two days after I had posted my letter, another telegram arrived for me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It said that I need not come, and no more.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I showed it to my mother.“I think that he will soon be writing to you about it,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It never occurred to her that Sensei might have had something other than my future livelihood in mind when he sent me his first telegram.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And though I thought that my mother might possibly be right, I could not but feel that it was not like Sensei to go to the trouble of finding me a job.“Of course,” I said, pointing to the second telegram, “Sensei cannot have received my letter yet.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
So he sent this without having read the letter.”My mother listened in all seriousness as I stated this obvious fact.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Yes, that is so,” she said, after some careful thought.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Needless to say, the fact that Sensei had not yet received my letter when he sent his second telegram was no indication as to why he had sent the telegrams at all.We spoke no more about Sensei and his telegrams that day, since we were expecting our regular doctor to come with the chief physician of the town hospital.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remember that the two doctors, after examining my father, decided that he should be given an enema.For the first few days after the doctor had ordered him to stay in bed, my father had found it particularly galling not to be able to go to the bathroom.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But gradually, he seemed to lose his habitual sense of propriety.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As his condition grew worse, he became more uninhibited.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At times, it seemed that he had lost all sense of shame in the matter of bodily functions.His appetite slowly decreased.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Even when he desired food, he found that he could only swallow a small amount.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His strength went too, and he could no longer hold the newspaper that he loved so much.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His spectacles, which still lay beside his pillow, now remained always in their black case.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When a childhood friend of his whom we all called Saku-san, and who lived about three miles away from us, came to see him, he turned his lackluster eyes towards his friend and said, “Oh, it is you, Sakusan.”“It was good of you to come, Saku-san.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I envy you your good health.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am finished.”“Come now, you must not say such things.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You may be suffering from a slight illness, it is true, but what have you really to complain about?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You have two sons with university degrees, haven’t you?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Look at me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My wife is dead, and I have no children.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am leading a meaningless existence.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I may be healthy, but what have I to look forward to?”It was two or three days after Saku-san’s visit that my father was given the enema.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was very pleased, saying that thanks to the doctors, he felt comfortable once more.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He became more cheerful, as though he had regained confidence in his power to recover.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whether my mother was deceived into thinking that he was indeed getting better, or whether she was merely trying to encourage him, I do not know; but at any rate, she told him about the telegrams from Sensei and talked as though a post had been found for me in Tokyo as he had hoped.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was sitting beside my mother then, and though I felt uneasy, I could not very well interrupt her, and so I listened to her in silence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father looked pleased.“That’s very good,” said my brother-in-law.“But don’t you know yet what sort of a job it is?” asked my brother.It was too late to tell the truth.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I lacked the courage.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I made a vague remark, so vague that I myself did not know its meaning, and abruptly left the room.My father’s illness advanced to the point where death was but another step away, and there it seemed to linger awhile.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Every night, we went to bed thinking, “Will death wait another day, or is it to be tonight?”He was not in great pain, and we were thus spared the strain of having to watch him suffer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From this point of view, nursing him was a relatively easy task.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, each one of us in turn stayed up at night to keep watch over him, but the rest of us were free to go to bed at a reasonable hour.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One night, it so happened that I found difficulty in going to sleep.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As I lay in my bed, I thought that I heard the faint sound of my father groaning.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To make sure that there was nothing amiss, I got up and went to his room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was my mother’s turn to stay up that night.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I found her asleep on the floor by his bedside, with her head resting on her bent arm.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father was absolutely still, as though someone had gently lowered him into a world of deep sleep.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Softly, I went back to my bed.My brother and I slept under the same mosquito net.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But my brother-in-law, perhaps because he was regarded as a guest, slept alone in a separate room.“It’s rather hard on poor Seki-san,” said my brother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“He has been kept away from home for days now.” “Seki” was the surname of our brother-in-law.“But he isn’t a very busy man,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“That’s probably why he’s been good enough to remain here.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Surely it must be far more inconvenient for you than it is for him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You can’t have expected to stay so long.”“True, but there’s nothing one can do about it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At a time like this, one can’t start worrying about one’s own affairs.”Lying in bed, we would talk thus before going to sleep.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We both thought that there was no hope for our father.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And sometimes, the thought would enter our minds that since he was doomed, it would be better if the end came quickly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In a manner of speaking, the two sons were waiting for their parent to die.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But we, as sons, could not in all decency openly express our thoughts, though each of us knew fully well what the other was thinking.“It would seem that father intends to get better,” said my brother to me.My brother’s opinion was not entirely unfounded.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whenever a neighbor came to our house, my father would invariably insist on seeing him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And then he would be sure to express his regret to the visitor that he had been unable to hold the graduation party in my honor as planned.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, he would add that when he got better, the visitor would certainly receive another invitation from him.“It’s just as well that the party was cancelled,” said my brother, reminding me of his own unfortunate experience.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“You’re a very lucky fellow.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As for me, I had a terrible time of it.” I smiled sourly to myself as I remembered how disorderly and drunken the evening had been.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I remembered, with bitterness, how my father had gone around forcing food and drink on his guests.There had never been much brotherly love between us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We had fought a great deal when we were children, and I, being the younger, had invariably left the fight in tears.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Again, the fact that we had studied different subjects at the university was an indication of the difference in our characters.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I was at the university, and especially after my meeting with Sensei, I used to regard my brother from afar and pronounce him a kind of animal.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was then living far away from me, and we had not seen each other for some years.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We had become alienated by both distance and time.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Nevertheless, when we met again after so long a separation, we found ourselves being drawn together by a gentle, brotherly feeling which seemed to come naturally from I know not where.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No doubt, the circumstances of our reunion had much to do with it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We had, so to speak, clasped each other by the hand over the dying body of one who was father to us both.“What are your plans for the future?” asked my brother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I answered him with a question of my own:“I wonder what has been decided about the family property?”“I have no idea.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Father has so far said nothing about it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In terms of cash, I don’t suppose our property is worth very much.”As for my mother, she waited anxiously for the arrival of Sensei’s reply.“Haven’t you heard from him yet?” she would say reproachfully.“Who is this ‘Sensei,’ that I keep hearing about?” asked my brother.“Why, I told you about him only the other day,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was annoyed at him for so quickly forgetting what he had been told in answer to his own questions.“You did tell me, it’s true, but .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.”What he meant to say of course was that Sensei was still a mystery to him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It should have mattered very little to me whether he understood Sensei or not.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was nevertheless angry, and began to think that my brother, after all, had not changed very much.To his way of thinking, this man that I so admiringly referred to as “Sensei” must necessarily be a man of some importance and reputation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He was inclined to imagine that Sensei was at the very least a university lecturer.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In this, he was no different from my father.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He found it impossible to believe, and so did my father, that a man who was not known and did nothing could amount to very much.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But while my father was quick to assume that only those with no ability at all would live in idleness, my brother seemed to think that men who refused to make use of their talents were worthless characters.“That’s the trouble with egoists,”5 he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“They are brazen enough to think they have the right to live idly.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It’s a crime not to make the best use of whatever ability one has.”I was tempted to ask my brother if he knew what he was talking about when he used the word “egoist.”“But one mustn’t grumble,” he went on to say.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Fortunately, it seems that he has found a job for you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Father is very pleased about that.”Without definite word from Sensei, I could hardly share my brother’s optimism regarding my future.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I had not the courage to say what I really thought.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My mother had indeed been very rash when she announced that Sensei was willing to help me, but it was now too late for me to say so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was as eager as my mother was to hear from Sensei.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I prayed that the letter, when it came, would live up to my family’s expectations.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought of my father, who was so close to dying; of my mother, who so desperately wanted to give him as much comfort as she could; of my brother, who seemed to think that not to work for one’s living was hardly human; and of my brother-in-law, my uncle, my aunt—and I asked myself, “What will they all think of me, if Sensei has done nothing?” What was of itself quite unimportant to me, began to worry me terribly.When my father vomited some strange, yellow matter, I remembered Sensei’s and his wife’s warnings.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“He has been lying in his bed for so long, no wonder his stomach is upset,” said my mother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not help the tears in my eyes as I looked at her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She understood so little.My brother and I met in the morning room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Did you hear?” he said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He was asking whether I had heard what the doctor said to him before leaving.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was no need for my brother to say more, for I knew.“Do you think you can settle down here, and take over the house?” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I said nothing.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My brother continued:“Mother can hardly manage things by herself, can she?” The prospect of my slowly crumbling away with the odor of earth clinging to me bothered him very little.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“If all you want to do is read books, then you can do that well enough here.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, you won’t have to do any work.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I should think the life would suit you very well.”“It would be more proper if you, being the elder brother, came home,” I said.“How can I do a thing like that?” he said crossly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My ambitious brother, I knew, was quite convinced that his promising career had just begun.“Well, if you don’t want to, I suppose we can always ask our uncle to manage our affairs for us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But even so, someone will have to look after mother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She will have to live with either you or me.”“That’s the problem,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Will she ever agree to leave this house?”And so, while their father was still alive, the two brothers talked of what they would do after his death.My father began to talk deliriously.“Will General Nogi ever forgive me?” he would say.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“How can I ever face him without shame?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Yes, General, I will be with you very soon.”When he said such things, my mother would become a little frightened, and would ask us to gather around the bed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father too, when he came out of his delirium, seemed to want everybody by his side so as not to feel lonely.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He would want my mother most of all.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He would look around the room, and if she was not there, he would be sure to ask, “Where is Omitsu?” Even when he did not say so, his eyes would ask the question.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Often, I had to get up and find her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She would then leave her work, and enter the sickroom saying, “Is there anything you wish?” There were times when he would say nothing, and simply look at her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There were also times when he would say something quite unexpectedly gentle, such as: “I’ve given you a lot of trouble, haven’t I, Omitsu?” And my mother’s eyes would suddenly fill with tears.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Afterwards, she would remember how different he used to be in the old days, and say, “Of course, he sounds rather helpless now, but he used to be quite frightening, I can tell you.”Among the tales she was fond of telling was the one about the time he had beaten her back with a broomstick.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We had often heard the tale before, but now we listened more carefully, as though the tale was a keepsake to be treasured.Even when death was casting its dark-grey shadow over my father’s eyes, he said nothing about a will.“Don’t you think we should speak to him about it before it’s too late?” said my brother.“Well, I don’t know,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was not so sure that to force my father to consider such a matter at this stage would be right.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally, we went to our uncle for advice.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was also hesitant.“Of course, if he did have anything on his mind, it would be a pity to let him die without telling us about it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, perhaps it would be wrong of us to bring up the subject.”Before we could reach a decision, my father fell into a coma.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My mother, in her usual way, failed to see what had really happened.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She was indeed very pleased, thinking that my father was sleeping peacefully.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Thank goodness he is still able to sleep like that,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“We can now relax.”My father would open his eyes from time to time, and would suddenly ask what had happened to so-and-so, referring always to someone who had been by his bedside in his last lucid period.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It seemed that my father’s understanding, like a white thread running through black material, was continuous though broken at intervals by patches of total darkness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was not surprising that my mother should mistake his coma for natural sleep.My father began to lose his power of speech.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Often, his sentences would trail off into incoherent mumbling and we would fail completely to understand what he was trying to say.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"However, he would start each sentence in a voice stronger than one would have believed possible in one so ill. Also, he could no longer hear very well, and we were obliged to speak loudly into his ear.“Would you like me to cool your head?”“Yes.”With the help of the nurse, I renewed the water in the rubber pillow, and placed a bag of newly crushed ice on his forehead.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I placed it gently, so that the sharp points of the ice would not hurt him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At that moment, my brother came into the room from the corridor, and without saying a word, handed me a letter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Much intrigued, I took the letter with my free hand.It was very heavy, and too bulky to fit into an ordinary envelope.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was wrapped in a sheet of strong writing-paper, which had been carefully folded and sealed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I noticed at once that it was a registered letter.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I turned it over, I saw Sensei’s name written in a restrained hand.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was too busy to open the letter just then, and so I put it into my pocket.That day, my father’s condition seemed to be very much worse.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I left his bedside to go to the bathroom, and on my way there I met my brother in the corridor.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Where are you going?” he said, sounding rather like a sentry on duty.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“He looks very bad, you know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You must try to stay with him as much as possible.”My brother was quite right.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Leaving the letter unopened in my pocket, I went back to the sickroom.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father opened his eyes, and asked my mother for the names of all those sitting around him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At the mention of each name, my father nodded, and when he seemed not to hear, my mother repeated the name loudly, saying, “Did you hear?”My father said, “You have all been very kind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Thank you very much.” Then again he fell into a coma.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In silence, the people sitting around the dying man watched him for a while.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then one of the group got up, and went into the adjoining room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Shortly after, another got up and left.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The third to go was myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I went back to my room with the intention of opening the letter there.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No doubt, I could quite easily have done so while sitting with my father.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But the letter, judging by its weight, was obviously very long, and I could not have read it through in the sickroom without interruption.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had been waiting for such an opportunity as this to read it undisturbed in my own room.Almost violently, I tore open the tough paper which contained the letter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The letter had the appearance of a manuscript, with the characters neatly written between vertically ruled lines.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I smoothed out the sheets which had been folded over twice for easier handling in the post.I could not but wonder what it was that Sensei had written at such great length.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was, however, too much on edge to read the whole letter properly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My mind kept wandering back to the sickroom.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had the feeling that something would happen to my father before I could finish reading the letter.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At least, I was sure that I would soon be called away by my brother, or my mother, or my uncle.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In this unsettled state, I read the first page.“You asked me once to tell you of my past.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not have the courage then to do so.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But now, I believe I am free of the bonds that prevented me from telling you the truth about myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The freedom that I now have, however, is no more than an earthly, physical kind of freedom, which will not last forever.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Unless I take advantage of it while I can, I shall never again have the opportunity of passing on to you what I have learned from my own experience, and my promise to you will have been broken.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Circumstances having prevented me from telling you my story in person, I have decided to write it out for you.”I read thus far, and realized why it was that the letter was so long.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That Sensei would not bother to write me about my future career, I had more or less known from the very beginning.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What really worried me was that Sensei, who hated to write at all, had taken the trouble to write such a long epistle.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Why had he not waited, I asked myself, until I was once more in Tokyo?I said to myself repeatedly, “He is free now, but he will never be free again,” and tried desperately to understand what the words meant; then all of a sudden I became uneasy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I tried to read on further, but before I could do so, I heard my brother’s voice calling me from the sickroom.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Frightened, I stood up, and hurried along the corridor to where the others were gathered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was prepared to learn that the end had come for my father.During my absence from the room, the doctor had arrived.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In an attempt to make my father more comfortable, he was about to give him an enema.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The nurse, tired from the previous night’s vigil, had gone to the next room to sleep.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My brother, who was not used to helping on such occasions, seemed at a loss.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When he saw me enter, he said, “Here, give us a hand,” and promptly sat down.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I took his place, and helped the doctor.My father’s condition seemed to improve a little.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The doctor remained for another half-hour or so, then satisfied as to the results of the enema, he stood up to go.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was careful to tell us before leaving that if anything did happen, we should not hesitate to call him.Once more I left the room with its atmosphere of approaching death, and returned to my own.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There I tried again to read the letter.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I was too nervous.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No sooner had I sat down at my desk than I was overcome by fear lest I should hear my brother’s loud voice summoning me to the sickroom, perhaps for the last time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I turned the pages over mechanically, not taking in the meaning of the characters so neatly written along the ruled lines.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not even grasp the gist of the letter.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally I reached the last page, and was about to fold up the letter again and put it on the desk when suddenly a sentence near the end caught my eye.“By the time this letter reaches you, I shall probably have left this world—I shall in all likelihood be dead.”I was stunned.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My heart, which had till then been so restless, seemed suddenly to freeze.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Hurriedly, I began to turn the pages over backwards, reading a sentence here and there.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I tried desperately to pin down the words which seemed to dance before my eyes.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
All I wanted to know at that moment was that Sensei was still alive.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sensei’s past, his dark past that he had promised to tell me about, held no interest for me then.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I could not find what I was seeking, and I refolded the letter in exasperation.I returned to the doorway of my father’s room to see how he was doing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The room was surprisingly quiet.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was only my mother sitting by the bedside, looking tired and forlorn.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I beckoned her, and when she came to me, I asked, “How is he?” She said, “He seems to be holding out.” I went up to my father, and putting my face close to his, I said, “How do you feel?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Has the enema made you more comfortable?” He nodded, and then said quite distinctly, “Thank you.” His mind seemed unexpectedly clear.Once more, I returned to my room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I looked at my watch, and began to examine the railway timetable.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I then stood up, rearranged my dress, and putting Sensei’s letter in my pocket, went out through the back door.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As though in a nightmare, I ran to the doctor’s house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wanted to ask the doctor whether my father would last another two or three days.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wanted to beg him to keep my father alive for a few days more, by injection or any other means in his power.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The doctor was unfortunately out.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had not the time to wait for him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In any case, I was too agitated to stay still.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I jumped into a rickshaw and urged the man to hurry to the station.At the station, I scribbled a hurried note to my mother and brother, and asked the rickshaw man to take it quickly to the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I thought that it would be better to write even such a note than to leave without any word at all.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Thus, in a desperate desire to act, I boarded the Tokyo-bound train.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The noise of the engine filled my ears as I sat down in a third-class carriage.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At last, I was able to read Sensei’s letter from beginning to end.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"* * *1 This name is supposed to resemble their song.2 The Japanese word here is kawaku, which today means “to be thirsty,” and not “to be hungry.”3 The word in the Japanese text is oya-koko, which means filial piety.4 See translator’s Foreword.5 He uses the English word, and pronounces it igoisto.Part ThreeSensei and His TestamentI RECEIVED two or three letters from you this summer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I remember rightly, it was in your second letter that you asked me to help you find a suitable post.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I read it, I felt that the least I could do was to answer your letter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I must confess that in the end, I did nothing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As you know, my circle of acquaintances is very small.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, it would be more correct to say that I live alone in this world.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"How could I, then, have been of any help to you?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"However, that is of little importance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You see, when your letter came, I was trying desperately to decide what I should do with myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was thinking, “Should I go on living as I do now, like a mummy left in the midst of living beings, or should I .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"?” In those days, every time I thought of the latter alternative, I was seized with a terrible fear.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was like a man who runs to the edge of a cliff, and looking down, sees that the abyss is bottomless.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was a coward.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And like most cowards, I suffered because I could not decide.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Unfortunately, it would not be an exaggeration to say that at the time I was hardly aware of your existence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To go further, such a matter as your future livelihood was to me almost totally without significance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not care what you did.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was not, to my way of thinking, worth all the fuss.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I put your letter in the letter rack, and continued to worry about my own problem.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One brief and contemptuous glance in your direction, that is about all I thought you deserved.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Why should a fellow, I asked myself, as comfortably placed as you, start whining for a job so soon after graduating?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It is because I feel that I owe you some sort of explanation for my conduct, that I tell you all this.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am not being purposely rude in order to anger you.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I believe that you will understand when you have read my letter.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, I should have at least acknowledged your letter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Please forgive me for my negligence.Some time later, I sent you a telegram.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To tell you the truth, I simply wanted to see you again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Also, I wanted to tell you the story of my past as you had once asked me to.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When your telegram came, saying that you could not come to Tokyo, I was deeply disappointed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remember I sat still for a while, staring at it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You too must have felt that a telegram was not enough, for you kindly wrote me a letter soon afterwards.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The letter made it quite clear why you could not come to Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had no reason to resent your not complying with my request.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
How could you have left home with your own father so ill?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was I who was at fault.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I should have remembered your father’s condition.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As a matter of fact, when I sent you that telegram, I had forgotten all about him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I, who had previously warned you of the seriousness of his illness, could not remember .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You see, I am an inconsistent person.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
This inconsistency may not be so much a natural part of my character as the effect that the remembrance of my own past has had on me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, I am well aware of my failing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You must forgive me.When I read your letter—your last letter to me—I realized I had done wrong.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought I would write to you, and say so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I went so far as to pick up my pen, but in the end, put it back on the desk without writing a single line.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The truth is, the only things I would have thought worth saying at the time are those things which I shall say here, and it was then too soon for me to write such a letter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That is why I sent you that simple telegram, telling you that there was no need to come.I began then to write this letter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am not accustomed to writing, and it pained me much to find that many of the incidents and my own thoughts I could not describe as freely as I wished.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Often, I was tempted to abandon the task, and so break my promise to you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But every time I dropped my pen thinking I could not go on, I found that before a full hour had passed, I was writing once more.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You may take this as a manifestation of my naturally strong sense of obligation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I will not contradict you if you do.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As you know, I have led a very secluded life, and have had little contact with the outside world.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As I look about me, I find that I really have no obligations.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Either through force of circumstances or through my own designing, I have lived in such a way as to free my life of obligation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But this is not because I have not it in me to feel a sense of obligation towards others.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Rather, it is because I feel it so sharply that I have led such a negative kind of life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am not strong enough to bear the pains that it inflicts on one.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You will understand, then, that if I had not kept my promise to you, I should have felt very uneasy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The desire to avoid such uneasiness was in itself enough to make me pick up my pen again.But that is not the only reason why I wanted to write this.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You see, apart from any sense of obligation, there is the simple reason that I want to write about my past.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Since my past was experienced only by me, I might be excused if I regarded it as my property, and mine alone.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And is it not natural that I should want to give this thing, which is mine, to someone before I die?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At least, that is how I feel.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, I would rather see it destroyed, with my life, than offer it to someone who does not want it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In truth, if there had not been such a person as you, my past would never have become known, even indirectly, to anyone.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To you alone, then, among the millions of Japanese, I wish to tell my past.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For you are sincere; and because once you said in all sincerity that you wished to learn from life itself.Without hesitation, I am about to force you into the shadows of this dark world of ours.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But you must not fear.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Gaze steadily into the shadows, and then take whatever will be of use to you in your own life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I speak of darkness, I mean moral darkness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For I was born an ethical creature, and I was brought up to be an ethical man.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, my ethics may be different from those of the young men of today.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But they are at least my own.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not borrow them for the sake of convenience as a man might a dress suit.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It is for this reason that I think you, who wish to grow, may learn something from my experience.You will remember how you used to try to argue with me about contemporary ideas.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You will remember too what my attitude was.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Though I did not exactly disdain your opinions, I must admit I could not bring myself to respect them either.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Your thoughts were without solid foundation, and you were too young to have had much experience.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, I laughed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, you used to look at me discontentedly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In the end, you asked me to spread out my past like a picture scroll before your eyes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then, for the first time, I respected you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was moved by your decision, albeit discourteous in expression, to grasp something that was alive within my soul.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You wished to cut open my heart, and see the blood flow.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was then still alive.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not want to die.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That is why I refused you, and postponed the granting of your wish to another day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Now, I myself am about to cut open my own heart, and drench your face with my blood.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I shall be satisfied if, when my heart stops beating, a new life lodges itself in your breast.I was not yet twenty when I lost both my parents.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I think that my wife once mentioned to you that they died of the same disease.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Also, if I remember correctly, she told you, much to your surprise, that they died almost at the same time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father, to tell the truth, was killed by that dreadful disease, typhoid; and my mother, who was nursing him, caught it from him.I was their only son.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Our family was well off, and so I was brought up in an atmosphere of generosity and ease.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As I look back on my past, I cannot but feel that had my parents—or at least one of them—survived, I might have been allowed to keep my generous nature.I was left behind alone, helpless as a lost child.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was inexperienced, and knew nothing of the ways of the world.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My mother could not be with my father when he died.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And when my mother was dying, she was not told that my father was already dead.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I do not know whether she knew, or whether she actually believed us when we told her that he was recovering.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
All I know is that she asked my uncle to take care of everything.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was there at the time: she nodded towards me, and said to my uncle, “Please look after my child.” It would seem that she wanted to say much more, but she succeeded only in saying, “.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
to Tokyo .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".” My uncle quickly said, “All right.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You mustn’t worry.” It may be that my mother’s constitution did not succumb too easily to fever, but at any rate, my uncle later said to me praisingly, “She’s a brave woman.” I do not know whether those few words of my mother’s were her last or not.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She of course knew the terrible nature of her own disease, and that she had caught it from my father.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I am by no means certain that she truly believed that she would die from it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And no matter how clear those words which she spoke in high fever might have been, they often left no trace in her memory when the fever subsided.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That is why I .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
but never mind.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What I am trying to say is that even then I was beginning to show signs of a deeply suspicious nature which could not accept anything without closely analyzing it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Irrelevant as the above account may be to the main part of my narrative, I feel that it will help you to understand one side of my character.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Please read all such passages, then, in this light.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This nature of mine led me not only to suspect the motives of individual persons but to doubt even the integrity of all mankind, and to what extent it increased my capacity for suffering you will see for yourself.I have digressed enough.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Considering my situation, I am really quite calm.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Even the sound of trams, which seems to become audible only when the rest of the world has gone to sleep, I can hear no more.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The forlorn singing of the insects reaches me through the closed shutters, and one feels that their song is of the dews of coming autumn.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My wife sleeps innocently in the next room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The pen in my hand makes a faint scratching sound as it traces one character after another down the page.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My heart is tranquil as I sit before my desk.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If the strokes of my characters seem sometimes ill-arranged, you must not think this due to my mental state.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Attribute it, rather, to my inexperience with the pen.At any rate, I, who was left alone, had no choice but to rely on my uncle in accordance with my mother’s wishes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My uncle, on his part, accepted full responsibility and looked after my affairs.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And he arranged, as I had hoped, for me to go to Tokyo.I came to Tokyo and entered the college.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
College students in those days were considerably more violent and barbaric than they are now.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One student I knew, for example, got into a fight with an apprentice one night and hurt him rather badly on the head with his wooden clogs.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He had been drinking, and so did not see the other fellow taking his college cap from him in the midst of the violent fight.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His name, of course, was carefully written on a label inside the cap.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The police were ready to report him to the college, but thanks to the intercession of his friends, the matter was prevented from becoming public.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You went to college in more gentle days, and so you must feel contempt for such rough doings.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I also, when I look back on those days, feel that we were all pretty silly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was, however, a certain kind of admirable simplicity in the life of the student then which one does not find today.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My monthly allowance, which my uncle sent me, was considerably less than what your father used to send you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"(Of course, the cost of living has gone up since my student days.)",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I do not remember wanting any more money than I received.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, my financial position was such that there was no reason for me to envy my classmates.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I think of it, it is likely that many of them envied me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In addition to my regular allowance, I used to receive allowances for books—I was already fond of buying books—and for incidental expenses which I spent freely.Being innocent, I not only trusted my uncle completely, but admired him and even considered myself indebted to him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He was a business man.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was also, at one time, a member of the prefectural assembly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I seem to remember that through his membership in the assembly, he had connections with some political party.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Though he and my father were brothers, it would seem that their characters developed in quite different directions.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father was a simple, upright man, whose main purpose in life was to keep intact the property left him by his ancestors.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He took pleasure in the tea ceremony and in the arrangement of flowers, and he loved to read poetry.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Paintings and antiques seemed to interest him too.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Our house was in the country, and I remember that a dealer from the town used to visit my father, bringing with him paintings, incense burners, and so on.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"(The town was about six miles away, and it was there that my uncle lived.)",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father was, I suppose, what one might call a “man of means,”1 a country gentleman of taste.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was, therefore, quite a contrast between him and his active, worldly brother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Oddly enough, they seemed quite fond of each other.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My father would often speak of my uncle in glowing terms, saying what a sound fellow he was, and how superior his brother’s qualities were to his own.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“The trouble with inheriting money from one’s parents,” he once said to my mother and to me, “is that it dulls one’s wits.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It’s a bad thing not to have to struggle for one’s living.” I believe that he said this for my benefit.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At least, he gave me a meaningful look at the time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That is why I remember his words so well.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"How could I doubt this uncle of mine, whom my father trusted and admired so much?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was natural that I should be proud of him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And when my father and mother died, he became more than someone to be proud of: he became a necessity.When I went home the following summer, my uncle had already moved into our house with his family, and was now its new master.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
This had been arranged between us before I left for Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"So long as I was not going to be in the house all the time, some such arrangement was necessary.My uncle was at that time connected with many business enterprises in the town.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remember that when we agreed that he should move into the house and manage the property during my absence, he said to me with a smile: “Of course, from the point of view of my own business, it would be much more convenient to live in my own house than to live six miles from town.” My house had a long history, and was not unknown in the district.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In the country, as you are probably well aware, it is a very serious thing to tear down or sell a house with a long tradition when there is an heir.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Such things do not worry me now, but I was young then, and I was torn between the desire to go to Tokyo and the fear of shirking the responsibility of my inheritance.Unwillingly, my uncle consented to move into my house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He insisted, however, that he be allowed to keep his old residence in town so that he might stay there whenever it was necessary.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Naturally, I had no objections: I was willing to agree to any arrangement which would enable me to go to Tokyo.As a child will, I loved my home; and when parted from it, there was a yearning for it in my heart.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was like a traveler who, no matter where he goes, never doubts that he will some day return to his place of birth.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I came to Tokyo of my own free will, but I had little doubt that I should return when the holidays came.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And so I studied and played in the great city, dreaming often of my home.I have no idea how my uncle divided his time between the two residences during my absence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, when I arrived, he and his whole family were living in my house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I suppose that those of his children who were still at school lived normally in the town house, but had been brought to our house in the country for the holidays.They were all pleased to see me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was pleased too, for the house had become a gay place; much gayer certainly than when my parents were alive.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My uncle chased out his eldest son who had taken over my own room, and put me in it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I objected, saying that since the house was so crowded, I did not mind staying in some other room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But my uncle would not listen: “This is your house, after all,” he said.There were unhappy moments when I thought of my father and mother, but on the whole, I had an enjoyable summer with my uncle’s family.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was one thing, however, which cast a slight shadow on my memory of the summer: my uncle and aunt had more than once tried to persuade me, who had only just entered college, to marry.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The first time they mentioned marriage to me, I was somewhat shocked, for the subject had been introduced suddenly; the second time, I positively refused to consider it; and the third time, I was forced to ask them why they wanted to discuss such a thing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The reason they gave was quite simple: I should, they said, get married as soon as possible and succeed my father.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I myself had been under the happy impression that so long as I came home for the holidays, all would be well.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, I was too well acquainted with the ways of the country not to see the reasonableness of my uncle’s wish that I should get married and settle down properly as my father’s heir.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, I do not think that I really disliked the prospect; but I had only recently begun my studies at college, and it was no more real to me than a distant scene observed from the wrong end of a telescope.I forgot all about the subject of marriage.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
None of the young men in my group seemed to me to have that domesticated look.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They all seemed to do as they liked, and, as far as I could tell, were all bachelors.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It is possible that if one had examined their personal histories carefully, one might have discovered that despite their easygoing ways, some of them had already been forced into marriage; but I was too young to even suspect such a thing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, even if there had been such men in our midst, it is doubtful that they would have wanted to talk about marriage, a subject far removed from the thoughts of young students.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To think of it, I was myself in this position; but I was not worried, and managed to spend another year happily at the college.At the end of that academic year, I packed my bag once more and returned to my parents’ resting place.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In my house, where once my father and mother had lived, I saw the cheerful faces of my uncle and his family.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Again I was able to breathe the air of my native place, which was as dear to me then as it ever was before.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was good to be back after a year of student life.But I was not allowed to enjoy for long the familiar surroundings which had become almost a part of me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once more, my uncle brought up the subject of marriage.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His reasons for wanting to see me get married were the same as those he gave the previous year.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But this time, he had someone in mind for me, which made the matter all the more embarrassing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The person that he suggested as a suitable bride was his own daughter, my cousin.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“It will be a convenient arrangement for both parties,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Your father, before he died, seemed to be of the same opinion.” I could myself see the convenience of such a union; and I could quite easily believe that my father had been in agreement with my uncle.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But the idea of marrying my cousin had never crossed my mind before, and had my uncle not pointed out the advantages of the marriage, they would certainly have never occurred to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was therefore surprised; yet I had to admit to myself the reasonableness of my uncle’s wishes.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Perhaps I am a thoughtless sort of person.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, I believe that the main source of my reluctance to marry my cousin lay in my complete indifference to her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
As a child I had frequently gone to play at my uncle’s home in town.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I remember that I often spent the night there.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My cousin and I were therefore childhood friends.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You know of course that a brother does not fall in love with his sister.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I may be simply repeating what has always been known, but I do believe that for love to grow there must first be the impact of novelty.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Between two people who have always known each other, that necessary stimulus can never be felt.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Like the first whiff of burning incense, or like the taste of one’s first cup of saké, there is in love that moment when all its power is felt.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There may be fondness, but not love, between two people who have come to know each other well without ever having grasped that moment.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No matter how hard I tried, I could not bring myself to want my cousin for a wife.My uncle said that if I should insist, he would be willing to postpone my wedding until I had graduated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“But,” he added, “as the saying goes, ‘don’t put off the good things.’ I should like, if possible, to announce the engagement now.” As far as I was concerned, a fiancé was no more desirable than a wife; and so I refused.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My uncle pulled a sour face.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My cousin cried; not because she was saddened by the prospect of a life without me, but because her woman’s pride had been hurt by my refusal to marry her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I knew very well that she was no more in love with me than I was with her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I returned once more to Tokyo.The following summer, I went home for the third time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had as usual awaited the end of the examinations impatiently, and then had hurried away from Tokyo as quickly as I could.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Home was indeed very dear to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You know of course that the very air of one’s native place seems different from that of anywhere else.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The smell of the earth, even, seems to have a special quality of its own.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, I found there to comfort me the tender memory of my father and mother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I looked forward to the months of July and August, when I could live like a snake hibernating in its hole, secure and comfortable in familiar surroundings.I was so simple as to think that the question of marriage between my cousin and myself had been settled, and that there was no more need for me to worry about it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I believed that in life, so long as one rejected openly what one did not want, one would be left alone.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And so the fact that I had not yielded to my uncle’s persuasion worried me very little.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After having spent a year without giving it much thought, I went home in my usual cheerful mood.My uncle’s attitude towards me, however, had changed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He did not receive me with open arms as he had done before.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But being a rather easygoing sort of fellow, I did not notice this until I had been home for four or five days.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Some incident or other brought it to my notice; and when I looked about me, I saw that not only had my uncle become strange, but my aunt and my cousin also.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Even my uncle’s eldest son, who had not long before written to me for advice, saying that he was intending to go to a commercial college in Tokyo after his graduation from high school, seemed to behave strangely.It was in my nature to begin wondering.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Why is it that my feelings have changed?” I asked myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But quickly the question became: “Why is it that their feelings have changed?” And suddenly, I began to think that my dead father and mother had lifted the veil from my eyes so that I could see the world clearly for what it really was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You see, somewhere in my heart I believed that my parents, though they had departed from this world, still loved me as they had done when alive.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I do not think that even at that time, the rational part of me was undeveloped.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But there was deeply rooted in my system a core of superstition bequeathed to me by my ancestors.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I think that it is there still.I went alone to the hill where my parents were buried and knelt down before their grave.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I knelt partly in sorrow, and partly in gratitude.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And as though my future happiness were held in the hands of these two buried under the cold stone, I prayed to them to watch over my destiny.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You may laugh; and I will not blame you if you do.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I was that sort of person.All of a sudden, my world had changed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had had this experience before.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was, I think, in my sixteenth or seventeenth year that with a shock, I discovered that there was beauty in this world.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I rubbed my eyes many times, not believing what they saw.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And then my heart cried out: “How beautiful!” It is at the age of sixteen or seventeen that both boys and girls become—to use a popular expression—“love-conscious.” I was no different from the others, and for the first time in my life I was able to see women as the personification of beauty in this world.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My eyes, which had been blind to the existence of the opposite sex, were suddenly opened; and before them a whole new universe unravelled itself.My awareness—my sudden awareness—of my uncle’s attitude was, I suppose, a similar experience.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It rushed at me without warning.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My uncle and his family appeared before my eyes as totally different beings.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was shocked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I began to feel that unless I did something, I might be lost.I thought that I owed it to my dead parents to find out from my uncle the details of the family fortune which I had left to his management.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It seemed that he was as busy as he professed to be, for he never slept under the same roof for more than a few nights at a time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For every two days in our house, he would spend three in town.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whenever I saw him, I found him in a fidgety mood.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I am so busy, so busy .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".” he would automatically say, and then hurry away.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before I began to doubt him, I was inclined to believe that he was really busy, or, when in a cynical mood, I would tell myself that it was probably the latest fashion to appear busy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But after I had decided to have a long talk with him about my inheritance, I began to suspect that he was trying to avoid such a talk.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, I did not find it easy to get hold of him.Then I heard that my uncle was keeping a mistress in town.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The rumor reached me through an old friend of mine, who had been a classmate at high school.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Considering my uncle’s character, his having a mistress was nothing to be surprised about, but I, who had never heard such rumors about him during my father’s lifetime, was shocked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My friend told me of other things that were being said about my uncle: one of them was that though at one time his business enterprises were thought to be failing, his situation seemed to have improved considerably in the last two or three years.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was given another reason for suspecting my uncle.At last, I had a conference with him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To say that “I had a conference” may sound odd, but that is about the only way I can describe our talk.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My uncle persisted in treating me like a child, while I regarded him with suspicion from the beginning.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was certainly no chance of our talk ending amicably.Unfortunately, I am in too much of a hurry to describe the results of the “conference” in detail.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To tell the truth, there is something much more important that I want to write about.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am hardly able to restrain my pen, which seems anxious to reach the main part of the narrative.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Having lost forever the opportunity of talking to you at my leisure, I cannot say all the things that I wish to say.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am a slow and inexperienced writer, and I have little time.You remember of course that day when I said that there was no such thing in this world as a species of men whose unique quality is badness; and that one should always be careful not to forget that a gentleman, when tempted, may easily become a rogue.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You were then good enough to point out to me that I was excited.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You also asked what it was that caused good men to become bad; and when I answered simply, “Money,” you looked dissatisfied.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I remember well that look of dissatisfaction on your face.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I now confess to you that I was then thinking of my uncle.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"With hatred in my heart, I was thinking of my uncle, who seemed to typify all those ordinary men who become evil for the sake of money, and who seemed to me the personification of all those things in this world which make it unworthy of trust.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To you who wished to probe deeply into the realm of ideas, my answer must have been quite unsatisfactory: it must have seemed trite.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But for me, the answer that I gave was a living truth.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Was I not excited?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I believe that words uttered in passion contain a greater living truth than do those words which express thoughts rationally conceived.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It is blood that moves the body.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Words are not meant to stir the air only: they are capable of moving greater things.In short, my uncle cheated me of my inheritance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He managed to do so without much difficulty during the three years that I was away in Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was incredibly naïve to have trustingly left everything under my uncle’s management.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It depends of course on the point of view: some, who do not consider worldliness a great virtue, may admire such a display of innocence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, I can never think of those days without cursing myself for being so trusting and honest.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I find myself asking, “Why was I born so good-natured?” But, I must admit, I sometimes wish that I had never lost my old innocence, and that once more I could be the person that I was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Please remember that you met me after I had become soiled.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If one respects one’s elders because they have lived longer and have become more soiled than oneself, then certainly I deserve your respect.There is little doubt that if I had married my cousin as my uncle wished, I would have profited materially.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His real reasons for wanting me to marry his daughter were of course selfish.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was not simply the interest of the two houses that he had at heart: our marriage was to further his own base designs.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did not love my cousin, but I did not dislike her either.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I find that now I take a certain amount of pleasure in the fact that I refused to make her my wife.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It is true that I would have been cheated even if I had married her, but I have at least the consolation that in one matter at least, I had my way.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This is, however, an unimportant detail.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To you, it must seem that I am being rather silly and petty.Other relatives of mine stepped in to settle the quarrel between me and my uncle.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had no trust in any of them.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In fact, I regarded them as my enemies.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I took it for granted that since my uncle had cheated me, they also would do the same.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“If my uncle,” I said to myself, “whom my father praised so much, could cheat me, then what reason have I to trust them?”It was through their mediation, however, that I managed to receive all that remained to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It amounted to far less than I had expected.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There were two courses open to me: one was to accept quietly what was offered to me; and the other was to sue him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was angry, but I hesitated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I feared that if I took the latter course, I would have to wait a long time before the court reached a decision.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was a student, and time was very precious to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not want my studies interrupted.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I went to an old high school friend of mine who lived in town, and asked him to help me convert all my assets into cash.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He advised me against doing so, but I would not listen.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had decided to leave, and stay away from home for a long time to come.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had made a vow never to see my uncle’s face again.Before leaving, I paid another visit to my parents’ grave.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I have not seen it since.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I don’t suppose I shall ever see it again.My friend settled my affairs for me as I had asked, though he was not able to do so before a long time had passed after my return to Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It is not an easy thing to sell one’s lands in the country.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, prospective buyers are always quick to take advantage of one’s difficulties.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The amount I finally received was much less than what my lands were worth.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To tell the truth, my entire capital consisted of a few bonds that I had brought with me when I left home, and the money that I subsequently received through my friend.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No doubt, my original inheritance was worth far more.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What I found particularly galling was the fact that I myself had not been responsible for the dwindling of the family fortune.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What I had, however, was certainly more than adequate for a student.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As a matter of fact, I could not spend more than half the interest that accrued from my capital.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Had I been in less easy circumstances as a student, I might not have been forced into such undreamt-of situations as later came my way.As there was no more need for me to live as economically as I had done before, I began to toy with the idea of leaving the noisy boarding house and settling in a house of my own.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was, however, somewhat hesitant at first to put the idea into practice.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did not relish the thought of having to buy the necessary household goods, and of having to find an old housekeeper who was honest and whom I could depend upon to look after the house properly while I was away.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, I decided one day to go for a walk and at the same time see if there were any vacant houses that I might find particularly attractive.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I walked down the west side of Hongodai Hill and then up the slope of Koishikawa towards Denzuin Temple.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The whole area has changed in appearance since the trams started going through there, but in those days, there was merely the mud wall of the Arsenal on the left as one walked up the slope, and on the right, there were only open fields.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I stopped for a moment, and thinking of nothing in particular, looked towards the hill on the other side of the valley.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The view is not bad even now, but it was much more pleasant then.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
All was green as far as I could see: it was a soothing sight.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I then began to wonder whether a suitable house could not be found in the neighborhood.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I walked across the fields until I came to a narrow lane, and then followed it northward.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Even today, that neighborhood has a higgledy-piggledy look.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You can imagine what it was like in those days.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I walked around in circles through innumerable little alleys until I came upon a small confectioner’s.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I went in and asked the woman who kept the shop whether she knew of a small but neat house that I could rent.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Well, let me see now .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".” she said, and for a while appeared to be in deep thought.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She then said, “I am afraid I can’t think of one at the moment.” I decided there was no hope, and was about to leave the shop when she said: “Would you mind living with a family?” I became interested.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After all, I thought to myself, living as the only paying guest in a quiet household would probably be more convenient than having a house of one’s own.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I sat down, and the woman began to tell me about a family she knew of that might take me in.It was an army family; or, to be more accurate, a family that had once been connected with the army.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The head of it had been killed, the woman believed, in the Sino-Japanese War.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The bereaved family had lived in their old house near the Officers’ School at Ichigaya until the previous year, but had found it too large—it was the sort of house with stables attached to it—and so had sold it and moved into a smaller one.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There were only three people living in the house, the woman told me: the widow, her daughter, and one maid.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The widow had apparently said to the woman that it was rather lonely in the new house, and that she would like a boarder, if someone suitable could be found.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I thought that the house would be very quiet and that it would suit me very well.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I was afraid that such a family would not wish to take in a student about whom they knew nothing.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was tempted to give up the idea of going to the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I reminded myself, however, that for a student I looked quite respectable.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, I was wearing my university cap.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, you will laugh, and say, “What is so impressive about a university cap?” But in those days, university students were regarded with more respect than they are now.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My square cap, then, gave me the confidence I needed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Following the directions given me by the woman in the confectioner’s, and without proper introduction of any kind, I made my way to the house.I introduced myself to the widow, and told her the purpose of my visit.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She questioned me closely concerning my background, my university, my field of study, and so on.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My answers must have satisfied her, for she did not hesitate to say that I could move in as soon as I wished.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The lady had an honest and direct manner.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was quite impressed, and thought to myself: “Are all soldiers’ wives like her?” At the same time, I was surprised that a lady of such obvious strength of character could ever feel lonely.I moved immediately.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was given the room in which our interview had taken place.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was the finest room in the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had by no means been living in squalor before: by my time, there were already a few high-class boarding houses in existence in the Hongo area.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had become accustomed to living in rooms which, by student standards, were more than adequate.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But my new room was far more impressive than any I had had before in Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I first moved into it, I felt that it was perhaps a little too grand for a student.It was an eight-mat room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was an alcove, and beside it, some ornamental shelves.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the side opposite the verandah, there was a closet six feet wide.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There were no windows, but the room opened onto a sunny verandah, facing the south.As soon as I moved into the room, I noticed a vase of flowers in the alcove.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A koto2 stood against the wall of the alcove, next to the flowers.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Neither the flowers nor the koto pleased me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Having been brought up by a father who was fond of such things as Chinese poetry, calligraphy, and the tea ceremony, I was from childhood inclined to severity in my taste.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had learned to be contemptuous of such obvious attempts at charm as I found in the alcove.Thanks to my uncle, the greater part of my father’s art collection had disappeared, but there still remained to me a few items of value, most of which I had left with my friend at home for safekeeping.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There were, however, four or five hanging scrolls that had struck my fancy, and these I took out of their wooden cases and put at the bottom of my trunk before leaving for Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had been looking forward to hanging one of them in the alcove of my new room, but when I saw the flowers and the koto, I lost heart.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I learned later that the flowers had been put there to please me, I was secretly amused and exasperated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The koto apparently had always been there, and I suppose they could not find another place for it.I think it likely that the shadow of a young woman has already begun to pass before your mind’s eye.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I must admit that I began to be curious about the young lady even before I moved in.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Perhaps this vulgar curiosity on my part made me self-conscious, or perhaps I had not yet overcome my youthful shyness; but whatever the reason may have been, I behaved very awkwardly when I was introduced to Ojosan.3 She, on her part, blushed.I had already formed a picture in my mind of what she would be like from my observation of her mother’s appearance and manner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The picture was not altogether flattering.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Deciding that her mother was the soldier’s wife par excellence, I had gone on to imagine what a typical soldier’s daughter would be like.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But all my preconceptions about Ojosan vanished as soon as I saw her face.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I was filled with a new awareness, far greater than any that I had ever experienced before, of the power of the opposite sex.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After that, the flowers in the alcove ceased to displease me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The presence of the koto did not annoy me any more.Whenever the flowers in the vase showed signs of wilting, she would come in to replace them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, she came in to take the koto away to her room, which was diagonally opposite mine.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I would then sit quietly at my desk, my chin resting on my hands, and listen to the sound of the koto.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not be sure whether her playing was good or bad.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But as she never played a piece that sounded complicated, I was inclined to suspect that she was not quite an expert.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In fact, I thought it likely that her koto-playing was no better than her flower arrangement.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I know something about the latter art, and I can safely say that Ojosan was by no means a master of it.Unblushingly, however, she persisted in decorating my alcove with flowers of all kinds.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
They were arranged always in the same way and always in the same vase.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Stranger still was the music.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"All that one heard was a series of hesitant, disconnected plucking sounds, and one could hardly hear the singing that these sounds were meant to accompany.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I do not say that she did not sing.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But her singing was rather timid, and had what one might call a confidential tone.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When scolded, she became even less audible.Happily, however, I gazed at the badly arranged flowers and listened to the strange music.I was already a misanthrope when I left home for the last time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That people could not be trusted must already have become a conviction deeply rooted in my system.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was then that I began to think of my uncle, my aunt, and all the other relatives whom I had come to hate as typical of the entire human race.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the Tokyo-bound train, I found myself watching suspiciously my fellow passengers.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And when any spoke to me, I became even more suspicious.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My heart was heavy.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt as though I had swallowed lead.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But my nerves were on edge.I am quite sure that my state of mind was largely responsible for my wanting to leave the boarding house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It would of course be simpler to attribute my desire to have a house of my own to my sudden affluence; but I am convinced that I would not have gone to the trouble of moving if the change had been merely economic.For quite a while after I had moved to Koishikawa, I could not relax.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I looked at everything around me with such obvious shiftiness that I became ashamed of myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Strangely enough, I became less and less inclined to talk, while my mind and eyes increased their activity enormously.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I sat silently at my desk, and like a cat, watched the movements of others in the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was so much on my guard that sometimes I had the grace enough to feel guilty towards them.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I am behaving like a pickpocket who doesn’t steal,” I would tell myself disgustedly.You are probably asking yourself: “If he was indeed in such a state, how is it that he was able to feel affection for Ojosan?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"How could he have enjoyed her bad flower arrangement and her koto-playing?” I can only answer that I truly did experience these conflicting emotions at the time, and that I can do no more than describe them to you as faithfully as I can.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am sure that you are quite capable of finding a satisfactory explanation yourself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But let me say this: I had come to distrust people in money matters, but I had not yet learned to doubt love.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And so, strange as it may seem to another person and inconsistent as it may seem even to me when I think about it, I was quite unaware of any conflict between the two states of mind.It was my custom to call the widow “Okusan,”4 so I shall refer to her as such from now on.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan was wont to comment on my calm disposition—as she would call it—and my quietness, and on one occasion praised me for being so studious.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She said nothing about insecurity or shiftiness.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I don’t know whether she failed to notice my odd behavior or whether she was too polite to mention it, but she certainly seemed inclined to view me in a favorable light.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She once went so far as to say to me in an admiring tone that I had a generous heart.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was honest enough to blush and to say that she was mistaken.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She said quite seriously, “You say that because you are unaware of your own virtues.” It seems that she had not expected to have a student in her house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When she let it be known in the neighborhood that she was willing to take in a boarder, she was apparently hoping for some kind of civil servant to apply.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I suspect that she was quite resigned to the fact that only an underpaid petty official would want a room in someone else’s house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When she called me a generous-hearted person, she must have been comparing me with this shabby civil servant of her imagination.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, I had some money, and, I suppose, lived in a way which is impossible for those who are financially embarrassed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In money matters, then, I could afford to be liberal.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But this kind of liberality has nothing to do with one’s nature.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It seems that Okusan, in the way that women have, was apt to assume that my attitude towards money was an indication of the generosity of my heart.Okusan’s manner towards me gradually changed my own state of mind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I became less shifty, and began to feel more relaxed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I suppose the fact that Okusan and the rest of the household took no notice of my suspicious and withdrawn manner gave me great comfort.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Since there was nothing in my surroundings that seemed to justify watchfulness, I began to calm down.Okusan was a woman of some understanding, and it is possible that she behaved as she did because she knew my mood.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It is also possible that she really did think me a peaceful, generous, and easygoing person.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The latter is more likely, for I do not suppose that my outward behavior betrayed the confusion within very often.Gradually, as I grew more calm, I came to know the family better.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I began to exchange witticisms with Okusan and Ojosan.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There were days when I was invited to drink tea with them.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There were evenings when I would go out and buy sweets and then invite them to my room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I felt that suddenly, my circle of acquaintances had been considerably enlarged.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, many hours were wasted in conversation which should have been spent in study.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I was surprised to find that I did not mind this at all.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan, of course, had little to do all day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But to my surprise, Ojosan, who not only attended school but was studying flower arrangement and the koto as well, never seemed busy either.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And so the three of us were willing enough, whenever the opportunity presented itself, to get together and entertain one another with small talk.It was usually Ojosan that came to call me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She would sometimes appear on the verandah, and sometimes, she would come through the morning room and appear at my door.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She would stand still for a moment, and then call my name and say, “Are you studying?” I was usually staring hard at some heavy tome lying open on my desk, and so I must have seemed a rather scholarly fellow.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But to tell the truth, I was not much of a student in those days.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I might have looked at a lot of books, but I was usually waiting for Ojosan to appear.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If by chance she failed to do so, then I would get up and go to her room, and say, “Are you studying?”Ojosan’s was a six-mat room next to the morning room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan would sometimes be sitting in the morning room and sometimes in her daughter’s room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The two rooms were really used like one large room by the two ladies, neither of whom seemed to regard either room as exclusively hers.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whenever I called to them from outside the door, it was invariably Okusan who said, “Come in.” Ojosan, even when she was there, hardly ever joined her mother in the invitation.Occasionally, when Ojosan came to my room on some errand, she would sit down for a chat.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At such times, I felt strangely uneasy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Afterwards, I would try, with little success, to convince myself that my uneasiness was no more than the natural embarrassment of a young man finding himself alone with a young woman.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was not so much embarrassment as a feeling of restlessness; and the cause of this restlessness was the unnatural feeling that I was somehow being a traitor to my true self.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She, on her part, seemed perfectly at ease.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She was, in fact, so self-possessed that I would ask myself, “Is this the same girl that is so self-conscious of her voice during her koto lessons?” Sometimes, when she stayed too long, her mother would call her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remember that on more than one occasion she merely answered, “I’m coming,” and remained where she was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Ojosan was by no means a child, however.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
This was quite clear to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What was also clear to me was that she wanted me to know she was no longer a child.After her departure I would sigh with relief.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At the same time, the room would seem empty, and I would apologize to her inwardly for the relief I had felt.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Perhaps I was behaving like a woman.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It must certainly seem so to a modern young man like yourself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But most of us were like that in those days.Okusan hardly ever went out of the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whenever she did so, she was sure to take Ojosan with her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not tell whether she did this for a particular reason or not.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Perhaps it is not quite proper for me to say this, but it did seem to me, after I had carefully watched Okusan for a while, that she was encouraging me and her daughter to become better acquainted with each other.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, there were times when she appeared to be on her guard against me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The first time she gave me this impression, I was a little annoyed.You see, I wanted to know precisely what her attitude was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From my point of view at least, her conduct was quite illogical.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And having only recently been cheated by my uncle, I could not stop myself from suspecting Okusan of duplicity, and from assuming that one of her two attitudes was a deliberate deception.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not understand the reason for her seemingly inconsistent behavior.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Why should she behave so strangely?” I would ask myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And finding no answer to the question, I would angrily mutter to myself, “Women!” Then I would try to find comfort in the thought that Okusan behaved as she did because she was a woman, and women, after all, were idiots.In spite of my contempt for women, however, I found it impossible to be contemptuous of Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It seemed that reason was powerless in her presence.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My love for her was close to piety.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You may think it strange that I should use this word, with its religious connotation, to describe my feeling towards a woman.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But even now I believe—and I believe it very strongly—that true love is not so far removed from religious faith.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whenever I saw Ojosan’s face, I felt that I had myself become beautiful.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whenever I thought of her, I felt a new sense of dignity welling up inside me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If this incomprehensible thing that we call love can either bring out the sacred in man or, in its lowest form, merely excite one’s bodily passions, then surely my love was of the highest kind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am not saying that I was not like other men.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am made of flesh too.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But my eyes which gazed at her, and my mind which held thoughts of her, were innocent of bodily desire.As you can well imagine, relations between the three of us became rather complicated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was growing more and more fond of the daughter while my antagonism towards the mother increased.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Our feelings, however, were hardly ever allowed to appear on the surface, and the change of atmosphere in the house was not openly recognized.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And then suddenly, for some reason or other, I began to wonder if I had not been mistaken about Okusan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I began to think that perhaps her apparent inconsistency was not a sign of dishonesty, and that contrary to my previous suspicion, perhaps neither of her two attitudes was a conscious attempt to deceive me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I came to acknowledge the possibility that the two seemingly conflicting attitudes existed side by side, and that the existence of one need not necessarily preclude the other.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I decided finally that even when she seemed suddenly to become watchful after having encouraged her daughter to be friendly with me, she was not truly changing her mind: she was merely preventing us from becoming closer to each other than her sense of propriety allowed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I, who had no dishonorable intentions, did feel that Okusan was worrying unnecessarily, but I ceased to bear her a grudge.Shortly thereafter, when I had observed Okusan’s behavior towards me in a different light, I came to the conclusion that she put considerable trust in me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, I was given reason to believe that she had begun to trust me from the time of our first meeting.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This discovery was a great shock to me, who had learned to be distrustful of everybody.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Are women endowed with intuitive powers so great,” I asked myself, “that they know at a glance whom to trust and whom not to trust?” But later, I said to myself: “Is it not because women are so trusting that they are constantly being deceived by men?” It is amusing to think that it never occurred to me then to examine my own confidence in Ojosan, which was based on nothing more than intuition.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Though I had vowed never to trust people, I trusted Ojosan absolutely.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Yet I found Okusan’s trust in me quite incredible.I told them very little about my home.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Concerning the incident that caused me to leave, I said nothing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was unpleasant for me to think about it, let alone talk about it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I tried always, therefore, to steer the conversation to Okusan’s past life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But she would not co-operate.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She insisted many times on hearing about my home.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally, I told them everything.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I said that I would never go home again since there was nothing left for me there except my parents’ grave, Okusan seemed very moved.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Ojosan cried.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt that I had done the right thing in telling them my story.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was glad.After our conversation, Okusan began to act as though her intuitions about me had been confirmed and to treat me as she would a young relation of hers.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
This did not annoy me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was even pleased.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before long, however, I began once more to suspect her motives.It was only something very petty that put me in a suspicious frame of mind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But this did not prevent me from becoming more and more suspicious as time went by.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Some small incident—I forget what—put the idea into my head that Okusan was forcing her daughter onto me from the same motives as those which prompted my uncle when he wished me to marry his daughter.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan, whom I had taken for a kindly person, quickly became a cunning schemer in my eyes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was filled with disgust.When Okusan first told me that loneliness was the reason why she had wanted a boarder, I believed her; and after I had come to know her well, I found no cause to change my mind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, she was by no means a wealthy woman, and from the financial point of view, I was certainly not unattractive as a prospective son-in-law.Once more, I found myself on the defensive.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, I stood to gain nothing from such an attitude, since I remained very much in love with Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I laughed at myself in scorn.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I told myself that I was an idiot.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If my suspicions had gone no further, I should not have suffered very much, and I should simply have laughed at myself for being such an inconsistent fool.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I began to be really miserable when the thought occurred to me that perhaps Ojosan was no less of a schemer than her mother.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was unbearably painful to imagine the two of them plotting behind my back.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was not merely unhappy: I was desperate.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But there was another part of me that trusted Ojosan absolutely.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I stood still, unable to move away from the half-way point between conviction and doubt.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To me, both seemed like figments of my imagination, and yet both seemed real.I continued to attend lectures at the university.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But the professors who stood on the platforms seemed very far away, and their voices faint.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not study either.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The printed characters that my eyes saw disappeared like rising smoke before they reached my mind.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Also, I became silent.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Two or three of my friends misconstrued my silence, and reported to the others that I seemed to be deep in some kind of philosophic meditation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not try to undeceive them.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, I was happy to hide behind the mask that they had unwittingly put on me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I cannot have been entirely satisfied with the role, however.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I would sometimes throw fits of riotous merrymaking that would shock them considerably.There were not many visitors to the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan seemed to have a few relatives.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Ojosan’s school friends visited her occasionally, but they were so quiet that one could hardly tell that they were in the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
They were being quiet for my sake; but I did not know this.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My own friends who came to the house were none of them rowdy fellows, but they were not so demure as to start whispering for the sake of other people’s comfort.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At such times, I seemed to enjoy all the rights due to the owner of the house, while Ojosan’s position was hardly better than that of an unwanted guest.This is not of great importance, however.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wrote it down simply because it came to my mind: besides, it leads me to something less insignificant.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One day, I heard a man’s voice coming from Ojosan’s room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Being Ojosan’s guest, he spoke far more quietly than any of my friends would have done.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I found it impossible, therefore, to hear what he was saying.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I remained seated at my desk in helpless indignation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Was he a relative, I asked myself, or was he merely an acquaintance?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Was he young, or was he old?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was of course impossible to find answers to these questions in my room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I could hardly barge into Ojosan’s room to inspect the visitor.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was more than irritated: I was truly in agony.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As soon as the man went away, I left my room to ask who he was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
They gave me a simple answer.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was too simple to satisfy me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I looked at them discontentedly, lacking the courage to question them further.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had no right, of course, to be so curious.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had to maintain my dignity and my self-respect which I had been taught to value.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But the fact that this self-respect was not succeeding too well in overcoming my vulgar curiosity showed in my discontented face.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
They laughed.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whether they did so in derision, or out of friendliness, I was too flustered at that moment to find out.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Afterwards, I repeatedly asked myself: “Did they make a fool of me, or didn’t they?”I was free to do anything I liked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Without consulting anyone, I could leave the university at any time, I could go anywhere, live in any way that suited me, and get married if I wished.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Often, I was on the verge of asking Okusan for permission to marry her daughter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But each time I decided to do so, I quickly changed my mind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The prospect of being refused did not frighten me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, life would be different without Ojosan, but I thought that there would at least be the compensation of being able to look at a new world from another vantage point.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, I thought that I had the necessary courage to accept such a change.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I hated the idea of being enticed by Okusan to swallow her bait.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No matter what happened, I vowed to myself, no one would ever dupe me as my uncle had done.Seeing me buy nothing but books, Okusan said that I should buy myself some new clothes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, all the clothes that I possessed had been made at home, of cotton woven locally.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was not the custom for students to wear silk in those days.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I remember that a friend of mine once received a heavy silk garment from home.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His father, incidentally, was a Yokohama merchant whose tastes were rather ostentatious.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When the garment arrived, we all laughed at the fellow.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was quite embarrassed, and made all sorts of excuses.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He tossed it into his trunk, and would not put it on.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We finally bullied him into wearing it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Unfortunately, it caught fleas from somewhere.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My friend must have been pleased, for he wasted no time in getting rid of the famous garment.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He rolled it up into a bundle, and taking it with him on one of his walks, threw it into the large ditch in Nezu.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was with him at the time.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I remember standing on the bridge and watching my friend with amusement.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It never occurred to me then to think that he was being wasteful.All this happened when I was still living in a boarding house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had matured somewhat since then, but I was not yet so clothes-conscious as to start worrying about being well-dressed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I still had the odd notion that good clothes, like a mustache, came after graduation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This is why I remarked to Okusan that though books were necessary, clothes were not.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She knew that I bought a great number of books, and she asked me: “Tell me, do you read them all?” Amongst them were, of course, such necessary books of reference as dictionaries, but there were also many that I had not yet even opened.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was at a loss for an answer.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I thought that as long as I was going to buy unnecessary things, I might just as well spend money on clothes as on books.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, I had been wanting to buy Ojosan a present, such as a sash or a length of material, under the pretext of showing my appreciation for their many kindnesses.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I asked Okusan, therefore, if she would be good enough to buy something suitable for her daughter, and for myself.Okusan refused to go by herself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She commanded me to accompany her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She insisted also that her daughter come too.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Brought up as we were in an atmosphere quite different from that of today, we students were not accustomed to being seen in the streets in the company of young women.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then, I was even more of a slave to convention than I am now.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I hesitated at first, but I finally overcame my scruples and set out with the two ladies.Ojosan had taken great care over her appearance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Though she was naturally very light-complexioned, she had covered her face liberally with white powder, which made her conspicuous.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Passers-by stared at her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What gave me a strange feeling was the fact that after they had had a good look at her, they would begin to stare at me.The three of us went to a shop in Nihonbashi and bought what we wanted.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was difficult to decide what to buy, and we spent more time there than I had expected.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan insisted on my giving an opinion on everything that was shown to us.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She would drape a piece of cloth on Ojosan’s shoulder, then ask me to step back a few paces, and say: “Well, how do you like it?” I tried to play my part properly, and never failed to give some kind of opinion.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I don’t think that looks very good,” I would say; or “Yes, that would suit her very well.”When we finally left the shop, it was time for dinner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan said that to thank me for being so kind, she would like to take me out to dinner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She led us into a narrow side street called Kiharadana where there was, I noticed, a small old-fashioned theater.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The restaurant we went into was as poky as the street.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was not at all familiar with the neighborhood, and I was amazed that Okusan should know it so well.It was quite late in the evening when we returned home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The next day was Sunday, and I spent it in my room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As soon as I appeared at the university on Monday morning, a classmate of mine came up to me and began to tease me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“When did you get married?” he said in mock seriousness.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Your wife is quite a beauty, I must say!” He must have seen the three of us in Nihonbashi.When I got home, I told Okusan and Ojosan what my friend had said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan laughed.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She then gave me an odd look, and said: “It must have been rather annoying for you.” I immediately thought that this was probably a woman’s way of sounding out a man’s inner thoughts.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Perhaps I should then have told her frankly how I felt towards her daughter.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I was too suspicious to be honest.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I restrained my impulse to tell her the truth, and deliberately steered the conversation away from myself to the subject of Ojosan’s marriage.I tried to find out what Okusan’s plans were for her daughter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She clearly implied that Ojosan had already received some offers of marriage.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She explained that since her daughter was still at school, she felt that there was no need to hurry.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Though she did not say so outright, it was obvious that she set great store by her daughter’s good looks, and hinted that she could marry her off any time she wished.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Ojosan was her only child, and of course she was reluctant to part from her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I suspected that she was in a quandary as to whether she ought to allow her daughter to marry into another family, or whether she should arrange to adopt a son-in-law who would become a member of her own household.As the conversation progressed, I felt that I was learning much that was of interest to me from Okusan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I had lost the opportunity of talking about myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Thinking that I could not, at this late stage in the conversation, put in a word on my own behalf, I decided to leave as soon as I could do so without seeming rude.Ojosan was sitting near me when I told them what my friend had said that morning: she even said merrily, “That’s going too far!”; but she had quietly withdrawn to the corner of the room in the course of the conversation, and was now sitting with her back turned towards me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was not aware that she had moved until I was about to get up and go.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I saw her back when I turned around to look at her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was of course impossible to read her thoughts without seeing her face.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not even begin to guess how she felt about marriage.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She sat near the closet.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The door was open, and I decided that she had taken something out of it, placed it on her lap, and was looking at it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Through the open door of the closet, I caught a glimpse of the pieces of cloth that I had bought two days before.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The cloth that I had bought for her, and the cloth that I had bought for myself, were lying one on top of the other.I said no more, and I was about to stand up when Okusan suddenly said to me in a serious tone, “What do you think?” Her question was so sudden that for a moment, I wondered what she was talking about.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then I realized that she was asking me whether or not her daughter should get married soon.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Oh, I think that she should wait a while, don’t you?” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan said that she thought so too.The relationship between the three of us had developed thus far when another man appeared on the scene.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He became a member of the household, and by doing so, changed the course of my destiny.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If this man had never crossed my path, I don’t suppose there would ever have arisen the necessity for me to write this long letter to you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The devil had passed before me, so to speak, casting his shadow over me for a moment.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I did not know that his passing had darkened my life for ever.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I must tell you that it was I who dragged this man into the house to live with us.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Needless to say, I had first to get Okusan’s permission to do so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I told her everything about the man, and asked her if he might come and stay with me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
At first she said no.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But while I felt myself absolutely obliged to invite him, she seemed to have no reasonable basis for her objection.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally, I had my way.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was able to do what I thought was right.I shall here call my friend “K.” K and I were friends from the time we were children.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Needless to say, then, we were from the same part of the country.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K was the son of a priest of the Shinshu sect.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was the second son, and was sent as an adopted son to the house of a certain doctor.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The Hongan church was very powerful in my native district, and so Shinshu priests were more affluent than the priests of other sects.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For example, if a Shinshu priest happened to have a daughter of marrying age, he would have little trouble marrying her into a suitable family through the kind offices of a parishioner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, wedding expenses would not come out of the priest’s pocket.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For reasons such as this, Shinshu priests were generally quite prosperous.K’s family lived comfortably.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But whether they possessed enough means to send their younger son to Tokyo to complete his studies, I do not know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Nor do I know that arrangements for his adoption were made in order that his chances of further education might be improved.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whatever the reason, then, K went as an adopted son to the house of the doctor.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
This happened when we were still in the secondary school.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remember even now my surprise when, during roll call in class one day, I found that my friend’s name had suddenly been changed.K’s new family was a wealthy one, and his education was to be financed by them; so he came to Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Though K and I did not travel up together, we moved into the same boarding house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In those days, it was common practice for two or three students to live and sleep in one room, and work at desks placed next to each other, as did K and myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We were like wild beasts captured in the mountains, that hug each other and stare angrily from their cage at the world outside.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We feared Tokyo and the people in it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Nevertheless, when we were in our little six-mat room, we would talk contemptuously of the whole world.But we were in earnest, and seriously intended to become great men one day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, K was very earnest.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Having been born in a temple, he often spoke of “concentration of mind.” And to me, it seemed that this phrase described completely his daily life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My heart was filled with reverence for K.From the time we were at school, K was in the habit of embarrassing me by bringing up such difficult matters as religion and philosophy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I do not know whether this was the result of his father’s influence, or the result of having been born in a house possessing an atmosphere peculiar to temples.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, it seems to me that he had more of the priest in him than the average priest.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K’s foster parents had originally sent him to Tokyo with the intention of making him a doctor.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But K, who was very stubborn, had come to Tokyo resolved never to become a doctor.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I reproached him, pointing out that he was deceiving his foster parents.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Undaunted, he agreed with me, and then answered that he did not mind doing such a thing, so long as it led him to “the true way.” In all likelihood, even he did not know what he meant by “the true way.” I certainly did not know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But to us who were young, these vague words seemed quite sacred.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Ignorant though I was, I was certain that there was no meanness in his enthusiastic decision to follow the dictates of what seemed to me to be noble sentiments.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I fully agreed, therefore, with K’s views.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To what extent K was encouraged by my agreement, I do not know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Undoubtedly, K, single-minded as he was, would not have altered his opinion, no matter how much I might have disagreed with him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And though only a child, I was, I think, more or less aware of my future responsibility through having encouraged K, should anything happen to him as a result of his decision.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My enthusiastic approval implied that in the future, if such an occasion should arise when we would cast our more mature eyes back on what he had done, I would be fully prepared to bear my proper share of responsibility, even though at this moment I might not have felt fully prepared for such a necessity.K and I entered the same faculty.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Without any show of bad conscience, he began to follow his beloved “true way” with the money that his foster parents sent him, and I can only say that he was less troubled than I by his deception; he seemed quite certain that he would never be caught, and he seemed assured enough that even if he were caught, he would not mind at all.When the time came for our first summer vacation, K did not go home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He said that he was going to rent a room in some temple in Komagome.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And true enough, when I returned to Tokyo in early September, I found him holed up in a dirty temple by the Great Kannon.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His room was a small one very close to the main temple building; he was very happy that there he had been able to study to his heart’s content.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was then, I think, that I saw that his life was becoming more and more like that of a priest.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was wearing a rosary around his wrist, and when I asked him what it was for, he showed me how he counted the beads with his thumb, saying one, two, and so on.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Apparently, he counted them many times a day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But the meaning behind all this counting I did not understand.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Surely, I thought, there is no end to counting beads strung together in a circle.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
With what thoughts in his mind did K count those beads?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
This worthless question often comes to my mind now.I also noticed a Bible in his room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was a little surprised.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Though I could recall that on occasion he had spoken of the sutras, I could not remember his ever having mentioned Christianity.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not therefore resist asking him why the Bible was there.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K said that the Bible was there for no particular reason, except that he thought it only natural that one should read a book so highly valued by others.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He added that he intended to read the Koran when he had the opportunity.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He seemed particularly interested in the phrase “Mohammed and the sword.”Finally, after being urged to do so by his people, he went home for the following summer vacation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It seems that when at home, he said nothing about his field of study.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His family seemed not at all suspicious.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You, being a well-educated person, are obviously well-informed about such matters, but the world in general is surprisingly ignorant about student life, academic rules, and so on.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"These things, which are common knowledge to us, are not known at all in the outside world.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Also, we who live in a comparatively isolated atmosphere, are not entirely blameless, in that we tend to assume that academic matters, whether important or not, are well-known throughout all walks of life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In this particular matter, however, it seems that K was more worldly than I.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Looking quite unperturbed, he left home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We were travelling to Tokyo together, and as soon as we boarded the train, I asked K how things stood between him and his family.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He answered that all was well.At the beginning of the third summer vacation—it was at the end of this that I decided to leave forever the birthplace of my parents—I urged K to go home; but he would not listen.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, he asked me why it was that I went home every year.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Evidently he wished to remain in Tokyo, and study.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"With reluctance I left him in Tokyo, and went home alone.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Concerning the two months that I spent at home, which so affected my future life, I shall not write again, since I have already done so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"With my heart filled with dissatisfaction, melancholy, and loneliness, I saw K again in September.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I found that circumstances had changed for the worse for him too.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Without my knowing, he had written to his foster parents, confessing that he had been deceiving them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Apparently, he had from the start intended to write such a confession eventually.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Perhaps he hoped they would say that it was too late to change his plans, and permit him, no matter how grudgingly, to pursue his studies as he wished.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, it seems K had no desire to deceive his foster parents once he was ready to enter the university.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He may have perceived that he could not possibly go on with the deception indefinitely, even if he wanted to do so.K’s foster father was furious when he read K’s letter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He sent back a severe reply, in which he said that he could not possibly finance the education of one so unprincipled as to cheat his parents.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K showed the letter to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He also showed me another letter that arrived about the same time as the first.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was from his original family.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was a letter of reprimand as severe in tone as the other.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Perhaps the severity was due to his family’s sense of obligation to those that had adopted K. At any rate, K was told that for anyone to worry about him would be a waste of time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whether he should return to his original family because of the unhappy incident, or whether he should consider some way of compromise and remain with his adopted family, was a problem for the future, but what required his immediate attention was the question of how he was to pay for his education.I asked K whether he had any definite ideas about the matter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K said that he thought he might teach in some night school.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Compared with now, conditions were surprisingly easy in those days, and it was not as difficult as you might think to find some way of supplementing one’s income.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I therefore thought that K would manage well enough.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At the same time, I felt my own responsibility in the matter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When K decided to go against his foster father’s wishes and to follow his own inclinations, it was I that encouraged him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At this stage then, I could not very well stand aside, and idly watch my friend in his predicament.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I immediately offered K material assistance.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K refused without hesitation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was in his character to feel greater pleasure in being able to fend for himself than in receiving assistance from his friend.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His view, in short, was that once having entered the university, it would be a disgrace to him as a grown man not to be able to solve his own problems by himself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not hurt K’s feelings merely to satisfy my own sense of responsibility.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I therefore withdrew, leaving K to do as he saw fit.Shortly after, K found the kind of work he wanted.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You can well imagine how painful it was for K, who valued his time so much, to have to do such work.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And with this new burden on his shoulders, he drove himself harder than ever, so that he might study as he had done before.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I began to worry about his health.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But he was a stouthearted fellow, and took no notice of my anxious warnings.About this time, relations between him and his adopted family grew steadily worse and more complicated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As K had now no time to spare, we had little opportunity to talk as we had done before, and I did not hear all the particulars; but I knew how much more difficult of solution the whole problem had become.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I knew also that one person had tried to act as mediator between the two parties.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
This person had actually tried by letter to persuade K to come home.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But K refused, saying that it was absolutely impossible.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This stubbornness on his part—or so it seemed to the people at home, though K had pointed out to them that he could not leave Tokyo during term-time—made the situation worse; not only did he hurt his foster parents’ feelings, but he angered his original family as well.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In my anxiety, I wrote a conciliatory letter to soothe their feelings, but it seemed to have no effect whatsoever.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My letter, it seems, did not merit even a word in reply.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I also became angry.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Circumstances had so far made me sympathize with K; but now I was determined to stand by K, whether he was right or wrong.In the end K decided to become officially a member of his original family once more.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
They arranged to pay back to K’s late foster parents the money spent on his education so far.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"However, beyond this, his family would do no more.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They had washed their hands of him, they said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was, I suppose, “expelled from his father’s house,” to use an old-fashioned phrase.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, perhaps his family did not intend to be so final in their treatment of K; but K, at least, felt that he had been disinherited.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K was motherless, and it is more than likely that a part of his character was the result of his having been brought up by a stepmother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I cannot but feel that had his real mother been alive, such a wide gulf might not have come to exist between him and his family.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I have already said that K’s father was a priest.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I believe that in his unbending regard for honor, he was perhaps more like a samurai than a priest.The excitement over K had abated somewhat when I received a long letter from his elder sister’s husband.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K told me that this man was related to his foster parents, and had therefore played an important part in the proceedings when he was adopted and when his adoption was revoked.In the letter, the brother-in-law asked me to let him know if all was well with K. He said that K’s sister was worried, and that she would like to have news of him as soon as possible.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K was fonder of his sister than he was of his elder brother, who had succeeded to his father’s rectory.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They were born of the same mother, but there was a considerable difference in age between K and his sister.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To K, she must have seemed more of a mother than his stepmother ever did.I showed the letter to K. He made no comment, except that he himself had received two or three letters similar in content from his sister, and that he had written back saying that there was no need to worry.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Unfortunately, his sister had not married into a well-to-do family.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Though she sympathized with K, she could give him no material assistance.I wrote a reply to the brother-in-law, repeating more or less what K had already said in his letters.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did add, however, a strongly worded assurance that K could always count on my assistance whenever it was necessary.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was, of course, sincere in my assurance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt too that I should try to comfort K’s sister as best I could.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But there is no doubt that in insisting so strongly that I would and could assist K, I was also being indirectly spiteful to his father and to his foster parents, who had, it seemed, treated me with contempt.K’s adoption was revoked in his first year at the university.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For a year and a half after that, he worked hard to support himself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Eventually, I began to think that this continual strain was affecting his physical and mental condition.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, the squabbling that preceded his decision to leave his adoptive family must have left its mark on him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He became more and more sentimental,5 and occasionally, he would talk as though he carried on his own back the misfortune of all mankind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When one pointed out the unreasonableness of such an attitude, he would become infuriated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then he would begin to worry about his future, which seemed not as promising as it did before.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It is true that everybody begins his university career cherishing great ambitions, like a man who sets out on a long journey; and that after a year or two, most students suddenly realize the slowness of their progress, and seeing that graduation is not far off, find themselves in a state of disillusionment.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K had, no doubt, reached this stage in his career.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But his despondency was far greater than was normally found among his fellow students.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I finally decided that the only thing to do was to try to calm him down a little.I said to him that he should do no more work than was necessary.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I told him that for the good of his own great future, he should rest and enjoy himself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Knowing K’s stubbornness, I did not expect to find my task easy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But once begun, I found it far more difficult and exasperating than I had ever imagined.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He held that scholarly knowledge was not his only objective.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What was important, he said, was that he should become a strong person through the exercise of will-power.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Apparently, this could be done only by living in straitened circumstances.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Judged by the standards of a normal person, he was perhaps a little mad.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, straitened circumstances seemed not at all to be strengthening his will-power.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, they were making a neurotic out of him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In desperation, I pretended to be in wholehearted agreement with his views.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It had always been my wish, I said, to lead a life such as his.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
(I was not being totally insincere.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had always found K persuasive in argument, and he could momentarily convince me of almost anything.)",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally, I suggested that he live with me, so that I might learn to lead his kind of life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Because of his stubbornness, I was forced to bow to him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At last, I succeeded in bringing him to the house.There was attached to my room a small anteroom of four mats.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
One had to go through it to get to my room from the front hall.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was not therefore very conveniently situated.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I put K in there.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It had been my intention to share my own room with K, and to leave the other room free for both of us to use as the occasion demanded.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But K would not listen to my suggestion, saying that he would rather have a room of his own, however small it might be.As I said, Okusan was against this arrangement from the first.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In a boarding house, she said, two lodgers would be more convenient than one, and three would be more profitable than two.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But, she pointed out, she was not running a boarding house, and she had no wish to take in another lodger.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I said that my friend would give her no trouble.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Trouble or no trouble, she answered, she disliked having a stranger in the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I was a stranger too, I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Her answer was that she had from the first known that she could trust me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I smiled.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She then changed her tactics.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She said that I would later regret having brought such a person into the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I asked her why she thought so.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was her turn to smile.Indeed, there really was no reason why I should insist on sharing my apartment with K. But I felt that he would hesitate to accept my assistance if I were to offer it to him every month, in the form of money.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He was a very independent-minded person.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For this reason, I thought it advisable to have him live with me, and to give Okusan, without his knowledge, enough money to pay for our food.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I had no wish to tell Okusan about K’s financial difficulties.I did, however, say that I was worried about K’s health.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said that if allowed to keep on living in solitude, he was sure to become more eccentric than ever.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I told her also of the troubles he had had with his foster parents, and of his later expulsion from his original family.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was, I said, in the hope of lending warmth to his cold and lonely life that I wanted him to come and stay with me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Would not Okusan and Ojosan, I asked, look after him with the warm kindness that he so much needed?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan raised no more objections.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I said nothing about this conversation to K. I was glad that he had no inkling of what had been said with regard to his entering our household.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He arrived with a dignified and absent-minded air.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In my normal manner, I received him.Okusan and Ojosan helped him unpack his bags, and were otherwise very kind to him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was very happy—despite the fact that K remained his usual moody self—for I felt that their kindness to him arose out of their regard for me.When I asked K what he thought of his new home, all he said was: “Not bad.” His answer struck me as being somewhat incongruous, considering that he had been living, until then, in a squalid, damp room which faced the north.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His food had been in keeping with his room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As far as I was concerned, he had been raised from the bottom of a dark valley to the top of a sunlit mountain.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
No doubt his stubbornness was partly responsible for his apparent indifference towards the change; but I am sure also that he was being indifferent on principle.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Having grown up under the influence of Buddhist doctrines, he seemed to regard respect for material comfort as some kind of immorality.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Also, having read stories of great priests and Christian saints who were long since dead, he was wont to regard the body and the soul as entities which had to be forced asunder.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, he seemed at times to think that mistreatment of the body was necessary for the glorification of the soul.I decided that the best thing for me to do was to avoid arguing with him at all costs.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I decided to leave the piece of ice out in the sun, and wait until it had melted and turned into warm water.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then, I thought, he would begin to see the error of his ways.Okusan was giving me a similar treatment, and I was gradually becoming more cheerful.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Knowing the efficacy of this treatment when applied to myself, I decided to try it on K. I had known him too long not to know that there was a considerable difference in our characters, but I thought nevertheless that just as my nervousness had become less acute since I entered the household, so also would K be soothed by its atmosphere.K had more will-power than I.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He must have studied twice as much as I did.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, he had greater natural intelligence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I cannot say much concerning his academic standing at the university, since we were in different fields; but at both secondary school and college, where we were in the same class, he was always ahead of me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had indeed come to regard myself as inferior to K in every way.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But when I talked K into moving in with me, I believed that I was for once displaying greater common sense than he.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It seemed to me that he did not see the difference between stubbornness and patience.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I want you to pay attention to what I am now going to say; it is intended for your benefit.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The development—or the destruction—of man’s body and mind depends upon external stimuli.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Unless one is very careful, and unless one sees to it that the intensity of the stimuli is gradually increased, one will find too late that the body, or the mind, has atrophied.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"According to doctors, there is nothing that requires more attention than the human stomach.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Give it nothing but gruel, and you will apparently find one day that it has lost the power to digest anything else.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That is why the doctors tell us to accustom our stomachs to all kinds of food.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I do not think that it is simply a matter of habituation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It is, I think, more a question of increasing the efficiency of the stomach through the gradual adding of stimuli.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You can imagine what will be the effect if the process were reversed.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K was a much abler fellow than I, but he seemed not to see the simple truth of this principle.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He seemed to be under the impression that once one had become accustomed to hardship, one would quickly cease to notice it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The mere repetition of the same stimulus was to him a virtue.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He believed, I think, that there would come a time when he would become insensitive to hardship.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That it might eventually destroy him never entered his head.I wanted to say all this to K. But I knew that he would violently disagree with me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And no doubt, I thought to myself, he would in the course of his argument refer to those men of the past.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Meek as I was in his presence, I would then be obliged to point out the difference between him and them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He would take this as a rebuke, and would advance to a position more extreme than ever before in order to prove his consistency.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And having done this, he would later feel compelled to put into practice what he had maintained in his argument with me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In this respect, he was really quite frightening—and very impressive.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He would wilfully proceed to his own destruction.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But however one looked at him, he was certainly no ordinary fellow.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, I knew his character too well to think that I could tell him what I honestly thought.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, I was afraid that he had become a little neurotic of late; and supposing that I could have worsted him in an argument, he would still have become terribly agitated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was not afraid of quarreling with him, but remembering what pain my own loneliness had given me, I did not have the heart to place K, who was my friend, in a state of lonely isolation such as mine had been—or, worse still, push him into far greater loneliness than I myself had ever experienced.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And so I tried not to be openly critical of his ways even after he had moved in with me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I decided to wait quietly and see what the change of surroundings would do for him.Secretly, I went to Okusan and Ojosan and asked them to talk to K as much as possible.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was my opinion that the silent life K had so far been living had had bad effects on him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not help thinking that his heart, like a piece of iron, had gone rusty from disuse.Okusan laughingly said that K was an unapproachable sort of person.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Ojosan, by way of illustration, told me of an encounter she had had with K. She had apparently gone to K and asked him if there was any fire in his brazier.“No,” he had said.“Well, would you like a fire?”“No, thank you.”“Aren’t you cold?”“Yes, I am.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I don’t need a fire.” And he had refused to discuss the matter any further.I could hardly laugh such an incident off with some such comment as, “Eccentric, isn’t he?” I felt that I owed them some kind of explanation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, it was spring, and a fire was not absolutely necessary.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I could not blame the two ladies for thinking that K was a difficult man to handle.I tried very hard, in the role of perpetual go-between, to establish a harmonious relationship between K and the two ladies.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I happened to be conversing with K, I would ask the ladies to join us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I happened to be with the ladies, then I would try to get K to come out of his room and be with us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Suiting my tactics to the occasion, I did everything I could to bring them together.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K did not like this, of course.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, he would suddenly get up and leave our company without a word.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, he would refuse to come out of his room when I called him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Why is it,” he once asked me, “that you take so much pleasure in useless small talk?” I merely laughed—though I knew in my heart that I was being despised.It is possible that, in a sense, I deserved his contempt.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His point of view of everything was much loftier than mine.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I do not deny this.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But when the loftiness is merely in one’s point of view, then one is hopelessly handicapped as a human being.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I decided that what he needed, above all else, was humanizing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No matter how full one’s head might be with the image of greatness, one was useless, I found out, unless one was a worthy man first.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In an attempt to make him more human, then, I tried to encourage him to spend as much time as possible with the two ladies.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And, I thought, when he had once become accustomed to that atmosphere which the presence of women seems to bring about, he would become less of a recluse and more lively.My experiment seemed gradually to succeed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What had at first seemed difficult of accomplishment became more and more easy.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K, I thought, was learning to acknowledge the existence of a world other than his own.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He said to me one day that women were, after all, not as contemptible as one might think.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K had always expected the same kind of knowledge and education from women as he did from men.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And in his disappointment, he had come to regard them with contempt.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He had not known that there was a way to judge women and a way to judge men.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“If you and I,” I said to him, “were to spend the rest of our lives as bachelors, forever talking to each other, we would advance merely in straight parallel lines.” “Of course,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My mind was full of Ojosan at the time, and my opinions were naturally influenced by this fact.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I said not a word to K about the underlying cause of my remark.It was very pleasing to me to see him gradually emerge from his fortress of books, and to see his heart beginning to thaw.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Such had been my hope when I first brought him to the house, and it was natural that I should be happy to see my plan succeeding so well.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I told Okusan and Ojosan—though not K himself—how happy I was to see the change in him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They seemed pleased too.Although K and I were students in the same faculty, we studied different subjects.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We would therefore leave the house and return to it at different times.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I was the first to get back, I would simply walk through his room to get to my own; but if I happened to return after him, then I would say a word or two to him in passing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K would look up from whatever he was reading when he heard me opening the door, and say, in answer to my greeting: “Did you just get back?” I would nod silently, or say “Yes,” as I walked past his desk.One day, it so happened that I had to go to Kanda on my way home, and I returned much later than usual.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"With hurried steps I walked up to the front door, and slid it open, not without some noise.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Just as I did so, I heard Ojosan’s voice.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was certain that it came from K’s room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Facing the front hall was the morning room, and behind it, Ojosan’s room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To the left of the front hall was K’s room, and then mine.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had lived in the house too long not to be able to tell where the voice was coming from.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Quickly, I closed the door behind me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then Ojosan stopped talking.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
While I was taking off my boots—I had just begun wearing those cumbersome lace-up boots which were then fashionable—there was not a sound in K’s room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I thought this strange.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I began to think that perhaps I had been mistaken.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But when I opened the door to K’s room as usual, I found the two of them seated comfortably, facing each other.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Did you just get back?” said K. Ojosan remained seated, and said: “Welcome home.” It may have been my imagination, but I thought I detected a little stiffness in her simple greeting.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Her tone struck me as being somehow unnatural.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said to Ojosan, “Where’s Okusan?” My question contained no subtle meaning.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I asked it simply because the house seemed unusually quiet.Okusan, it turned out, was not at home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She had gone out with the maid.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K and Ojosan, then, were alone in the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not but wonder at this.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan had never left me alone in the house with Ojosan; and I had lived with them considerably longer than K. I asked Ojosan if Okusan had left on some urgent business.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She merely laughed.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I disliked women who laughed at such times.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I suppose one can dismiss this weakness as something that is common to all young women.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, Ojosan was wont to find cause for laughter in the most trivial things.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When Ojosan saw the expression on my face, however, she became serious again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No, it was nothing urgent, she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As a boarder, I had no right to question her further.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I said no more.I had hardly changed my clothes and settled down in my room when Okusan and the maid returned.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Shortly thereafter, we sat down to dinner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before I came to know the family well, it used to be the custom for the maid to bring all my meals to my room on a tray.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But they soon ceased to treat me like a boarder, and I began to eat regularly with them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When K moved in, therefore, I asked them to invite him to join us at mealtimes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And to show my appreciation for doing as I asked, I bought them a light dining table made of thin wood, with folding legs.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It would seem that such tables are to be found in all houses now, but in those days, there were very few families that owned them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I took the trouble of having one specially made by a furniture maker in Ochanomizu.It was while we were seated around this table, then, that Okusan told me the fish vendor had failed to come that day at the usual hour, and that she had consequently gone out to buy some fish for us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Why, of course, I said to myself, one had to do such things when one had boarders.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Ojosan looked at me, and began to laugh.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She stopped quickly enough when her mother scolded her.Again, about a week later, I returned home to find K and Ojosan talking to each other in his room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On that occasion, Ojosan began to laugh as soon as she saw me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I suppose I should have asked her then what it was that she found so amusing.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Instead, I went straight to my room without saying a word.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I gave K no time to greet me with his usual “Did you just get back?” Very soon afterwards, I thought I heard Ojosan going back to the morning room.At dinner, Ojosan said that I was a strange person.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not ask her why she thought so.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did notice, however, that Okusan was glaring at her.After dinner, I persuaded K to go for a walk with me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From the back of Denzuin Temple, we went around the botanical garden, and returned to the bottom of the slope at Tomizaka.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was a fairly long walk, but we said very little during it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K was by nature less talkative than I. I was not a very talkative person myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But on this occasion, I tried to carry on a conversation with him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wanted mostly to discuss the family with whom we were staying.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wanted to know how K regarded Okusan and Ojosan.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But to my questions he gave replies so vague that one could not tell whether they came from the mountains or the sea.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Despite their vagueness, however, they were rather simple answers.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The subject of his special study seemed to interest him more than the two ladies.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, our second-year examinations were drawing near, and I suppose that from the point of view of a normal person, K was behaving more like a student than I was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remember that he amazed me—I was not very scholarly—with references to Swedenborg and so on.When we had successfully completed our examinations, Okusan was very pleased for our sake, and said: “Well, you now have only one year to go.” Ojosan too, who was Okusan’s one real pride, was due to graduate soon.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K remarked to me that women seemed to graduate without having learned a thing.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He attached no importance whatsoever to those things which Ojosan was studying outside of school, such as the koto, flower arrangement, and sewing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I laughed at his stupidity.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once more, I told him that his was not the proper way to judge the worth of a woman.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He did not argue with me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, he did not appear to be convinced.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
This pleased me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His attitude, which seemed to suggest that the subject did not merit serious discussion, I took to be an indication of the contempt with which he still regarded women.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I decided that Ojosan, whom I looked upon as the embodiment of womanly qualities, was of little significance to K. It is obvious to me now that I was already more than a little jealous of him.I suggested to K that we should go somewhere during the summer holidays.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He said that he was not very anxious to leave Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was certainly in no position to go anywhere he liked, but there was nothing to prevent him from joining me if I invited him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I asked him why he did not wish to go away.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was no particular reason, he said; he simply wanted to stay and read books.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I pointed out that it would be far better for our health if we went to some cool resort and read our books there.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Well, he said, if that was why I wanted to go away, then I should go alone.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I did not want to leave him in the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had already come to regard his growing familiarity with the two ladies with some discomfort.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“But wasn’t that what you wanted?” you might ask.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Didn’t you force K on them?” Certainly, I was a fool.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan, seeing that we would never reach an agreement if left alone, stepped in and helped us make up our minds.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At last it was decided that the two of us should go to the coast of Boshu.K had not traveled very much, and it was my first trip to Boshu.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Knowing nothing about that part of the country, therefore, we got off the boat as soon as we could.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We found ourselves—I remember quite clearly—in a place called Hota.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It may be quite different now, but in those days it was a very unpleasant fishing village.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was the smell of fish everywhere, and whenever we tried to bathe, we were beaten down by the waves and knocked about among huge pebbles until we emerged with our hands and feet quite raw.I soon tired of the place.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But K showed neither approval nor disapproval.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Despite the fact that he never came out of the sea unwounded, he seemed, at least outwardly, quite indifferent to his surroundings.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally, I managed to convince him of the unpleasantness of Hota, and we left for Tomiura.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From there, we went to Nako.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That part of the coast was by then very popular with students, and we found no difficulty in finding suitable places for bathing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K and I often sat on the rocks near the shore, and watched the sea stretching far beyond towards the horizon, or the sandy bottom visible through the water nearby.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The scene below the rocks was especially beautiful.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We could see brightly colored fish, some of them red and some of them deep blue, which one would never find in the fish markets, swimming about in the clear water.Often, I took books with me to the rocks, and read them there.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K, on the other hand, usually did nothing, and sat near me in silence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not decide whether he was meditating, or drinking in the beauty around him, or simply daydreaming.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I would occasionally look up and ask him what he was doing.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Nothing,” he would say.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Often, I found myself thinking how nice it would be if the person sitting so quietly by my side was not K, but Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Unfortunately, this pleasant thought invariably led me further to the point where I would begin to wonder whether K was not sitting there indulging in exactly the same reverie.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then I would become restless, and cease to enjoy the book I happened to be reading; and I would begin to shout in a loud voice.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could find no satisfaction in such mild forms of emotional release as reciting a poem or singing a song.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Instead, I shouted as an uncontrolled savage might have done.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once, I grabbed K’s neck from behind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“What would you do,” I said, “if I pushed you into the sea?” K did not move.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Without looking back, he said: “That would be pleasant.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Please do.” Quickly, I withdrew the hand that had been holding his neck.It would seem that by then, K’s nervous condition had improved considerably.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My nerves, on the other hand, had become increasingly high-strung.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I envied K who was so much calmer than I. I hated him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What annoyed me was that he took no notice of me, no matter what I did.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I took this as a sign of K’s self-confidence.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But that K had grown more confident of late gave me little satisfaction.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wanted to discover the real cause of the change in him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Had he simply become optimistic about his studies and his future career once more?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If so, there was no reason why there should be any rivalry between us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, I would find satisfaction in the fact that my efforts to help him had not been in vain.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But if his new serenity had come as a result of his contact with Ojosan, then I would find it impossible to forgive him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K seemed totally unaware of my love for Ojosan.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, I had been careful not to be too obvious about it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But there is no denying that in such matters, K was quite insensitive.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I must confess that it was because I was aware of this insensitivity in him that I was less reluctant than I might have been to invite him to live with us.I decided to confide my secret to K. Actually, I had been wanting to do so for some time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I had found myself incapable, when talking to K, of seizing, or creating, the right moment to introduce the subject casually.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I think about it, my acquaintances in those days were all rather odd.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There was not one among them that showed any inclination to discuss his own romantic problems without restraint.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I suppose many of them really had nothing to talk about.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, it would seem that it was the custom not to exchange confidences concerning women.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You, who are used to a more liberal atmosphere, must think this strange.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whether we were still under the influence of Confucian teachings, or whether we were only being shy, I shall leave you to decide for yourself.K and I were close friends, and there was little that we did not feel free to discuss with each other.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On rare occasions, we would talk about love, but never was the subject allowed to go beyond abstract theorizing.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And as I said, it was very seldom discussed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We hardly ever talked of matters other than our future careers, our ambitions, means of disciplining our minds, our scholarly interests, books, and so on.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Though we were good friends, there was a stiff formality about our friendship, and it was difficult for me to break through this wall of formality.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The character of our friendship had already been formed, and we could come closer only in a very limited way.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Many times, I was on the verge of telling him about Ojosan, but always, I was checked by the insurmountable wall that stood between us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Often, in exasperation, I would feel like hammering a hole somewhere in his head, so that a gentle, warm breeze might blow into it.All this must seem quite absurd to you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was nevertheless in great torment at the time.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was no less timid than I had been in Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I watched K closely, hoping that he would give me a chance to confide in him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But not once did he emerge from his forbidding aloofness.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was as though his heart was encrusted with a layer of black lacquer, so thick that no warm blood could ever penetrate through it.There were times, however, when I found some consolation in his apparent high-mindedness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I would regret having suspected such a person, and inwardly apologize to him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I would then begin to hate myself for my baseness.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was never contrite for long, however.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For very soon, I would be assailed by the same old doubts.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At such times, I would compare myself with K—always unfavorably, of course, since the desire to compare originated in doubt.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Surely, I would tell myself, he is better-looking than I; and his nature too, which seemed so much less fussy than my own, must be more appealing to the opposite sex.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As for his absent-minded air, would not women say that that was a sign of manly strength?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, we were studying different subjects, but I knew only too well that in intellectual ability, I was not his equal either.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"All in all, I would decide, I was a rather unappealing fellow in comparison.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And so my momentary relief would soon be replaced by my old fears.K noticed my unsettled state, and said that it would be all right with him if we went back to Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When he said this, the idea of returning to Tokyo suddenly became distasteful to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It is possible that I did not want to let him go back.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, we decided to continue our trip.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We went around the headland of Boshu.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Groaning in the heat of the mid-summer sun, we walked on.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The walk began to seem quite senseless to me, and I said so, in a half-joking manner, to K. “We are walking because we have legs,” he answered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When it got too hot for us, we would take our clothes off, and jump into the sea.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What with the swimming and the broiling heat, we were completely exhausted by the end of the day.Such strenuous walking in the heat cannot but affect one’s body.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It is not like being ill. Rather, one feels as though one’s soul has found for itself a strange home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I talked to K as usual, but my feelings had somehow changed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My affection and my hatred for K acquired a character peculiar to that journey on foot.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What I mean is that perhaps because of the heat, the swimming, and the walking, our relationship shifted temporarily to a different plane.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We were like two far-traveling peddlers who had met by chance on the road.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We talked to each other, but we said nothing that was of serious concern to us.In this way, we finally reached Choshi.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was, however, one exceptional incident which I still remember.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before leaving Boshu, we stopped at a place called Kominato, and went to see the Bay of Tai.6 Many years have passed since then, and I have never been interested in such things, so I cannot remember very clearly; but it seems that it was at Kominato that Nichiren7 was born.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"According to the local legend, two tai were thrown up on the beach at the time of his birth.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In deference to this legend, the men of the village have always abstained from fishing in the bay.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Hearing that the bay was full of tai for this reason, we hired a small boat and went out to look at them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was enthralled by the scene under the water, and I felt that I would never tire of watching the violet-tinged fish twisting and turning beneath the waves.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K, however, seemed not as interested as I was in the fish.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He seemed rather to be thinking about Nichiren.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We had found a temple in the village by the name of Tanjo-ji.8 I presume it was called this because Nichiren had been born there, in Kominato.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was certainly an impressive temple.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K said that he wanted to meet the chief priest.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To tell the truth, we were at the time a shabby-looking pair.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K looked especially disreputable.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His cap had been blown away during the hike along the coast, and he was now wearing a sedge hat.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Our clothes were soiled, and smelled of sweat.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did not think that the priests would welcome our company, and I said so to K. But he was stubborn, and would not listen to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“If you don’t want to come in, you can wait out here,” he said, when we had reached the gate of the temple.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was obliged to accompany him into the front hall.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was quite certain that we would be refused admittance.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I was mistaken.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Priests, I discovered, are on the whole more gracious than one might expect.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We were shown into a large and fine room, and there received by the chief priest.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In those days, my interests were very different from K’s, and so I did not listen very carefully to what K and the priest were saying; but I do remember that K asked him many questions about Nichiren.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When the priest remarked that Nichiren was such a master of the grass script9 that he was called “Grass” Nichiren, I remember that K, who was a poor calligrapher himself, looked impatient.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I suppose he regarded such facts as irrelevant and trivial.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Obviously, he wanted the priest to say something more profound about the great man.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I do not know whether K was satisfied with the conversation or not: at any rate, when we came out of the temple, he began to give me a lecture on Nichiren.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was too tired and hot to be much interested, and my comments were half-hearted and bored.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Eventually, I stopped saying anything at all.It was, I think, the following evening that we had an argument.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We had had our dinner at the inn, and were preparing to go to bed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I discovered that he had resented my lack of interest in his comments on Nichiren the day before.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Saying that anyone who had no spiritual aspirations was an idiot, he began to attack me for my frivolity.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My apprehensions concerning Ojosan had made me more sensitive than I might have been to K’s almost insulting remarks.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I began to defend myself.I remember that I used constantly the word “human” in defending my position and in attacking his.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K insisted that I was trying to hide all my weaknesses behind this word.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Now, I see that he was right.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But in trying to point out his limitations I had become aggressive, and I was in no mood to be objective about myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I became more dogmatic than ever.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally, he asked me why it was that I considered him unhuman.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I told him that he was indeed human—perhaps too much so; but that one would never guess this from his words.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, I said, he was trying too hard to live and act in a way that was not natural to human beings.When I said this, he did not argue with me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He merely said that it was his own lack of training that was responsible for the low opinion I seemed to have of what he was trying to accomplish.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Not only did his remark take the wind out of my sails, but I began to be sorry for what I had said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I stopped arguing then.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K’s tone also became more quiet.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“If you only knew those men of the past as I know them,” he said sadly, “you would not be so critical of me.” The men of the past that he was referring to were not, of course, heroic figures in the conventional sense, but ascetics who had tyrannized over their flesh for the freedom of their souls, who had lashed their bodies so that they might find the way.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“How I wish,” he said, “that you could understand my suffering.”K and I went to bed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The next day, we resumed our sweaty and tortuous walk.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once more, our relationship became like that of two peddlers on the road.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"During the walk, however, I thought now and then of the argument of the night before, and cursed myself for having missed such a good opportunity to confide in him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I should have been more honest, I said to myself, and instead of criticizing him for not being human and so on, I should have admitted to him openly the true cause of my grievance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After all, it was Ojosan that was at the bottom of my troubles, and, for my own good, I should not have tried to hide this fact under half-true generalities.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But, I must confess, the tone of our friendship had become intellectualized, and I did not have the courage to rebel openly against the established pattern of our relationship.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You may attribute this weakness on my part to affectation or vanity.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"So long as you try to understand that it was not the ordinary kind of affectation or vanity, I shall not mind.Burnt almost black by the sun, we returned to Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My state of mind had changed greatly by then, and such petty considerations as K’s human qualities or his lack of them had ceased to worry me very much.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K, too, had lost most of his piousness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I doubt that the problem of body and soul was worrying him at all then.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Like two barbarians, we stared at the busy scene around us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We stopped at Ryogoku and, despite the heat, treated ourselves to a meal of game hen.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This seemed to fortify K, and he suggested that we walk all the way to Koishikawa.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had a more robust constitution than K, and I assented readily enough.Okusan, when she saw us, was shocked by our appearance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Not only were we black, but the walking had made us terribly thin.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She soon recovered from her shock, however, and was good enough to say that we looked very healthy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“But you are so inconsistent,” said Ojosan, and laughed at her mother.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I felt cheerful, forgetting that I had left Tokyo not without resentful feelings toward her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After all, I had not seen her for some time, and the occasion was, I suppose, a happy one.Moreover, I soon noticed that Ojosan’s manner towards me had changed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After such a long absence, there was much that had to be done before we could settle down once more to our normal routine.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The two ladies came to our aid.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan, of course, was very helpful.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But what pleased me particularly was that Ojosan seemed to pay greater attention to my needs than she did to K’s.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Now, if she had done so at all crudely, I should have been embarrassed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, I might even have been annoyed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But she showed great sense here, and there was only a delicate suggestion of favoritism, which made me very happy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She was kind to us both, but she simply gave me the greater share of her natural kindness, in such a way that only I noticed it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K had no reason to be annoyed therefore, and as far as he was concerned, nothing out of the ordinary had happened.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had scored a victory over K, and my heart was filled with a sense of triumph.Summer finally came to an end.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"About the middle of September, we began once more to attend lectures at the university.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Our schedules were again different, and we came and went at different times during the day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Approximately three days a week, I remember, K got home before me, but not once during the first few weeks of term did I find Ojosan in his room when I returned.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K would greet me with his customary “Did you just get back?” My reply too would be mechanical, simple, and almost meaningless.It so happened that one morning—it was about the middle of October, I think—I overslept, and having no time to put on my uniform, I rushed off in Japanese dress.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And instead of the usual lace-up boots, I wore my sandals.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Normally, on that day of the week, my lectures ended earlier than K’s, and so I went home assuming that K would not yet be back.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I opened the front door, however, I heard K’s voice.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And then the sound of Ojosan’s laughter reached my ears.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Since I was wearing sandals that day, and not those boots which took so long to unlace, I was very soon in K’s room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I found K sitting at his desk as usual.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But Ojosan was no longer there.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had opened the door just in time to catch a glimpse of her fleeing figure.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I asked K why he was back so early.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He had not been feeling very well, he said, and so had decided to stay at home.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I went to my room and sat down.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A few minutes later, Ojosan came in with a cup of tea.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Welcome home,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was too awkward a fellow to smile at her and make some such comment as, “Well, why did you run away from me just now?” And of course, I was not the sort to make light of such an incident.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She stayed with me for only a moment or two.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She then got up, and left my room by the verandah.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She stopped outside K’s room, and exchanged a few words with him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They were, I gathered, continuing the conversation that my return had interrupted.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Not having heard the earlier part of it, I could not guess what it was all about.As time passed, Ojosan’s manner became more nonchalant, and I noted that she was becoming more openly friendly with K. Even when I was at home, she would call K’s name from the verandah, and then go into his room for a long chat.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But, you would say, how else could two people living under the same roof behave?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I will admit that she could hardly avoid going into his room; there were, after all, such things as his letters and his laundry that she had to take to him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But to me, who was so intent on monopolizing her company, it seemed that she was seeing him far more than was necessary.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, indeed, I could not help the impression that she was purposely avoiding my company in order to be with K. You may ask, “Why then did you not ask him to leave the house?” But it was I that had forced K to come and live with me for his own good.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To ask him to leave would have been an unprincipled thing to do, and humiliating.On a cold, rainy day in November, I walked home as usual through the grounds of the temple of Konnyaku-Emma and up the narrow lane that led to the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My overcoat was wet, and I was chilled.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K was not in his room, but there was a good fire going in his brazier.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Looking forward to seeing as good a fire in my own brazier, I hurried to my room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But there were only cold, white ashes where I had expected to find red-hot charcoal.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was overcome with annoyance.I then heard footsteps approaching my door.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was Okusan.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She saw me standing silently in the middle of the room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She must have felt sorry for me, for she came in, and helped me change into my Japanese dress.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I complained of the cold, she went into the next room, and returned with K’s brazier.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I asked Okusan if K had already been back.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Yes, he had, she replied, but had gone out again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K’s lectures were held later than mine that day, and so I wondered why it was that he had come back before me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan said that he probably had some business to attend to.I sat down, and tried to read.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There was not a sound to be heard in the house The cold of early winter and my own loneliness seemed to grip my whole body.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I soon put my book down, and stood up.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You see, I had the sudden desire to go somewhere that was gay.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It seemed to have stopped raining, but the sky still looked cold and heavy, like a sheet of lead.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I decided to take my umbrella out with me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I went down the hill towards the east, alongside the back wall of the Arsenal.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The city authorities had not yet undertaken the improvement of roads in that area, and so the slope was then very much steeper than it is now.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The road was also narrower, and not as straight as it is today.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What with bad drainage and big buildings on the south side which blocked the sun, the road became terribly muddy when you reached the valley.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was particularly bad between the narrow stone bridge and Yanagicho.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You had to watch your step even if you were wearing high rain clogs or Wellingtons.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There was a narrow strip of well-trodden ground in the middle of the road which was comparatively dry, and you had to walk carefully so as not to step beyond it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was not more than a foot or two wide, so it was like walking on a woman’s sash which had been stretched along the road.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Slowly and in single file, the pedestrians made their way through the mud.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was on this narrow sash that I met K. I had not noticed him walking towards me, since keeping to the path had required all my attention.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Seeing that someone was in front of me, I looked up, and found myself standing face to face with K. “Where have you been?” I asked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Just down the road,” he answered, in his usual curt tone.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We squeezed past each other.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And then I discovered that a young woman had been standing a pace or two behind K. Being shortsighted, I had to peer at her before I realized, to my amazement, that I was looking at Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She blushed slightly, and greeted me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Women in those days did not wear their hair over their foreheads, but twisted it in snake-like coils on top of their heads.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I stood still and stared vacantly at her head.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then I remembered that one of us had to step aside to let the other pass.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I moved quickly and stepped into the mud, thus allowing Ojosan to get by.I finally reached the main street of Yanagicho, but once there, I could not decide where to go.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It did not seem to matter where I went.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I walked about angrily and aimlessly in the mud, not caring whether I got splashed or not.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I then went home.I asked K if he had gone out with Ojosan.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No, he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He went on to explain that he had met her by chance in Masagocho, and so had walked home with her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had to restrain myself from asking him more questions.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At dinner, however, I could not resist asking Ojosan where she had been that afternoon.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She answered with a laugh—that laugh of hers which I hated so much.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then she said, “I’ll let you guess.” I was a touchy fellow in those days, and I was considerably irritated at being treated in such an offhand manner by a young woman.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The only person around the table who seemed to notice this was Okusan.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K appeared as usual indifferent to his surroundings.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As for Ojosan, I could not be sure whether she was annoying me on purpose or whether she was being innocently playful.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For a young woman, she was on the whole a considerate sort of person, but there is no denying that she had some traits which were common to all young women and which I disliked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, I began to notice these traits only after K had moved into the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Perhaps, I told myself, they were no more than figments of my imagination, caused by my jealousy of K; or perhaps they were quite real, and sprang from the coquetry of a young woman in the presence of two men.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Mind you, I have no intention of denying that I was jealous.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And as I have often said to you, I was quite aware then of the presence of great jealousy in my love for Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, I became jealous for reasons which must have seemed quite trivial to others.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I am digressing here, but don’t you think that this kind of jealousy is a necessary concomitant of love?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I have noticed that since my marriage, I have become less and less subject to fits of jealousy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I have noticed also that my love is by no means as passionate as it once was.Once more, I was tempted to tear the secret out of my heart and hurl it at her breast.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"By “her,” I do not mean Ojosan, but Okusan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I began again to think of asking Okusan for her daughter’s hand.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I could not bring myself to speak to her about marriage.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You must think me a very irresolute person.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That you may do so does not worry me very much.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
All I want to point out here is that my irresolution was not due to lack of will-power on my part.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before K moved in with us, it was my fear of being duped that had stopped me from approaching Okusan about her daughter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After K’s entrance on the scene, however, it was the suspicion that Ojosan might prefer him to me that was responsible for my inaction.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I decided, you understand, that if K did indeed mean more to her than I did, then my love would not be worth declaring.You must not think that I was frightened of being humiliated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I simply abhorred the idea of living with a woman who had secretly preferred someone else to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There are many men, I grant, who seem happy enough to marry women who strike their fancy, not caring whether or not they themselves are found satisfactory by the other party.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was firmly convinced that such men were either far more worldly and cynical than I, or were contemptible dullards who had no understanding of the true nature of love.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Also, I was too ardently in love to tell myself, for instance, that once we were married, all problems would somehow disappear.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In other words, I was far from lacking high-minded convictions about love; but when I discovered that it necessarily involved some decisive action on my part, I became hesitant, timid, and rather devious.During the long period of time that we lived in the same house, there were of course many opportunities for me to tell Ojosan directly how I felt towards her, but I purposely ignored them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was then very conscious of the fact—perhaps too much so—that to speak to Ojosan about marriage before I had spoken to Okusan would be a flagrant breach of Japanese custom.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, it was not this alone that prevented me from confessing my love to Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was also afraid that if she did not by any chance want me for a husband, she would not say so outright.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought that Japanese people, especially Japanese women, lacked the courage to be bluntly truthful on such occasions.And so I stood still, not daring to take a step in any direction.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was like a sick person in bed, who falls into an uneasy sleep during the day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He opens his eyes as he comes out of his sleep, and sees clearly what is going on around him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then for a moment or two, he is overcome by the feeling that in the midst of a world that moves, he alone is still.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was beset by the same kind of fear, though the others did not know it.The old year came to an end.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One day, during the New Year season, Okusan said that we all ought to play a game of cards, and asked K if he would like to invite a friend to join us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“But I have no friends,” he answered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan was shocked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K indeed had no friends.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There were, of course, a few students with whom he had a nodding acquaintance, but he knew none of them well enough to ask them to join him and the family in a game of cards.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan then turned to me and said, “Well, in that case, why don’t you bring someone along?” I gave a noncommittal reply, since I was in no mood for merry games.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That evening, however, Ojosan dragged K and me out of our rooms, and forced us to play cards with them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Since there were no guests, the gathering was small, and we had a very quiet game.10 K, who was unused to such lighthearted pastimes, sat like a block of wood.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said to him, “Don’t you know the Hyakunin Isshu poems?” “Not very well,” he answered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Ojosan must have thought that I was being unkind to K. She began conspicuously to help him whenever she could, and very soon, the game developed into a contest between me and these two.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I might have picked a quarrel with them but for K’s manner, which showed no elation when Ojosan started taking his side.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We were able to finish the game peacefully.It was, I think, two or three days later that Okusan and Ojosan left the house early in the morning, saying that they were going to visit a relative of theirs in Ichigaya.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K and I remained in the house, since we were still on holiday.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had no inclination to go outside.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I sat down by the brazier, and resting my elbows on it, began to think in a vague and disconnected way.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K, who was in his room, was also very quiet.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Neither of us gave the other any indication that he was still in the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The silence did not worry me, however: both K and I were accustomed to it.At about ten o’clock, the door between our rooms was suddenly opened, and I saw K looking at me from the doorway.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“What are you thinking about?” he said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not in all honesty say that I was thinking about anything at all.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If the confusion in my mind then could have been called “thought,” then I suppose I might have answered: “Ojosan.” And I might have added: “I have been thinking about Okusan too; and, as a matter of fact, about you, who seem recently to have made matters far more complicated than ever for me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Yes, you are a haunting, albeit vague, figure that refuses to leave me alone.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I have been thinking of you as a confounded nuisance.” But I could hardly say all this to his face.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I continued to look at him in silence.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K then strode into the room, and sat down opposite me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I moved my elbows away from the edge of the brazier, and pushed it just a little nearer to him.K began to talk to me about Okusan and Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was surprised, since he had never shown any inclination before to talk about them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Whom are they visiting in Ichigaya?” I said that in all likelihood they had gone to see Ojosan’s aunt.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“What does this aunt do?” he asked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I explained that she also was a soldier’s wife.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“But is it not the custom,” he said, “for women to pay New Year visits after the middle of January?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wonder why they went so early?” “I have no idea,” I was forced to reply.K continued to question me about Okusan and Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Eventually, I found myself unable to answer his questions, which became increasingly complicated and personal.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I thought his behavior not so much irritating as odd.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Previously, it had always been I that had tried to introduce the subject of the two ladies into our conversation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not but take notice, therefore, of the sudden interest that K was showing in them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I asked him finally, “Why is it that today, in particular, you are asking me all these questions?” He became suddenly very quiet.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I saw that his mouth was trembling.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K was normally a man of few words.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He also had the habit of opening and shutting his lips like a stutterer before he said anything, as though they were not altogether under the control of his will.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Perhaps this difficulty was partly responsible for the impression of weightiness that his words conveyed to the listener.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His voice, when it broke through the barrier, was twice as strong as that of the average man.Seeing the trembling of his lips, I knew that he was about to say something.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But, of course, I had no inkling of what he was going to say.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And so I was shocked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Imagine my reaction when K, in his heavy way, confessed to me his agonized love for Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt as if I had been turned into stone by a magician’s wand.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not even move my lips as K had done.Exactly what the emotion was that I felt then, I am not sure.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Perhaps it was fear; or perhaps it was terrible pain.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whatever it was, its physical effect was to make me feel rigid from head to toe, as though I were a piece of stone or iron.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I do not think that I even breathed then.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Fortunately, this condition did not last long.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A moment or two later, I began to feel alive again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And my first thought was: “He’s beaten me to it!” Beyond this, however, I could not think of anything to do or say.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I suppose I was not yet composed enough to think coherently.I sat still, feeling the cold sweat seeping through my clothes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In his usual ponderous manner, K continued with his confession.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The pain within me was almost unbearable.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought, “Surely, it must show on my face?” Indeed, the way I felt then could not have been any less obvious than a large advertisement stuck on my head, and I am sure that even K, had the conditions been normal, would have observed it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I suppose he was so busy talking about his own troubles that he had no time to watch my reaction to his words.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"His confession was uttered in the same monotonous tone from beginning to end, and its very ponderousness imparted to the speaker an air of immovable strength.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not listen too closely to what he was saying.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For my heart seemed all the while to be crying out, “What shall I do?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What shall I do?” I was nevertheless fully aware of the tone of his voice, which seemed to drone on and on interminably and to beat against my consciousness like the waves of the sea.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That is why I felt then not only torment but a kind of fear.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was the fear of a man who sees before him an opponent stronger than himself.When finally K stopped talking, I found myself unable to say anything.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I want you to understand that I was not silent because I was debating with myself whether I should make a similar confession to K, or whether it would be wiser policy to say nothing about my love for Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was simply unable to speak.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, I had no desire to break the silence.At lunch we faced each other across the table.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The maid waited on us.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It seemed to me that the food was unusually tasteless.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K and I hardly spoke to each other all through the meal.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We had no idea when Okusan and Ojosan would return.We went back to our rooms.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K was as quiet as he had been that morning.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I also sat still, deep in thought.I told myself that I should be honest with K, and tell him that I too had fallen in love with Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not help feeling, however, that it was now too late to do so.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I began to curse myself for not having interrupted K’s confession with one of my own.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I had done that, I thought, I might have outmaneuvered him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The fact that I had not even tried to tell him the truth about myself after he had stopped talking now seemed a terrible mistake.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, I felt that to begin confiding in him at this late stage would somehow be inappropriate: it would seem unnatural, perhaps contrived.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I saw no way out of the dilemma.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My head seemed to throb with despair and regret.I wished that K would once more open the door and stride into my room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That morning, K had taken me by surprise, and I had been totally unprepared.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wanted the same scene repeated, so that this time, I might receive K with the initiative on my side.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Time and again I glanced at the door, but it did not open.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The silence in K’s room seemed eternal.Eventually, I was driven almost to distraction by the quiet.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could not prevent myself from wondering nervously what K was thinking in the next room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before that day, we had spent many hours not making a sound, and I had found that the longer the silence lasted the easier it became to forget K’s existence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That it should have had the opposite effect on me that afternoon shows how frayed my nerves were.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I might have stood up and opened the door to K’s room myself, it is true; but this I could not do.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Having lost the opportunity that morning to unburden myself to K, I was forced to wait passively for another opportunity to present itself.I began to feel that if I stayed in the room any longer, I might suddenly lose control and rush into K’s room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And so I got up and went out to the verandah.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From there I went into the morning room, where, for lack of anything better to do, I poured some hot water from the kettle on the brazier into a cup, and drank it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then I went to the front hall.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And thus managing to avoid K’s room, I made my way into the street.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Needless to say, I did not care where I went so long as I was not in my room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Aimlessly, I walked about the streets that were bright with New Year decorations.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And no matter how much I walked, K remained the sole object of my thoughts.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I want you to understand that I was not walking in order to forget K. Indeed, one might say that I was wandering about the streets in pursuit of K’s image.I must confess that K was a puzzle to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I asked myself: “Why did K confide in me at all?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Why did he allow his love for the girl to become so intense that he could no longer keep it a secret?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What has happened to the K that I once knew?” I could not find an easy answer to any of these questions.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I knew that he was strong-minded, serious, and sincere.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But there was much that I did not know about him; and I realized then that before I could decide what I should do, I had to know much more than I did about K. At the same time, I felt inside me a strange fear—amounting almost to a superstitious dread—of the person that had become my rival.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"With the image of K sitting still in his room constantly before my mind’s eye, I walked about the streets in confusion.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I thought I could hear a voice whispering into my ear: “You’ll never get rid of him .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.” Perhaps I was beginning to think of him as a kind of devil.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once, I even had the feeling that he would haunt me for the rest of my life.When I reached home, exhausted, I noticed that his room was as quiet as ever.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One would have thought that there was no one in it.Soon afterwards, I heard the wheels of rickshaws approaching the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In those days, rickshaw wheels did not have rubber tires as they do now.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They were therefore unpleasantly noisy, and one could hear them from quite a distance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A moment or two later, the rickshaws stopped in front of the house.It was only about half an hour after this that we were called to dinner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As I passed Ojosan’s door on my way to the dining room, I saw the ladies’ going-out dresses lying in colorful disarray on the floor.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
They had apparently hurried home so that they might prepare our dinner.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan’s kindness, however, was wasted on us.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"During the meal, I behaved as though words were too precious a commodity to squander, and I was very brusque with the ladies.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K was even more taciturn than I was.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The ladies on the other hand, having returned from a rare outing, were unusually gay, which made our gloomy behavior all the more noticeable in contrast.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan asked me if anything was wrong.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I told her that I was not feeling well.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I was being quite truthful, I assure you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then Ojosan asked K the same question.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K gave a different answer: he was simply not in a talkative mood, he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Why not?” she asked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I lifted my eyes, which felt dull and heavy, and looked at K. I was very curious as to what he would say.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once more, his lips were trembling slightly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To innocent eyes, it must have seemed that he was only having his usual difficulty with words.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Ojosan laughed, and said that he must have been thinking about something very profound.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K blushed slightly.I went to bed earlier than usual that night.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At about ten o’clock, Okusan, remembering that I had said I was not feeling well, kindly brought me some buckwheat gruel.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She found my room in darkness when she opened the door.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Well!” she said, looking in.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Through the other door, which was closed, a shaft of light from the lamp on K’s desk sneaked in.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He was apparently still up.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan sat down by my bed, and holding out the cup of gruel, said: “Here, drink this.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It will warm you up.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You have probably caught a cold.” I dared not refuse, and drank the thick liquid while she watched.I lay in the dark thinking until the early hours of the morning.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"All I could think about, of course, was the problem of K and Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then suddenly, I wanted to know what K was doing in his room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Almost involuntarily, I called out, “Hey!” “Yes?” he answered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"So K had not yet gone to sleep either, I thought.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Haven’t you gone to bed yet?” I said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He answered simply, “I will soon.” Then I said, “What are you doing?” This time, there was no reply.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Five or six minutes later, I heard him open the cupboard door, then spread out the bedding on the floor.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“What time is it?” I asked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Twenty past one,” replied K. I heard him blow out the lamp.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The house was now completely dark.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt suddenly the silence around me.But I could not go to sleep.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My eyes would not close, and they stared into the darkness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once more, I heard my own voice cry out, “Hey!” Again, K answered, “Yes?” Not being able to restrain myself any longer, I said: “Look here, I want to have a good talk with you .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"you know, about what you said this morning.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"How about it?” I had no wish, of course, to carry on a complicated conversation through the closed door: all I wanted was a simple answer from K. But he became noncommittal all of a sudden.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Well, perhaps .",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".” he said, quietly and unwillingly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once more, I was stricken with fear.K’s attitude remained noncommittal all through the following day, and the day after that.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He showed absolutely no sign of wanting to talk to me again about Ojosan.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, we were given no opportunity to have such a talk.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"So long as Okusan and Ojosan were in the house, we could not very well have a long conversation of so involved and private a nature without interruption.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was quite aware of this.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Nevertheless, I was irritated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Having prepared myself for another talk with K, I was in no mood for protracted silence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I decided finally to bring up the subject myself, rather than wait for him to do so, at the earliest opportunity.Quietly, I watched the conduct of the two ladies.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It showed no change, and I was satisfied that K had confided in me only: I was certain that neither Ojosan herself nor her strict and observant mother knew K’s secret.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was relieved.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"With the relief came the conviction that it would be better to wait for an opportunity to present itself naturally and be sure not to miss it, than to approach K impatiently and force him to discuss the affair with me.I may have given you the impression that my reaching the decision to be patient was a simple process.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was nothing of the sort.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For a long time, I could not make up my mind: my mental state then could be likened to a tide, which ebbs and flows continually.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was not certain as to how I should interpret K’s calm and noncommittal manner.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I even wondered if what the two ladies said and did truly expressed their thoughts.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I asked myself: “Can one expect the complicated mechanism of the human mind to betray its purposes so obviously, as though it were some kind of clock?” In short, please understand that it was after a great deal of vacillation that I finally decided to wait for the right moment to talk to K. Mind you, my decision by no means eased my troubled mind.Our holidays were at last over.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On days that our lectures coincided, we walked to the university together.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We often walked home together too.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Outwardly, we were as friendly as ever; but I am sure each of us was very much immersed in his own problems.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One day, as we were walking home, I suddenly asked him: “Am I the only one that knows your secret?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Or have you told Okusan and Ojosan too?” What tactics I would adopt in the future depended, I thought, on his answer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He answered that he had told no one but me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"So I was right after all, I said to myself, feeling rather pleased.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I knew very well that he was more brazen than I.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He was also more bold.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the other hand, I did trust him in a strange way.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Even the fact of his having deceived his foster parents for three years had by no means impaired my confidence in him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, I had come to trust him more because of it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Despite my suspicious nature, then, I felt no inclination to doubt his word.“What do you intend to do?” I asked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Are you going to keep your love for Ojosan a secret, or are you going to do something about it?” This time, he gave no reply.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He lowered his eyes, and went on walking.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Please don’t hide anything from me,” I begged him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Please tell me what you intend to do.” He said, “There is no need to hide anything from you.” But he refused to tell me what I wanted to know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could hardly stop him in the middle of the street and force him to be more explicit.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We walked on in silence.Not many days later, I paid one of my rare visits to the university library.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had been told by my supervisor to acquaint myself, before the following week, with certain facts concerning my field of specialization.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had to get up from my seat in the reading room and return to the stacks two or three times before I could locate what I wanted.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I sat down at the end of the large desk and began to read carefully the article in the newly arrived foreign journal.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The sun shone through the window, warming the upper part of my body.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then suddenly, I heard someone whispering my name from the other side of the desk.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I looked up, and saw K standing there.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He leaned over the desk so that he could get closer to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As you know, we were not permitted to disturb others in the library by talking too loudly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K was therefore doing what any other student would have done in a similar situation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Nevertheless, K’s behavior gave me an odd sensation.“Studying?” he asked, still whispering.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“There was something I had to look up,” I said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K would not move.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His face was only a few inches away from mine.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Come out for a walk,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I will,” I said, “but you will have to wait.” “All right,” he said, and sat down in the empty chair opposite me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I found that I could not concentrate on the article any more.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was disturbed by the idea that K had come to discuss something serious with me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I gave up trying to read, and closing the magazine, I made as if to get up.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Calmly, K asked, “Finished?” “No,” I answered, “but it doesn’t matter.” I returned the magazine and left the library with K.We had no particular destination in mind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We walked through Tatsuokacho towards Ikenohata, and then went into Ueno Park.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He suddenly began to talk about the affair.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Judging by the way he introduced the subject, it would seem that he had asked me out specifically for the purpose of talking to me about it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I learned that the situation had remained unchanged for all practical purposes since the time of his confession to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“What do you think?” he asked vaguely.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What he wished to know was how I regarded him, who had fallen so deeply in love.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He wanted my opinion of him as he was then.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt that this desire of his to find out what I thought of him was a sure indication that he was not altogether his usual self.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I want to emphasize here—though you may think me rather repetitious—that K was normally an independent-minded fellow, and what others thought of him worried him very little.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He had the courage and strength to do anything if he thought he was right.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I saw this trait in him only too clearly in his dealings with his foster parents.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"No wonder, then, that I thought his question in the park rather out of character.I asked him why he thought it necessary to seek my opinion.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In an unusually dejected tone, he said, “I have found I am a weak man, and I am ashamed.” Then he added, “You see, I am lost.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I have become a puzzle even to myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What else can I do, but ask you for your honest opinion?” “What do you mean,” I asked quickly, “by ‘lost’?” He said, “I mean that I can’t decide whether to take a step forward or to turn back.” Once more, I prodded him: “Tell me, can you really turn back if you want to?” Suddenly, he seemed lost for an answer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"All he said was: “I cannot bear this pain.” His expression, as he said this, was indeed tormented.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If Ojosan had not been involved, I would surely have spoken to him kindly, and have tried to ease his suffering.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He needed kind words, as dry land needs rain.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I believe I was born with a compassionate heart.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I was not my usual self then.I watched him carefully, as though he were my fencing opponent.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There was not one part of me that was not on guard.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did not relax for one single moment my eyes, or my heart, or my body.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
To say that K did not guard himself well would be an understatement.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In his innocence, he put himself completely at my mercy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was allowed to observe him in leisure, and to note carefully his most vulnerable points.I could think of only one thing, and that was K’s defenselessness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He was hovering uncertainly between the world of reality and the world of his ideals.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Now is the time, I thought, to destroy my opponent.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I waited no longer to make my thrust.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I turned to him with a solemn air.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"True, the solemnity was a part of my tactics, but it was certainly in keeping with the way I felt.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I was too tense to see anything comical or shameful in what I was doing.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said cruelly, “Anyone who has no spiritual aspirations is an idiot.” This was what K had said to me when we were traveling in Boshu.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I threw back at him the very words that he had once used to humiliate me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Even my tone of voice was the same as his had been when he made the remark.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I insist that I was not being vindictive.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I confess to you that what I was trying to do was far more cruel than mere revenge.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wanted to destroy whatever hope there might have been in his love for Ojosan.K was born in a Shinshu temple.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I remember that at secondary school, he was already showing signs of moving away from the doctrines of his family’s sect.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am quite aware of my ignorance concerning the various Buddhist doctrines.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But it was clear to me that at least in the matter of men’s relationship with women, K was in disagreement with Shinshu teachings.11 K had always been fond of the phrase, “concentration of mind.” When I first heard K mention it, I thought it likely that “concentration of mind” implied, among other things, “control of passions.” When I learned later that much more than this was implied, I was surprised.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was K’s belief that everything had to be sacrificed for the sake of “the true way.” Even love without bodily desire was to be avoided.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Pursuit of “the true way” necessitated not merely restraint of appetite, but total abstinence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K made all this clear to me when he was living alone and trying to support himself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was already in love with Ojosan by that time, and I used to argue with him whenever he brought up the subject of “the true way.” K would listen to me with a look of pity on his face.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Always, it was contempt that lay behind his pity: I found hardly any trace of friendly tolerance in it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In view of all that we had said to each other in the past, I knew that K would be much hurt by my remark.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had no intention of destroying his old beliefs.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I said what I did say in order to make him even more righteous than he had been before.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, it mattered little to me whether he really followed “the true way” or not; or whether he would ever reach heaven.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What I feared was the harm he might cause me if he decided to change his ways.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was simply self-interest that prompted my remark.I said again: “Anyone who has no spiritual aspirations is an idiot.” I watched K closely.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wanted to see how my words were affecting him.“An idiot .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.” he said at last.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Yes, I’m an idiot.”He stood still as he spoke, and stared at his feet.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was suddenly frightened that in desperation, K had decided to accept the fact that he was an idiot.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was as demoralized as a man who finds that his opponent, whom he has just knocked down, is about to spring up with a new weapon m his hand.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A moment later, however, I realized that K had indeed spoken in a hopeless tone of voice.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wanted to see his eyes, but he would not look my way.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Slowly, we began to walk again.I walked by K’s side, waiting for him to speak again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was waiting for another chance to hurt him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I lurked in the shadows, so that I might take him by surprise.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was not an ignorant man, and I was not without conscience.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Had a voice whispered into my ear, “You are a coward,” I might at that moment have returned to my normal self.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And had the voice been that of K, I would surely have blushed with shame.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But K was not the one to admonish me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was too honest, too simple, and altogether too righteous to see through me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was in no mood to admire his virtues, however.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Instead, I saw them only as weaknesses.After a while, K turned towards me, and addressed me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This time, it was I that stopped walking.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then K also stopped.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At last, I was able to look into his eyes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was taller than I, and so I had to look up at him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was like a wolf crouching before a lamb.“Let us not talk about it any more,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was strangely affected by the pain in his eyes and in his words.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For a moment, I did not know what to say.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then, in a more pleading tone, he said again: “Please, don’t talk about it.” My answer was cruel.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The wolf jumped at the lamb’s throat.“Well, so you don’t want me to talk about it!",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Tell me, who brought up the subject anyway?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I remember rightly, it was you.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, if you really want me to stop, I will.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But not talking about it isn’t going to solve the problem, is it?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Can you will yourself to stop thinking about it?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Are you prepared to do that?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What’s become of all those principles of yours that you were always talking about?”K seemed to shrivel before my eyes.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He seemed not half as tall as he once was.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As I have said before, he was a very stubborn fellow; but he was also too honest to ignore his own inconsistency when it was bluntly pointed out to him by another.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I saw the effect my words had had on him, and I was satisfied.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then he said suddenly: “Am I prepared .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"?” Before I could say anything, he added: “Why not?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I can will myself .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.” He seemed to be talking to himself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And the words sounded as though they were spoken in a dream.In silence, we started to walk towards the house in Koishikawa.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was not very cold that day, for there was little wind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was winter nevertheless, and the park looked bleak.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I turned my head once, and looked back at the row of cedars.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"They were brown, and looked as if the frost had eaten all the greenness out of them.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Over them stretched the grey sky.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The coldness of the scene seemed to bite into my spine.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Hurriedly, in the twilight, we walked over Hongo Hill.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was only after we had reached the bottom of the valley and started walking up the hill in Koishikawa that I began to feel warm under my overcoat.We hardly spoke to each other on our way home.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Perhaps this was because we were in such a hurry to get back.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At dinner, Okusan asked us, “Why were you so late?” I said that K had asked me to walk with him to Ueno.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan seemed surprised, and said, “But it’s so cold!” Ojosan asked, “Why Ueno?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Was there something in Ueno you wanted to see?” “No,” I said, “we were simply taking a walk.” K said even less that night than usual.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan spoke to him; Ojosan laughed at him; but he would not respond.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He gulped his food down and went back to his room, leaving us at the table.In those days, such phrases as “the age of awakening” and “the new life” had not yet come into fashion.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But you must not think that K’s inability to discard his old ways and begin his life anew was due to his lack of modern concepts.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You must understand that to K, his own past seemed too sacred a thing to be thrown away like an old suit of clothes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One might say that his past was his life, and to deny it would have meant that his life thus far had been without purpose.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That K was hesitant in love does not mean that his love was in any sense lukewarm.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was unable to move, despite the violence of his emotion.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And since the impact of his new emotion was not so great as to allow him to forget himself, he was forced to look back, and remind himself of what his past had meant.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And in doing so, he could not but continue along the path that he had so far followed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, he had the kind of stubbornness and forbearance that is unknown these days.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I think that thus far, I understood K’s reaction to his own predicament well enough.That evening, after our walk to Ueno, I felt unusually relieved.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I quickly got up from the table, and followed K into his room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I sat down by his desk, and began to chatter about some trivial matter.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He looked pained.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It is possible that my eyes betrayed the triumph that I was then feeling.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I know that there was a note of self-congratulation in my voice.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"A few minutes later, I withdrew my hands from the brazier, and returned to my room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For the first time in my life, I felt that in one matter at least, I was more than a match for K.I was soon fast asleep.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then suddenly, I was awakened by someone calling my name.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The door was open, and I saw K’s shadowy figure standing in the door-way.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The lamp was still burning in his room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The change from sleep to wakefulness had been too abrupt, and I lay for a moment or two in a daze, unable to speak.“Were you asleep?” K asked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K himself always went to bed late.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I addressed myself to the shadow: “Did you want something?” “No, not really,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I went to the bathroom a minute ago, and on my way back, I wondered whether you were still up or not.” The light was behind him, and so I could not see his face clearly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I could tell by the tone of his voice that he was unusually calm.K stepped back into his room and closed the door.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The room became dark once more.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I closed my eyes in the darkness, to return to my peaceful dreaming.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I fell asleep immediately.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The next morning, I thought about the incident, and began to wonder why K had behaved so strangely.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was half-inclined to believe that it was all a dream.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At breakfast, I asked K if he had indeed opened the door in the middle of the night and called me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Yes, I did,” he replied.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Why?” I asked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He would not answer my question.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then after a brief silence he asked unexpectedly: “Have you been sleeping well lately?” His question gave me an odd sensation.We left the house together, as our lectures were to begin at the same hour that day.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The previous night’s incident was still bothering me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I began questioning him again during our walk to the university.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But K would not answer me satisfactorily.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally I said, “Are you sure you weren’t intending to continue yesterday’s conversation?” He said, “Certainly not!” His short answer, I felt, was his way of reminding me that in the park the previous afternoon, he had said: “Let us not talk about it any more.” I then remembered how fiercely proud K was; and the words he had muttered began strangely to oppress me: “Am I prepared?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Why not?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.”I was well aware that K possessed a resolute nature.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I understood also why it was that in this affair only, K was unable to act decisively.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I soon realized that I did not know K as well as I had thought.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K’s conduct under stress was not as predictable, I learned, as it was under normal circumstances.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The more I thought over K’s last words in the park, the less clear their meaning seemed to become.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Perhaps, I thought uneasily, he is as confident as ever; perhaps he is “prepared” not to forswear his love for Ojosan, but to reject his past once and for all so as to be free from all doubt and suffering.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The realization that K’s words could be thus interpreted came as a shock to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The shock itself should have revealed to me my own foolishness in jumping to conclusions about K; and I should perhaps have asked myself, “But is it not possible that there is yet another meaning hidden behind his words?” Unfortunately, I was unable to see things clearly then: it is sad to think how blind I was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, I persuaded myself that it was K’s intention to submit to his love for Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I became convinced that K, in his usual determined manner, would now do all he could to win her.A voice whispered into my ear, “It is up to you to make the final move.” The voice gave me new courage.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I must act before K does, I thought, and without his knowledge.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I decided to talk to Okusan about her daughter when both K and Ojosan were out of the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Quietly, I waited for the right moment: two days passed, then three, but it did not come.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Always, when I was in the house, one of the two was there also.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I became very impatient.A week went by, and I decided I could not wait any longer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I could think of no better plan than to feign illness and stay at home all day.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan, then Ojosan, and finally K himself came into my room to get me out of bed: I gave noncommittal answers to their questions, and allowed them to go away with the impression that I was not feeling very well.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was about ten o’clock when I finally crawled out of bed.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Both K and Ojosan had gone out.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There was not a sound in the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan, when she saw me, said: “You can’t be feeling well.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Why don’t you stay in bed?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I’ll bring you something to eat,” I was feeling perfectly healthy of course, and I had no desire to go back to bed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I washed my face, and had my breakfast in the morning room as usual.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan sat on the other side of the long brazier, and waited on me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was a strange meal, being neither breakfast nor lunch; and during it, I remained silent, wondering uneasily how I should word my proposition.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I have no doubt that Okusan misconstrued my preoccupation as a sign of illness.When the meal was over, I lit a cigarette.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan was obliged to remain seated by the brazier: she could hardly leave the room before I did.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She called the maid, and had her take the tray.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For lack of anything better to do, Okusan poured water into the iron kettle, and then began polishing the brazier.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said: “Okusan, are you busy?” “No,” she said; then, “Why do you ask?” “Well,” I said, “there’s something I should like to talk to you about.” “Yes?” she said, watching me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan’s manner was so casual that I began to lose courage.Finally, after a minute or two of beating about the bush, I said: “Has K said anything to you lately?” Okusan seemed taken aback by my question.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“What do you mean?” she asked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Before I could answer her she said, “Did he say something to you?”I had no inclination to tell her what K had told me that day in my room, so I said, “No.” I was immediately ashamed of the lie.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To ease my conscience, I added: “What I want to say has nothing to do with K. He has not asked me to say anything to you on his behalf.” “Is that so?” she said, and waited.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There was nothing left for me to do but come to the point.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Okusan,” I blurted out, “I want to marry Ojosan.” She was not half as surprised as I had expected.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She seemed at a loss for an answer, nevertheless, and gazed at me in silence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had gone too far now to be intimidated by mere silence.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Please,” I said, “let me marry her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I want Ojosan very much.” Okusan, being older, was much calmer than I.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Mind you,” she said, “I am not saying no.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But this is all so sudden .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".” “I want to marry her soon,” I said quickly, and she began to laugh.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then she said seriously, “Have you thought about it carefully?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Are you sure?” I assured her in no uncertain terms that though my manner of proposing might have seemed hasty, I had had Ojosan in mind for a very long time.There were a few more questions and answers, but I forget what they were.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan was an easy person to talk to on such an occasion as this: there was nothing elusive about her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In this respect, she was more like a man than a woman.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“All right,” she said finally.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“You may have her.” Then she said in a more formal tone, “Of course, it is I who should be doing the asking.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Who am I to say, ‘you may have her’?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She is, as you know, a wretched, fatherless child.”I do not think that the entire conversation lasted more than fifteen minutes.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It remained simple and direct throughout.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan made no stipulations.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She said that there was no need to consult her relatives, though of course she would have to inform them of the decision.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She seemed also to take it for granted that her daughter would raise no objections.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had some misgivings here.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Despite my education, I must have been the more conventional of the two: I said, “I don’t care about the relatives, but don’t you think you should ask Ojosan first?” She assured me that there was no need for me to worry.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She had no intentions, she said, of forcing her daughter to marry anyone she did not like.I returned to my room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Surely, I thought a little uncomfortably, it can’t be as easy as all this!",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I found new relief, however, in the thought that my future had at last been settled.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the whole, I was satisfied.I went back to the morning room about noon, and asked Okusan when she intended to inform Ojosan of my proposal.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Does it really matter when I tell her?” she said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“The important thing is that I know about it, don’t you think?” I was somehow made to feel that I was being more of a woman than she was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was about to withdraw in embarrassment when she stopped me and said, “All right.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Since you seem to be in a hurry, I will tell her today if you like.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I’ll talk to her when she gets back from her lessons.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Will that do?” “Yes, thank you,” I said, and went back to my room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The thought of having to sit quietly at my desk while the two ladies whispered to each other in their room was unnerving.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I put on my cap, and went out.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I met Ojosan at the bottom of the hill.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She seemed surprised to see me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I took off my cap, and said: “So you’re back.” She said in a puzzled tone, “You have recovered?” “Oh yes,” I said, “I am quite well now—quite well.” I walked away hurriedly towards Suidobashi.From Sarugakucho I entered the main street of Jimbocho and turned in the direction of Ogawamachi.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was my custom to browse through the secondhand bookshops whenever I found myself in that area, but I was in no mood that day for musty books.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I thought ceaselessly of what was happening at the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought of Okusan and what she had said to me that morning, then tried to imagine the scene in the house after Ojosan’s return.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I walked on, not caring where my feet led me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My mind was filled with thoughts of the two ladies.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I would suddenly stop in the middle of the street, and think, “They must be talking about it at this moment”; or, “They will have finished their talk by now.”I crossed Mansei Bridge and walked up the slope past the Temple of Myojin.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then from Hongo Hill I went down to the valley of Koishikawa.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
During this long walk—my route had formed a rough circle cutting through three separate boroughs—I gave K very little thought.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Why, I do not know.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Is it not strange that I did not think about him?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I felt very tense that afternoon, it is true; but where was my conscience?I returned to the house.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As usual, I went into K’s room in order to get to mine.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was then that I felt guilty for the first time.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He was of course at his desk, reading.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And as always, he looked up at me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But this time, he did not give me his customary greeting—“Did you just get back?” Instead, he said: “Are you feeling better now?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Have you seen the doctor?” Suddenly, I wanted to kneel before him and beg his forgiveness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was a violent emotion that I felt then.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I think that had K and I been alone in some wilderness, I would have listened to the cry of my conscience.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But there were others in the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I soon overcame the impulse of my natural self to be true to K. I only wish I had been given another such opportunity to ask K’s forgiveness.I saw him again at dinner.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He sat quietly, deep in some melancholy thought.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There was not the slightest sign of suspicion in his eyes.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"How could there be, when he knew nothing of what had happened in his absence?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan, ignorant of the truth about us, seemed unusually happy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Only I knew everything.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I found difficulty in swallowing my food.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was like lead.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Ojosan, whose custom it was to eat with us, did not appear at the table that evening.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When Okusan called her, she answered from the next room: “Yes, I’m coming!” K became curious.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally, he asked Okusan: “What’s the matter with her?” Okusan threw a glance in my direction, and said: “She’s probably embarrassed.” This made K all the more curious.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Why is she embarrassed?” he wanted to know.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan merely smiled, and looked at me again.I had guessed, immediately upon sitting down at the table, the reason for Okusan’s pleased look.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The last thing I wanted her to do was explain the whole situation to K in my presence.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The thought that Okusan was wont to show little reserve in such matters gave me acute discomfort.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Fortunately, K became silent again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And Okusan, despite her unusually cheerful mood, did not reveal the secret after all.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sighing with relief, I returned to my room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I could not help worrying about my future relations with K. “What am I going to say to him?” I asked myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought of one excuse after another, but none satisfied me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Eventually, the mere thought of having to explain my conduct to K became distasteful to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was a cowardly soul.Two or three days passed.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Needless to say, I remained very apprehensive.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What made matters worse was the changed attitude of Okusan and Ojosan towards me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It acted as a constant and painful reminder of the fact that the least I could do was tell K the truth.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It added to my feeling of guilt.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, I was fearful lest Okusan, who had a directness of manner rarely found in women, should one evening decide to tell K the happy news when we were all gathered round the dinner table.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And I could not be sure that K would not begin to brood on Ojosan’s manner, which seemed to me to have conspicuously altered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was compelled to admit that K had to be informed of the new relationship between myself and the family.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Knowing the weakness of my own position, I thought it a terrible hardship to have to face K and tell him myself.In desperation, I began to toy with the idea of asking Okusan to tell K of our engagement.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"(She would speak to him when I was out of the house, of course.)",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"However, if Okusan were to tell him everything truthfully, my action would seem no less shameful than it would if I were to break the news to him myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It did not seem so much of a consolation, after all, that K should learn the truth about me indirectly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, Okusan was sure to demand an explanation from me, if I were to ask her to give K a conveniently false account of how her daughter and I had become engaged; and I would then have to expose my weakness not only to my future mother-in-law, but to the person that I loved.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In my naïve and earnest way, I believed that such an exposé would seriously affect the ladies’ future opinion of me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not bear the thought of losing even a fraction of my sweetheart’s trust in me before we were married.And so, despite my sincere desire to follow the path of honesty, I strayed away from it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was a fool; or, if you like, a scheming rogue.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Apart from myself, only heaven knew me for what I was.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Having once done a dishonest thing, I found that I could not redeem myself without telling everyone of my dishonesty.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wanted desperately to keep my shame a secret.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At the same time, I felt that I had to win back my self-respect.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finding myself in this dilemma, I stood still.It was five or six days later that Okusan suddenly asked me: “Have you told K about the engagement?” “Not yet,” I answered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Why not?” she demanded.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt my whole body stiffen.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said nothing.“No wonder he looked so odd when I told him,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Her words shocked me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I remember them clearly still.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She continued: “You ought to be ashamed of yourself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He is, after all, a very close friend, isn’t he?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You really mustn’t treat him so callously.”“What did K say?” I asked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Oh, nothing of great interest,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I pressed her to tell me in detail what K had said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan of course had no reason to hide anything from me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Saying that there was really nothing much to tell, she proceeded to describe K’s reaction to the news.It would seem that K received his final blow with great composure.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He must have been surprised, of course.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Is that so?” he had said simply when told of the engagement of Ojosan and myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan had then said: “Do say that you are pleased.” This time, apparently, he had looked at her and smiled: “Congratulations.” Just as he was leaving the morning room he had turned around and said: “When is the wedding?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I would like to give a present, but since I have no money, I am afraid I can’t.”As I sat before Okusan, listening to her words, I felt a stifling pain welling up in my heart.K, then, had known about it for over two days, though one would never have guessed this from his manner.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not but admire his calm, however superficial it may have been.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It seemed to me that he was much the worthier of the two of us.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I said to myself: “Through cunning, I have won.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But as a man, I have lost.” My sense of defeat then became so violent that it seemed to spin around in my head like a whirlpool.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And when I imagined how contemptuous K must be of me, I blushed with shame.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I wanted to go to K and apologize for what I had done, but my pride—my fear of humiliation—restrained me.I finally tired of my own inability to decide whether I would speak to K or remain silent.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was, I remember, on a Saturday night that I told myself: “Tomorrow, I will make up my mind one way or the other.” But that night, K killed himself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Even now, I cannot recall the scene without horror.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I do not know what strange forces were at work that night; for I, who had always slept with my feet pointing towards the west, decided that evening to arrange my bedding so that my feet would point towards the east.12 Some time in the night, I was awakened by a cold draught on my head.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As I opened my eyes, I saw that the door between K’s room and mine was ajar.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This time, however, I did not see K’s shadowy figure standing in the doorway.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Like a man who has been suddenly warned of some approaching disaster, I sat up and peered into K’s room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In the dim lamplight, I could see his bed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The counterpane had been flung back.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K sat with his back turned towards me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The upper part of his body was bent forward.“Hey!” I called.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He did not answer.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Hey!,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
What’s the matter?” His body did not move.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I stood up, and went as far as the doorway.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From there, I took a quick glance round the room in the half-light.I experienced almost the same sensation then as I did when K first told me of his love for Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I stood still, transfixed by the scene I beheld.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My eyes stared unbelievingly, as though they were made of glass.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But the initial shock was like a sudden gust of wind, and was gone in a moment.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My first thought was, “It’s too late!” It was then that the great shadow that would for ever darken the course of my life spread before my mind’s eye.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And from somewhere in the shadow a voice seemed to be whispering: “It’s too late .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It’s too late .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".” My whole body began to tremble.But even at such a moment, I could not forget my own welfare.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I noticed a letter lying on K’s desk.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I saw that it was addressed to me, as I had hoped.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Frantically, I tore open the envelope.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The purport of the letter was not in the least what I had expected.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had been afraid that in it, I would find many things that would cause me great pain.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I had feared that its contents would be of such a nature that should Okusan and Ojosan happen to see it, they would cease to regard me with respect.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I had quickly read it through, my first thought was: “I’m safe.” (I was thinking only of my reputation: at the time, what others thought of me seemed of great importance.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
)The letter was simply written.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K explained his suicide only in a very general way.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He had decided to die, he said, because there seemed no hope of his ever becoming the firm, resolute person that he had always wanted to be.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He thanked me for my many kindnesses in the past: and as a last favor to him, would I, he asked, take care of everything after his death?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He asked that I apologize to Okusan on his behalf for causing her so much trouble.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And he wanted me to notify his relatives of his death.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In this brief, businesslike letter, there was no mention of Ojosan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I soon realized that K had purposely avoided any reference to her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But what affected me most was his last sentence, which had perhaps been written as an afterthought: “Why did I wait so long to die?”With trembling hands I folded up the letter, and returned it to the envelope.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I deliberately put it back on the desk, where everybody could see it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then I looked around, and for the first time, I saw the blood on the wall.I held his head—almost in embrace—and lifted it a little.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I wanted to take just one look at his face in death.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I bent down towards the floor, and peered at his face from beneath.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I quickly withdrew my hands.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Not only had the sight filled me with sudden horror, but the head had felt inordinately heavy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I sat still for a while, looking at the cold ears that I had just touched, and the thick, close-cropped hair, which seemed to belong to someone alive.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt no desire to cry.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I felt only frightened.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The fear I experienced then was not caused merely by the proximity of a bloodstained body.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"What truly frightened me was my own destiny: it seemed to have been irrevocably shaped by this friend of mine, who now lay cold and lifeless before me.I could think of nothing better to do than return to my room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There, I began to pace restlessly up and down.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My mind commanded me to do this for a while, useless though it might be.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I must do something,” I said to myself: then, “But what can I do?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It’s too late.” It was impossible for me to sit still.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Like a caged bear, I had to be constantly on the move.I was tempted to go and wake Okusan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But, at the same time, I felt that it would be wrong to allow her to see the dreadful sight in the next room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was particularly anxious that Ojosan should not see it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I knew that she would be terribly shocked if she did.I lit the lamp in my room.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Time and again, I looked at my watch.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
How slowly its hands seemed to move that night!,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could not be sure exactly when it was that I had been awakened by the draught, but I knew that it had been close to dawn.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And so I paced up and down, waiting impatiently for the sun to rise.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, I almost believed that night had fallen for ever.It had been our custom to get up at seven, for many of our morning lectures began at eight.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The maid, therefore, had to get up at six.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was some time before that hour that I decided to wake her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On my way to her room, however, I was stopped by Okusan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“This is Sunday, you know,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She had heard me walking down the corridor.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Since you are already awake,” I said, “will you be good enough to come to my room?” She slipped on a coat over her nightgown, and followed me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As soon as I entered my room, I shut the door to K’s room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I then said to Okusan, almost in a whisper: “A terrible thing has happened.” “What do you mean?” she asked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I nodded towards the closed door, and said: “You must be calm.” She went pale.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Okusan,” I said, “K has killed himself.” She stood absolutely still, and stared at me in silence.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"All of a sudden I knelt down, and bowing my head low before her, I said: “Please forgive me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was all my fault.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Will you and Ojosan ever forgive me?” Until that moment, I had felt no inclination to say such things to Okusan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was only when I saw her staring at me that I had the sudden urge to kneel down and blurt out my apology.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Please take it that I was compelled to apologize to Okusan and Ojosan because I could no longer apologize to K himself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was forced by my conscience to apologize against my will.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Fortunately for me, Okusan did not know the real reason why I had asked her forgiveness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Her face still pale, she said gently: “You mustn’t blame yourself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Who could have foreseen such a thing?” Despite her gentleness, however, I could see unmistakable signs of fear and shock in her eyes.Though I felt sorry for Okusan, I opened the door that I had only recently closed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K’s lamp had gone out, and the room was almost pitch dark.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I returned to my room and picked up my lamp.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I reached the doorway once more, I turned around and looked at Okusan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She walked slowly towards me, and peered fearfully over my shoulder into the small room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But she would not go in.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“You must open the storm windows,” she said, “and let the light in.”Okusan’s conduct throughout that day was exemplary, as one would expect of a soldier’s wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was in obedience to Okusan’s orders that I went to the doctor and then to the police.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"And until they had come and gone, she would not allow anyone to enter K’s room.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"K had cut open a carotid artery with a small knife, and had died instantly.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He had no other wound.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I learned that the blood which I had seen on the wall in the semi-darkness—as though in a dream—had gushed out in one tremendous spurt.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I looked at the stains again, this time in daylight; and I marveled at the power of human blood.Okusan and I cleaned up the room as well as we could.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Fortunately, most of the blood had been absorbed by the quilted bedding, and very little had touched the floor mats.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We moved K’s body to my room, and laid it out in a sleeping position.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I then went out to send a telegram to his family.When I returned, I found incense sticks already burning by his pillow.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Their scent, so reminiscent of death, filled the air.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The two ladies were sitting in the haze.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had not seen Ojosan since the previous evening.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She was crying.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Okusan must have been crying too, for her eyes were red-rimmed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I, who had not remembered to shed one tear since K’s death, was able to feel sorrow then for the first time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You have no idea what comfort this gave me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My heart, which until then had felt tight with pain and fear, seemed to find relief in sorrow.Silently, I sat down beside the two ladies.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Offer an incense stick,” said Okusan.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I obeyed her in silence.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Ojosan did not speak to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She exchanged a few words with her mother, but only concerning pressing business.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She could not bring herself to talk of K as she remembered him.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was glad that she had not witnessed the terrible scene immediately after his death.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was afraid that a beautiful person such as she could not behold anything ugly and frightful without somehow losing her beauty.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Even when the fear within me became so strong that it seemed to touch the very roots of my hair, I refused to move, not daring to expose her beauty to ugliness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought that to help destroy such beauty would be no less cruel and meaningless than to beat down a pretty, innocent flower.When K’s father and elder brother arrived, I gave my opinion as to where he should be buried.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K and I had often walked to Zoshigaya.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
K was very fond of the place.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I remembered saying to him jokingly: “All right, I’ll see to it that you’re buried here.” I thought to myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“What good will it do now to remember my promise to K?” But I wanted K to be buried in Zoshigaya, so that I could visit his grave every month and ask his forgiveness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
His father and brother raised no objections.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I suppose they felt that I had the right to decide where his grave should be, since I, and not they, had looked after K before his death.On our way back from the funeral, a friend of ours asked me: “Why did he commit suicide?” I had been asked the same painful question many times before—by Okusan and Ojosan, by his father and brother, by acquaintances who had been notified of his death, and even by newspaper reporters, who had never known him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My conscience pricked me each time I was asked the question.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It seemed that the question was in reality an accusation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It seemed that what the questioner meant to say was: “Why not be truthful, and admit that you killed him?”My answer was always the same.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I merely repeated what K had said in his last letter to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My friend, who had asked me the question after the funeral, produced a newspaper from his pocket when I had given him the usual answer.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
He pointed to the report of K’s death.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It explained that he had been disowned by his family, and in a fit of depression had killed himself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I folded the paper and handed it back to my friend.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He then told me that in another newspaper, K’s suicide had been attributed to insanity.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"All this I did not know, for I had been too busy to read the papers.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I had nevertheless been wondering what they were saying about K’s death.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was afraid that they might say something that would embarrass the two ladies.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The mere thought of Ojosan’s name being mentioned in connection with the affair upset me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“What else did you see in the papers?” I asked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Oh, nothing else,” he answered.It was not long after the funeral that the three of us moved into the house where I now live.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Both Okusan and Ojosan disliked the idea of staying in the old house, and I could not bear to be constantly reminded of that night.About two months later, I was able to graduate from the university.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Half a year after that, Ojosan and I were married at last.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"On the surface at least, I suppose it was a happy occasion.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After all, my hopes had been realized.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Okusan and Ojosan both appeared happy.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I will admit that I was too.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But over my happiness, there loomed a black shadow.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It seemed that my momentary contentment led nowhere, except to a sorrowful future.Soon after the wedding, Ojosan—“my wife,” I shall call her from now on—for some reason suggested that we visit K’s grave together.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I should have known better, but I was at once suspicious.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Why this sudden desire to go there?” I asked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“I thought that K would be pleased,” she said.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I gazed at her innocent face in silence.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I pulled myself together when she said, “Why do you look at me like that?”I complied with my wife’s request, and we went to Zoshigaya.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I washed the dust off the tombstone with water.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My wife put some flowers and incense sticks before it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We then bowed our heads in silent prayer.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My wife was probably telling K of her new happiness.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
All I could think of to say was: “I was wrong .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was wrong .,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
".”Touching the stone gently, my wife said: “This is a fine grave.” It was really not so impressive, but I suppose she praised it because I myself had chosen it at the stonemason’s.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought of the new stone, of my new wife, and of the newly buried white bones beneath us, and I felt that fate had made sport of us all.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“Never again,” I promised myself, “will I come here with my wife.”I did not cease to blame myself for K’s death.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From the beginning, I was afraid of the suffering my own sense of guilt would bring me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One might say that I went through my marriage ceremony, which I had looked forward to for so long, in a state of nervous insecurity.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But since I did not know my own self very well, I had a vague hope that perhaps marriage would enable me to begin a new life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"That this hope was no more than a fleeting daydream, I realized soon enough.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was my wife who unwittingly reminded me of harsh reality every time we were together.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"How could I continue to have hope, no matter how forlorn, when the sight of her face seemed always to bring back haunting memories of K?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, the idea occurred to me that she was like a chain that linked me to K for the rest of my life.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At such times, I would behave coldly to my wife, whom I found otherwise faultless.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She would immediately sense my aloofness and ask: “What are you thinking about?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Have I done something wrong?” There were times when I managed to ease her mind with a smile.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But there were times when she would show signs of irritation and say: “Are you sure you don’t dislike me?” or “You are hiding something from me.” And I would look at her in misery, not knowing what to say.Often, I was on the verge of telling her everything: but each time, at the crucial moment, I would be stopped by something that was beyond my conscious control.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You know me well, and I suppose there is no need for me to explain what this was that prevented me from confessing to my wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Nevertheless, I feel that I owe you an explanation.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Please understand that I did not wish my wife to believe me better than I actually was.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I am sure that if I had spoken to her with a truly repentant heart—as I did always to the spirit of my dead friend—she would have forgiven me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She would have cried, I know, from happiness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
That I refused to tell her the truth was not due to selfish calculation on my part.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I simply did not wish to taint her whole life with the memory of something that was ugly.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought that it would be an unforgivable crime to let fall even the tiniest drop of ink on a pure, spotless thing.A whole year passed, but my heart remained restless.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I tried to bury this restlessness in books.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I began to study furiously, and waited for the day when I would make public the result of my efforts.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But I found little comfort in striving towards a goal which I had artificially set myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Eventually, I found that I could not find peace in books.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once more I sat still, and gazed at the world around me.It would seem that my wife attributed my ennui to the fact that I had no material worries.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"This was understandable, since not only did my mother-in-law have enough money to support herself and her daughter, but there was enough on my side to enable me to live without working.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Besides, there is no doubt that I had learned to take my easy circumstances for granted.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But material comfort was by no means responsible for my inaction.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When I was cheated by my uncle, I felt very strongly the unreliableness of men.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I learned to judge others harshly, but not myself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I thought that in the midst of a corrupt world, I had managed to remain virtuous.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Because of K, however, my self-confidence was shattered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"With a shock, I realized that I was no better than my uncle.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I became as disgusted with myself as I had been with the rest of the world.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Action of any kind became impossible for me.Having failed to bury myself alive among books, I tried for a while to forget myself by drowning my soul in saké.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I do not say that I liked drinking.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I can drink if I want to, and I hoped that saké would bring at least momentary oblivion.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was being naïve, of course.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
All that drinking did for me in time was to make me more depressed than ever.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Occasionally, in the midst of a drunken stupor, I would suddenly remember myself: I would realize how idiotic it was to try to deceive oneself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then my eyes and my heart would be jerked back to sobriety.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, I would fail even to reach that stage of self-deception, and find myself becoming more keenly aware of my own sorrow.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Moreover, when I did succeed in reaching a state of artificially induced gaiety, I would be sure to sink into deep gloom afterwards.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was always in the latter state that my mother-in-law and my wife, whom I loved so much, found me after I had been drinking.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The way in which they interpreted my behavior was, under the circumstances, quite understandable.It would seem that my mother-in-law sometimes complained about me to my wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My wife never told me what her mother had said.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But she reproached me on her own account.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I suppose she could not bear to watch me live as I did without saying something.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I say that she “reproached” me, but I assure you that she never used strong words.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She hardly ever gave me cause to be angry with her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She asked me more than once if she was not in some way responsible for my behavior; she wanted to be told what her faults were.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Sometimes, she begged me to stop drinking for the sake of my own future.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once, she cried and said: “You have changed.” The words that followed hurt much more: “You would not have changed so, had K-san been alive.” “Perhaps you are right,” I answered.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Secretly, I grieved for my wife, who did not know how right she had been.Sometimes—usually the morning after I had come home late in a very drunken state—I would apologize to her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"She would listen to my apology, and then laugh; or she would remain silent; or she would begin to cry.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whatever she did, I was invariably disgusted with myself at such times.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I suppose that, in a sense, I was apologizing as much to myself as to her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally, I gave up drinking: one might say that it was self-disgust, rather than my wife’s reproaches, that made me stop.I did not touch saké any more, it is true, but I was at a loss as to what I should do instead.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In desperation, I began to read again.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I read with no object in view, however.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I would finish a book, then cast it aside, and open another.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My wife asked me, on more than one occasion, why it was that I studied so hard.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was saddened by the thought that she, whom I loved and trusted more than anyone else in the world, could not understand me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And the thought that I had not the courage to explain myself to her made me sadder still.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was very lonely.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, there were times when I felt that I stood completely alone in this world, cut off from every other living person.Time and again, I wondered what had caused K to commit suicide.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At first, I was inclined to think that it was disappointment in love.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could think of nothing but love then, and quite naturally, I accepted without question the first simple and straightforward explanation that came to my mind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Later, however, when I could think more objectively, I began to wonder whether my explanation had not been too simple.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I asked myself, “Was it perhaps because his ideals clashed with reality that he killed himself?” But I could not convince myself that K had chosen death for such a reason.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally, I became aware of the possibility that K had experienced loneliness as terrible as mine, and wishing to escape quickly from it, had killed himself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Once more, fear gripped my heart.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"From then on, like a gust of winter wind, the premonition that I was treading the same path as K had done would rush at me from time to time, and chill me to the bone.Then my mother-in-law fell ill.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The doctor told us she would not recover.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I devoted all my energy to caring for her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I did so for the invalid’s sake, and for my dear wife’s too; but I felt also that I was in some way helping the whole of mankind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There is no doubt that in a sense, I had been waiting for such a chance to prove to myself that I was not totally useless.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"For the first time since my retirement from the world, I was able to feel that I could still be of some use to others.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"There is no way to explain my state of mind, except to say that I was seeking a means of atoning for the wrong I had done.My mother-in-law died.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There remained only my wife and myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My wife said to me: “In all the world, I now have only you to turn to.” I looked at her, and my eyes suddenly filled with tears.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"How could I, who had no trust in myself, give her the comfort she needed?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I thought her a very unfortunate woman.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"One day, I said so to her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
“Why do you say that?” she asked.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She could not understand what I meant.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
And I could not tell her.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She began to cry.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"“It is because you have always looked at me in your twisted way,” she said reproachfully, “that you can say such things.”After her mother’s death, I tried to treat my wife as gently as I could.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I loved her, of course.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But again, I was not being gentle merely for her sake.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I suppose that my heart was moved in the same way as when my mother-in-law had fallen ill. My wife appeared content.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But in her contentment, there seemed to linger a vague uneasiness that sprang from her own inability to understand me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Mind you, I do not think for a moment that her uneasiness would have decreased had she been allowed to understand the nature of my gentleness towards her.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Indeed, I think that she would have become even more uneasy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
A woman is more happy when she is the sole object of affection—whether or not this kindness may involve injustice elsewhere does not seem to matter very much—than when she is loved for reasons which transcend particular individuals.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At least, I have noticed this tendency more in women than in men.My wife once asked me: “Can’t a man’s heart and a woman’s heart ever become a part of each other, so that they are one?” I gave a noncommittal answer: “Perhaps, when the man and the woman are young.” She sat quietly for a while.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She was probably thinking of the time when she herself had been a young girl.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then she gave a little sigh.From then on, a nameless fear would assail me from time to time.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At first, it seemed to come over me without warning from the shadows around me, and I would gasp at its unexpectedness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Later, however, when the experience had become more familiar to me, my heart would readily succumb—or perhaps respond—to it; and I would begin to wonder if this fear had not always been in some hidden corner of my heart, ever since I was born.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I would then ask myself whether I had not lost my sanity.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But I had no desire to go to a doctor, or anyone else, for advice.I felt very strongly the sinfulness of man.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"It was this feeling that sent me to K’s grave every month, that made me take care of my mother-in-law in her illness and behave gently towards my wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It was this sense of sin that led me to feel sometimes that I would welcome a flogging even at the hands of strangers.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When this desire for punishment became particularly strong, I would begin to feel that it should come from myself and not others.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Then I would think of death.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Killing myself seemed a just punishment for my sins.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Finally, I decided to go on living as if I were dead.I wonder how many years have passed since I made that decision.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My wife and I continued to live in harmony.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
We were by no means unhappy.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"We were, I assure you, quite a happy couple.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But there was always this shadow which separated us.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I could never push it away, and it lay like a dark streak across my wife’s happiness.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She has always sensed its presence.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As I think about it now, I cannot but feel terribly sorry for her.Though I had resolved to live as if I were dead, my heart would at times respond to the activity of the outside world, and seem almost to dance with pent-up energy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But as soon as I tried to break my way through the cloud that surrounded me, a frighteningly powerful force would rush upon me from I know not where, and grip my heart tight, until I could not move.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
A voice would say to me: “You have no right to do anything.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Stay where you are.” Whatever desire I might have had for action would suddenly leave me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"After a moment, the desire would come back, and I would once more try to break through.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Again, I would be restrained.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"In fury and grief, I would cry out: “Why do you stop me?” With a cruel laugh, the voice would answer: “You know very well why.” Then I would bow in hopeless surrender.Please understand that though I might have seemed to you to be leading an uncomplicated, humdrum life, there was a painful and unending struggle going on inside me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My wife must have felt very impatient with me sometimes: but you have no idea how much more impatient I was with myself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"When at last it became clear to me that I could not remain still in the prison much longer, and that I could not escape from it, I was forced to the conclusion that the easiest thing I could do would be to commit suicide.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
You may wonder why I reached such a conclusion.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But you see, that strange and terrible force which gripped my heart whenever I wished to make my escape in life, seemed at least to leave me free to find escape in death.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If I wished to move at all, then I could move only towards my own end.I tried two or three times to follow this only course which destiny had left open to me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"But each time, I was restrained by my feelings for my wife.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Needless to say, I lacked the courage to take her with me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"As you know, I could not even bring myself to confess everything to her: how could I, then, rob her of her allotted life and force her to share my own destiny?",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
The mere thought of doing such a cruel thing was terrible to me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Her fate had been pre-ordained no less than mine had been.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To throw her into the fire that had been built for me would be an extremely unnatural and piteous thing to do.At the same time, the thought of my wife living alone after I had gone aroused my compassion.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"How could I ever forget my wife’s words after her mother had died?—“In all the world, I now have only you to turn to.” And so I hesitated.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Afterwards, I would look at my wife and say to myself: “It’s a good thing that I hesitated.” And I would once more begin to live in hopelessness and frustration, feeling my wife’s disappointed eyes on me.Look back on those days when you knew me: my life then was as I have just described it.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My state of mind was always the same—at Kamakura where we met, or in the suburbs where we walked.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
A dark shadow seemed always to be following me.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I was no more than bearing the weight of life for her sake.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My mood was no different that night after your graduation.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Believe me, I was not lying when I said that we would meet again in September.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I really did mean to see you—even after the passing of autumn, even after winter had come and gone.Then at the height of the summer, Emperor Meiji passed away.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I felt as though the spirit of the Meiji era had begun with the Emperor, and had ended with him.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I was overcome with the feeling that I and the others, who had been brought up in that era, were now left behind to live as anachronisms.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I told my wife so.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
She laughed and refused to take me seriously.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Then she said a curious thing, albeit in jest: “Well then, junshi13 is the solution to your problem.”I had almost forgotten that there was such a word as “junshi.” It is not a word that one uses normally, and I suppose it had been banished to some remote corner of my memory.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I turned to my wife, who had reminded me of its existence, and said: “I will commit junshi if you like; but in my case, it will be through loyalty to the spirit of the Meiji era.” My remark was meant as a joke; but I did feel that the antiquated word had come to hold a new meaning for me.A month passed.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
On the night of the Imperial Funeral I sat in my study and listened to the booming of the cannon.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"To me, it sounded like the last lament for the passing of an age.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Later, I realized that it might also have been a salute to General Nogi.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Holding the extra edition in my hand, I blurted out to my wife: “Junshi!",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Junshi!”I read in the paper the words General Nogi had written before killing himself.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I learned that ever since the Seinan War,14 when he lost his banner to the enemy, he had been wanting to redeem his honor through death.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I found myself automatically counting the years that the general had lived, always with death at the back of his mind.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The Seinan War, as you know, took place in the tenth year of Meiji.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"He must therefore have lived for thirty-five years, waiting for the proper time to die.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I asked myself: “When did he suffer greater agony—during those thirty-five years, or the moment when the sword entered his bowels?”It was two or three days later that I decided at last to commit suicide.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Perhaps you will not understand clearly why I am about to die, no more than I can fully understand why General Nogi killed himself.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"You and I belong to different eras, and so we think differently.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There is nothing we can do to bridge the gap between us.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Of course, it may be more correct to say that we are different simply because we are two separate human beings.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At any rate, I have done my best in the above narrative to make you understand this strange person that is myself.I am leaving my wife behind me.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
It is fortunate that she will have enough to live on after I am gone.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I have no wish to give her a greater shock than is necessary.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I intend to die in such a way that she will be spared the sight of my blood.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I shall leave this world quietly while she is out of the house.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"I want her to think that I died suddenly, without reason.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Perhaps she will think that I lost my mind: that will be all right.More than ten days have gone by since I decided to die.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I want you to know that I spent most of the time writing this epistle about myself to you.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"At first, I wanted to speak to you about my life; but now that I have almost finished writing this, I feel that I could not have given as clear an account verbally, and I am happy.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Please understand, I did not write this merely to pass the time away.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"My own past, which made me what I am, is a part of human experience.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Only I can tell it.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I do not think that my effort to do so honestly has been entirely purposeless.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"If my story helps you and others to understand even a part of what we are, I shall be satisfied.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Only recently, I was told that Watanabe Kazan postponed his death for a week in order to complete his painting, Kantan.15 Some may say that this was a vain sort of thing to do.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But who are we to judge the needs of another man’s heart?,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I did not write simply to keep my promise to you.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
More compelling than the promise was the necessity which I felt within me to write this story.I have now satisfied that need.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
There is nothing left for me to do.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"By the time this letter reaches you, I shall probably have left this world—I shall in all likelihood be dead.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"About ten days ago, my wife went to stay with her aunt in Ichigaya.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"The aunt fell ill, and when I heard that she was short of help, I sent my wife there.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
Most of this long document was written while she was away.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"Whenever she returned, I quickly hid it from her.I want both the good and bad things in my past to serve as an example to others.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
But my wife is the one exception—I do not want her to know about any of this.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
My first wish is that her memory of me should be kept as unsullied as possible.,Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
"So long as my wife is alive, I want you to keep everything I have told you a secret—even after I myself am dead.",Natsume Soseki,Kokoro
I AM A CAT.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
As yet I have no name.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve no idea where I was born.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All I remember is that I was miaowing in a dampish dark place when, for the first time, I saw a human being.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This human being, I heard afterwards, was a member of the most ferocious human species; a shosei, one of those students who, in return for board and lodging, perform small chores about the house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I hear that, on occasion, this species catches, boils, and eats us.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However as at that time I lacked all knowledge of such creatures, I did not feel particularly frightened.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I simply felt myself floating in the air as I was lifted up lightly on his palm.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I accustomed myself to that position, I looked at his face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This must have been the very first time that ever I set eyes on a human being.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The impression of oddity, which I then received, still remains today.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First of all, the face that should be decorated with hair is as bald as a kettle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Since that day I have met many a cat but never have I come across such deformity.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The center of the face protrudes excessively and sometimes, from the holes in that protuberance, smoke comes out in little puffs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was originally somewhat troubled by such exhalations for they made me choke, but I learnt only recently that it was the smoke of burnt tobacco which humans like to breathe.For a little while I sat comfortably in that creature’s palm, but things soon developed at a tremendous speed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I could not tell whether the shosei was in movement or whether it was only I that moved; but anyway I began to grow quite giddy, to feel sick.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And just as I was thinking that the giddiness would kill me, I heard a thud and saw a million stars.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus far I can remember but, however hard I try, I cannot recollect anything thereafter.When I came to myself, the creature had gone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I had at one time had a basketful of brothers, but now not one could be seen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even my precious mother had disappeared.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Moreover I now found myself in a painfully bright place most unlike that nook where once I’d sheltered.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was in fact so bright that I could hardly keep my eyes open.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sure that there was something wrong, I began to crawl about.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which proved painful.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I had been snatched away from softest straw only to be pitched with violence into a prickly clump of bamboo grass.After a struggle, I managed to scramble clear of the clump and emerged to find a wide pond stretching beyond it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I sat at the edge of the pond and wondered what to do.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No helpful thought occurred.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After a while it struck me that, if I cried, perhaps the shosei might come back to fetch me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I tried some feeble mewing, but no one came.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Soon a light wind blew across the pond and it began to grow dark.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I felt extremely hungry.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I wanted to cry, but I was too weak to do so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There was nothing to be done.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, having decided that I simply must find food, I turned, very, very slowly, left around the pond.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was extremely painful going.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, I persevered and crawled on somehow until at long last I reached a place where my nose picked up some trace of human presence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I slipped into a property through a gap in a broken bamboo fence, thinking that something might turn up once I got inside.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was sheer chance; if the bamboo fence had not been broken just at that point, I might have starved to death at the roadside.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I realize now how true the adage is that what is to be will be.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To this very day that gap has served as my shortcut to the neighbor’s tortoiseshell.Well, though I had managed to creep into the property, I had no idea what to do next.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Soon it got really dark.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was hungry, it was cold and rain began to fall.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I could not afford to lose any more time.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I had no choice but to struggle toward a place which seemed, since brighter, warmer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I did not know it then, but I was in fact already inside the house where I now had a chance to observe further specimens of humankind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The first one that I met was O-san, the servant-woman, one of a species yet more savage than the shosei.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No sooner had she seen me than she grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and flung me out of the house.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accepting that I had no hope, I lay stone-still, my eyes shut tight and trusting to Providence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the hunger and the cold were more than I could bear.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Seizing a moment when O-san had relaxed her watch, I crawled up once again to flop into the kitchen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was soon flung out again.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I crawled up yet again, only to be flung out yet again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I remember that the process was several times repeated.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ever since that time, I have been utterly disgusted with this O-san person.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The other day I managed at long last to rid myself of my sense of grievance, for I squared accounts by stealing her dinner of mackerel-pike.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I was about to be flung out for the last time, the master of the house appeared, complaining of the noise and demanding an explanation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The servant lifted me up, turned my face to the master and said, “This little stray kitten is being a nuisance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I keep putting it out and it keeps crawling back into the kitchen.” The master briefly studied my face, twisting the black hairs under his nostrils.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, “In that case, let it stay,” he said; and turned and went inside.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The master seemed to be a person of few words.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The servant resentfully threw me down in the kitchen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And it was thus that I came to make this house my dwelling.My master seldom comes face-to-face with me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I hear he is a schoolteacher.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As soon as he comes home from school, he shuts himself up in the study for the rest of the day; and he seldom emerges.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The others in the house think that he is terribly hard-working.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He himself pretends to be hard-working.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But actually he works less hard than any of them think.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sometimes I tiptoe to his study for a peep and find him taking a snooze.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Occasionally his mouth is drooling onto some book he has begun to read.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He has a weak stomach and his skin is of a pale yellowish color, inelastic and lacking in vitality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nevertheless he is an enormous gormandiser.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After eating a great deal, he takes some taka-diastase for his stomach and, after that, he opens a book.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he has read a few pages, he becomes sleepy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He drools onto the book.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This is the routine religiously observed each evening.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There are times when even I, a mere cat, can put two thoughts together.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Teachers have it easy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you are born a human, it’s best to become a teacher.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For if it’s possible to sleep this much and still to be a teacher, why, even a cat could teach.” However, according to the master, there’s nothing harder than a teacher’s life and every time his friends come round to see him, he grumbles on and on.During my early days in the house, I was terribly unpopular with everyone except the master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Everywhere I was unwelcome, and no one would have anything to do with me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The fact that nobody, even to this day, has given me a name indicates quite clearly how very little they have thought about me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Resigned, I try to spend as much of my time as possible with the master, the man who had taken me in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the morning, while he reads the newspaper, I jump to curl up on his knees.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Throughout his afternoon siesta, I sit upon his back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This is not because I have any particular fondness for the master, but because I have no other choice; no one else to turn to.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Additionally, and in the light of other experiments, I have decided to sleep on the boiled-rice container, which stays warm through the morning, on the quilted foot-warmer during the evening, and out on the veranda when it is fine.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But what I find especially agreeable is to creep into the children’s bed and snuggle down between them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There are two children, one of five and one of three: they sleep in their own room, sharing a bed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I can always find a space between their bodies, and I manage somehow to squeeze myself quietly in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if, by great ill-luck, one of the children wakes, then I am in trouble.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For the children have nasty natures, especially the younger one.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They start to cry out noisily, regardless of the time, even in the middle of the night, shouting, “Here’s the cat!”Then invariably the neurotic dyspeptic in the next room wakes and comes rushing in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why, only the other day, my master beat my backside black and blue with a wooden ruler.Living as I do with human beings, the more that I observe them, the more I am forced to conclude that they are selfish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Especially those children.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I find my bedmates utterly unspeakable.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When the fancy takes them, they hang me upside-down, they stuff my face into a paper-bag, they fling me about, they ram me into the kitchen range.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Furthermore, if I do commit so much as the smallest mischief, the entire household unites to chase me around and persecute me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The other day when I happened to be sharpening my claws on some straw floor-matting, the mistress of the house became so unreasonably incensed that now it is only with the greatest reluctance that she’ll even let me enter a matted room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though I’m shivering on the wooden floor in the kitchen, heartlessly she remains indifferent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Miss Blanche, the white cat who lives opposite and whom I much admire, tells me whenever I see her that there is no living creature quite so heartless as a human.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The other day, she gave birth to four beautiful kittens.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But three days later, the shosei of her house removed all four and tossed them away into the backyard pond.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Miss Blanche, having given through her tears a complete account of this event, assured me that, to maintain our own parental love and to enjoy our beautiful family life, we, the cat-race, must engage in total war upon all humans.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We have no choice but to exterminate them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I think it is a very reasonable proposition.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And the three-colored tomcat living next door is especially indignant that human beings do not understand the nature of proprietary rights.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Among our kind it is taken for granted that he who first finds something, be it the head of a dried sardine or a gray mullet’s navel, acquires thereby the right to eat it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And if this rule be flouted, one may well resort to violence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But human beings do not seem to understand the rights of property.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every time we come on something good to eat, invariably they descend and take it from us.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Relying on their naked strength, they coolly rob us of things which are rightly ours to eat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Miss Blanche lives in the house of a military man, and the tomcat’s master is a lawyer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But since I live in a teacher’s house, I take matters of this sort rather more lightly than they.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel that life is not unreasonable so long as one can scrape along from day to day.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For surely even human beings will not flourish forever.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I think it best to wait in patience for the Day of the Cats.Talking of selfishness reminds me that my master once made a fool of himself by reason of this failing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ll tell you all about it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
First you must understand that this master of mine lacks the talent to be more than average at anything at all; but nonetheless he can’t refrain from trying his hand at everything and anything.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s always writing haiku and submitting them to Cuckoo; he sends off new-style poetry to Morning Star; he has a shot at English prose peppered with gross mistakes; he develops a passion for archery; he takes lessons in chanting No play-texts; and sometimes he devotes himself to making hideous noises with a violin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But I am sorry to say that none of these activities has led to anything whatsoever.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet, though he is dyspeptic, he gets terribly keen once he has embarked upon a project.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He once got himself nicknamed “The Maestro of the Water-closet” through chanting in the lavatory, but he remains entirely unconcerned and can still be heard there chanting “I am Taira-no-Munemori.” We all say, “There goes Munemori,” and titter at his antics.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I do not know why it happened, but one fine day (a payday roughly four weeks after I’d taken up residence) this master of mine came hurrying home with a large parcel under his arm.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wondered what he’d bought.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It turned out that he’d purchased watercolor paints, brushes, and some special “Whatman” paper.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It looked to me as if haiku-writing, and mediaeval chanting were going to be abandoned in favor of watercolor painting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sure enough, from the next day on and every day for some long time, he did nothing but paint pictures in his study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He even went without his afternoon siestas.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, no one could tell what he had painted by looking at the result.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Possibly he himself thought little of his work; for, one day when his friend who specializes in matters of aesthetics came to visit him, I heard the following conversation.“Do you know it’s quite difficult?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When one sees someone else painting, it looks easy enough; but not till one takes a brush oneself, does one realize just how difficult it is.” So said my noble master, and it was true enough.His friend, looking at my master over his gold-rimmed spectacles, observed, “It’s only natural that one cannot paint particularly well the moment one starts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Besides, one cannot paint a picture indoors by force of the imagination only.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The Italian Master, Andrea del Sarto, remarked that if you want to paint a picture, always depict nature as she is.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the sky, there are stars.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On earth, there are sparkling dews.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Birds are flying.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Animals are running.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In a pond there are goldfish.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
On an old tree one sees winter crows.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nature herself is one vast living picture.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
D’you understand?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you want to paint a picturesque picture, why not try some preliminary sketching?”“Oh, so Andrea del Sarto said that?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I didn’t know that at all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Come to think of it, it’s quite true.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, it’s very true.”The master was unduly impressed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I saw a mocking smile behind the gold-rimmed glasses.The next day when, as always, I was having a pleasant nap on the veranda, the master emerged from his study (an act unusual in itself) and began behind my back to busy himself with something.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At this point I happened to wake up and, wondering what he was up to, opened my eyes just one slit the tenth of an inch.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And there he was, fairly killing himself at being Andrea del Sarto.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I could not help but laugh.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s starting to sketch me just because he’s had his leg pulled by a friend.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have already slept enough, and I’m itching to yawn.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But seeing my master sketching away so earnestly, I hadn’t the heart to move: so I bore it all with resignation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having drawn my outline, he’s started painting the face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I confess that, considering cats as works of art, I’m far from being a collector’s piece.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I certainly do not think that my figure, my fur, or my features are superior to those of other cats.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But however ugly I may be, there’s no conceivable resemblance between myself and that queer thing which my master is creating.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First of all, the coloring is wrong.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My fur, like that of a Persian, bears tortoiseshell markings on a ground of a yellowish pale grey.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is a fact beyond all argument.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Yet the color which my master has employed is neither yellow nor black; neither grey nor brown; nor is it any mixture of those four distinctive colors.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All one can say is that the color used is a sort of color.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Furthermore, and very oddly, my face lacks eyes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The lack might be excused on the grounds that the sketch is a sketch of a sleeping cat; but, all the same, since one cannot find even a hint of an eye’s location, it is not all clear whether the sketch is of a sleeping cat or of a blind cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Secretly I thought to myself that this would never do, even for Andrea del Sarto.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, I could not help being struck with admiration for my master’s grim determination.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Had it been solely up to me, I would gladly have maintained my pose for him, but Nature has now been calling for some time.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The muscles in my body are getting pins and needles.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When the tingling reached a point where I couldn’t stand it another minute, I was obliged to claim my liberty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I stretched my front paws far out in front of me, pushed my neck out low and yawned cavernously.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having done all that, there’s no further point in trying to stay still.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master’s sketch is spoilt anyway, so I might as well pad round to the backyard and do my business.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Moved by these thoughts, I start to crawl sluggishly away.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Immediately, “You fool” came shouted in my master’s voice, a mixture of wrath and disappointment, out of the inner room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He has a fixed habit of saying, “You fool” whenever he curses anyone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He cannot help it since he knows no other swear words.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I thought it rather impertinent of him thus unjustifiably to call me “a fool.” After all, I had been very patient up to this point.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, had it been his custom to show even the smallest pleasure whenever I jump on his back, I would have tamely endured his imprecations: but it is a bit thick to be called “a fool” by someone who has never once with good grace done me a kindness just because I get up to go and urinate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The prime fact is that all humans are puffed up by their extreme self-satisfaction with their own brute power.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unless some creatures more powerful than humans arrive on earth to bully them, there’s just no knowing to what dire lengths their fool presumptuousness will eventually carry them.One could put up with this degree of selfishness, but I once heard a report concerning the unworthiness of humans, which is several times more ugly and deplorable.At the back of my house there is a small tea-plantation, perhaps some six yards square.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though certainly not large, it is a neat and pleasantly sunny spot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is my custom to go there whenever my morale needs strengthening; when, for instance, the children are making so much noise that I cannot doze in peace, or when boredom has disrupted my digestion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One day, a day of Indian summer, at about two o’clock in the afternoon, I woke from a pleasant after-luncheon nap and strolled out to this tea-plantation by way of taking exercise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sniffing, one after another, at the roots of the tea plants, I came to the cypress fence at the western end; and there I saw an enormous cat fast asleep on a bed of withered chrysanthemums, which his weight had flattened down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He did not seem to notice my approach.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps he noticed but did not care.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, there he was, stretched out at full length and snoring loudly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was amazed at the daring courage that permitted him, a trespasser, to sleep so unconcernedly in someone else’s garden.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He was a pure black cat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The sun of earliest afternoon was pouring its most brilliant rays upon him, and it seemed as if invisible flames were blazing out from his glossy fur.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He had a magnificent physique; the physique, one might say, of the Emperor of Catdom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He was easily twice my size.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Filled with admiration and curiosity, I quite forgot myself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I stood stock-still, entranced, all eyes in front of him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The quiet zephyrs of that Indian summer set gently nodding a branch of Sultan’s Parasol, which showed above the cypress fence, and a few leaves pattered down upon the couch of crushed chrysanthemums.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The Emperor suddenly opened his huge round eyes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I remember that moment to this day.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His eyes gleamed far more beautifully than that dull amber stuff which humans so inordinately value.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He lay dead still.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Focussing the piercing light that shone from his eyes’ interior upon my dwarfish forehead, he remarked, “And who the hell are you?”I thought his turn of phrase a shade inelegant for an Emperor, but because the voice was deep and filled with a power that could suppress a bulldog.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I remained dumb-struck with pure awe.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Reflecting, however, that I might get into trouble if I failed to exchange civilities, I answered frigidly, with a false sang froid as cold as I could make it, “I, sir, am a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have as yet no name.” My heart at that moment was beating a great deal faster than usual.In a tone of enormous scorn, the Emperor observed, “You.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
a cat?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, I’m damned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, where the devil do you hang out?” I thought this cat excessively blunt-spoken.“I live here, in the teacher’s house.”“Huh, I thought as much.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"’Orrible scrawny aren’t you.” Like a true Emperor, he spoke with great vehemence.Judged by his manner of speech, he could not be a cat of respectable background.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the other hand, he seemed well fed and positively prosperous, almost obese, in his oily glossiness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I had to ask him “And you, who on earth are you?”“Me?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m Rickshaw Blacky.” He gave his answer with spirit and some pride: for Rickshaw Blacky is well-known in the neighborhood as a real rough customer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As one would expect of those brought up in a rickshaw-garage, he’s tough but quite uneducated.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hence very few of us mix with him, and it is our common policy to “keep him at a respectful distance.” Consequently when I heard his name, I felt a trifle jittery and uneasy but at the same time a little disdainful of him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, and in order to establish just how illiterate he was, I pursued the conversation by enquiring, “Which do you think is superior, a rickshaw-owner or a teacher?”“Why, a rickshaw-owner, of course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s the stronger.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just look at your master, almost skin and bones.”“You, being the cat of a rickshaw-owner, naturally look very tough.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I can see that one eats well at your establishment.”“Ah well, as far as I’m concerned, I never want for decent grub wherever I go.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You too, instead of creeping around in a tea-plantation, why not follow along with me?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Within a month, you’d get so fat nobody’d recognize you.”“In due course I might come and ask to join you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But it seems that the teacher’s house is larger than your boss’s.”“You dimwit!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A house, however big it is, won’t help fill an empty belly.” He looked quite huffed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Savagely twitching his ears, ears as sharp as slant-sliced stems of the solid bamboo, he took off rowdily.This was how I first made the acquaintance of Rickshaw Blacky, and since that day I’ve run across him many times.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whenever we meet he talks big, as might be expected from a rickshaw-owner’s cat; but that deplorable incident which I mentioned earlier was a tale he told me.One day Blacky and I were lying as usual, sunning ourselves in the tea-garden.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We were chatting about this and that when, having made his usual boasts as if they were all brandnew, he asked me, “How many rats have you caught so far?”While I flatter myself that my general knowledge is wider and deeper than Blacky’s, I readily admit that my physical strength and courage are nothing compared with his.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All the same, his point-blank question naturally left me feeling a bit confused.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, a fact’s a fact, and one should face the truth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So I answered “Actually, though I’m always thinking of catching one, I’ve never yet caught any.”Blacky laughed immoderately, quivering the long whiskers, which stuck out stiffly round his muzzle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Blacky, like all true braggarts, is somewhat weak in the head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As long as you purr and listen attentively, pretending to be impressed by his rhodomontade, he is a more or less manageable cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Soon after getting to know him, I learnt this way to handle him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently on this particular occasion I also thought it would be unwise to further weaken my position by trying to defend myself, and that it would be more prudent to dodge the issue by inducing him to brag about his own successes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So without making a fuss, I sought to lead him on by saying, “You, judging by your age, must have caught a notable number of rats?” Sure enough, he swallowed the bait with gusto.“Well, not too many, but I must’ve caught thirty or forty,” was his triumphant answer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I can cope,” he went on, “with a hundred or two hundred rats, any time and by myself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But a weasel, no.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That I just can’t take.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Once I had a hellish time with a weasel.”“Did you really?” I innocently offered.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Blacky blinked his saucer eyes but did not discontinue.“It was last year, the day for the general housecleaning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As my master was crawling in under the floorboards with a bag of lime, suddenly a great, dirty weasel came whizzing out.”“Really?” I make myself look impressed.“I say to myself, ‘So what’s a weasel?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Only a wee bit bigger than a rat.’ So I chase after it, feeling quite excited and finally I got it cornered in a ditch.”“That was well done,” I applaud him.“Not in the least.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
As a last resort it upped its tail and blew a filthy fart.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Ugh!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The smell of it!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since that time, whenever I see a weasel, I feel poorly.” At this point, he raised a front paw and stroked his muzzle two or three times as if he were still suffering from last year’s stench.I felt rather sorry for him and, in an effort to cheer him up, said, “But when it comes to rats, I expect you just pin them down with one hypnotic glare.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And I suppose that it’s because you’re such a marvelous ratter, a cat well nourished by plenty of rats, that you are so splendidly fat and have such a good complexion.” Though this speech was meant to flatter Blacky, strangely enough it had precisely the opposite effect.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He looked distinctly cast down and replied with a heavy sigh.“It’s depressing,” he said, “when you come to think of it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
However hard one slaves at catching rats.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In the whole wide world there’s no creature more brazen-faced than a human being.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every rat I catch they confiscate, and they tote them off to the nearest police-box.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since the copper can’t tell who caught the rats, he just pays up a penny a tail to anyone that brings them in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, for instance, has already earned about half a crown purely through my efforts, but he’s never yet stood me a decent meal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The plain fact is that humans, one and all, are merely thieves at heart.”Though Blacky’s far from bright, one cannot fault him in this conclusion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He begins to look extremely angry and the fur on his back stands up in bristles.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Somewhat disturbed by Blacky’s story and reactions, I made some vague excuse and went off home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But ever since then I’ve been determined never to catch a rat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, I did not take up Blacky’s invitation to become his associate in prowling after dainties other than rodents.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I prefer the cozy life, and it’s certainly easier to sleep than to hunt for titbits.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Living in a teacher’s house, it seems that even a cat acquires the character of teachers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d best watch out lest, one of these days, I, too, become dyspeptic.Talking of teachers reminds me that my master seems to have recently realized his total incapacity as a painter of watercolors; for under the date of December 1st his diary contains the following passage: At today’s gathering I met for the first time a man who shall be nameless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He is said to have led a fast life.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Indeed he looks very much a man of the world.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since women like this type of person, it might be more appropriate to say that he has been forced to lead, rather than that he has led, a fast life.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I hear his wife was originally a geisha.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He is to be envied.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For the most part, those who carp at rakes are those incapable of debauchery.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Further, many of those who fancy themselves as rakehells are equally incapable of debauchery.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such folk are under no obligation to live fast lives, but do so of their own volition.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So I in the matter of watercolors.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Neither of us will ever make the grade.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And yet this type of debauchee is calmly certain that only he is truly a man of the world.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If it is to be accepted that a man can become a man of the world by drinking saké in restaurants, or by frequenting houses of assignation, then it would seem to follow that I could acquire a name as a painter of watercolors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The notion that my watercolor pictures will be better if I don’t actually paint them leads me to conclude that a boorish country-bumpkin is in fact far superior to such foolish men of the world.His observations about men of the world strike me as somewhat unconvincing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In particular his confession of envy in respect of that wife who’d worked as a geisha is positively imbecile and unworthy of a teacher.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nevertheless his assessment of the value of his own watercolor painting is certainly just.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Indeed my master is a very good judge of his own character but still manages to retain his vanity.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Three days later, on December 4th, he wrote in his diary:Last night I dreamt that someone picked up one of my watercolor paintings which I, thinking it worthless, had tossed aside.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This person in my dream put the painting in a splendid frame and hung it up on a transom.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Staring at my work thus framed, I realized that I have suddenly become a true artist.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel exceedingly pleased.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I spend whole days just staring at my handiwork, happy in the conviction that the picture is a masterpiece.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Dawn broke and I woke up, and in the morning sunlight it was obvious that the picture was still as pitiful an object as when I painted it.The master, even in his dreams, seems burdened with regrets about his watercolors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And men who accept the burdens of regret, whether in respect of watercolors or of anything else, are not the stuff that men of the world are made of.The day after my master dreamt about the picture, the aesthete in the gold-rimmed spectacles paid a call upon him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He had not visited for some long time.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As soon as he was seated he inquired, “And how is the painting coming along?”My master assumed a nonchalant air and answered, “Well, I took your advice and I am now busily engaged in sketching.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And I must say that when one sketches one seems to apprehend those shapes of things, those delicate changes of color, which hitherto had gone unnoticed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I take it that sketching has developed in the West to its present remarkable condition solely as the result of the emphasis which, historically, has always there been placed upon the essentiality thereof.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Precisely as Andrea del Sarto once observed.” Without even so much as alluding to the passage in his diary, he speaks approvingly of Andrea del Sarto.The aesthete scratched his head, and remarked with a laugh, “Well actually that bit about del Sarto was my own invention.”“What was?” My master still fails to grasp that he’s been tricked into making a fool of himself.“Why, all that stuff about Andrea del Sarto whom you so particularly admire, I made it all up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I never thought you’d take it seriously.” He laughed and laughed, enraptured with the situation.I overheard their conversation from my place on the veranda and I could not help wondering what sort of entry would appear in the diary for today.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This aesthete is the sort of man whose sole pleasure lies in bamboozling people by conversation consisting entirely of humbug.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He seems not to have thought of the effect his twaddle about Andrea del Sarto must have on my master’s feelings, for he rattled on proudly, “Sometimes I cook up a little nonsense and people take it seriously, which generates an aesthetic sensation of extreme comicality which I find interesting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The other day, I told a certain undergraduate that Nicholas Nickleby had advised Gibbon to cease using French for the writing of his masterpiece, The History of the French Revolution, and had indeed persuaded Gibbon to publish it in English.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now this undergraduate was a man of almost eidetic memory, and it was especially amusing to hear him repeating what I told him, word for word and in all seriousness, to a debating session of the Japan Literary Society.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And d’you know, there were nearly a hundred in his audience, and all of them sat listening to his drivel with the greatest enthusiasm!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, I’ve another, even better, story.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The other day, when I was in the company of some men of letters, one of them happened to mention Theofano, Ainsworth’s historical novel of the Crusades.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I took the occasion to remark that it was a quite outstanding romantic monograph and added the comment that the account of the heroine’s death was the epitome of the spectral.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The man sitting opposite to me, one who has never uttered the three words ‘I don’t know,’ promptly responded that those particular paragraphs were indeed especially fine writing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From which observation I became aware that he, no more than I, had ever read the book.”Wide-eyed, my poor dyspeptic master asked him, “Fair enough, but what would you do if the other party had in fact read the book?” It appears that my master is not worried about the dishonesty of the deception, merely about the possible embarrassment of being caught out in a lie.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The question leaves the aesthete utterly unfazed.“Well, if that should happen, I’d say I’d mistaken the title or something like that,” and again, quite unconcerned, he gave himself to laughter.Though nattily tricked out in gold-rimmed spectacles, his nature is uncommonly akin to that of Rickshaw Blacky.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master said nothing, but blew out smoke rings as if in confession of his own lack of such audacity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The aesthete (the glitter of whose eyes seemed to be answering, “and no wonder; you, being you, could not even cope with watercolors”) went on aloud.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“But, joking apart, painting a picture’s a difficult thing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Leonardo da Vinci is supposed to have once told his pupils to make drawings of a stain on the Cathedral wall.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The words of a great teacher.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In a lavatory for instance, if absorbedly one studies the pattern of the rain leaks on the wall, a staggering design, a natural creation, invariably emerges.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You should keep your eyes open and try drawing from nature.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m sure you could make something interesting.”“Is this another of your tricks?”“No; this one, I promise, is seriously meant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I think that that image of the lavatory wall is really rather witty, don’t you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quite the sort of thing da Vinci would have said.”“Yes, it’s certainly witty,” my master somewhat reluctantly conceded.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But I do not think he has so far made a drawing in a lavatory.Rickshaw Blacky has recently gone lame.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His glossy fur has thinned and gradually grown dull.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His eyes, which I once praised as more beautiful than amber, are now bleared with mucus.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What I notice most is his loss of all vitality and his sheer physical deterioration.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When last I saw him in the tea garden and asked him how he was, the answer was depressingly precise: “I’ve had enough of being farted at by weasels and crippled with side-swipes from the fishmonger’s pole.”The autumn leaves, arranged in two or three scarlet terraces among the pine trees, have fallen like ancient dreams.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The red and white sasan-quas near the garden’s ornamental basin, dropping their petals, now a white and now a red one, are finally left bare.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The wintry sun along the ten-foot length of the southwards-facing veranda goes down daily earlier than yesterday.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Seldom a day goes by but a cold wind blows.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So my snoozes have been painfully curtailed.The master goes to school every day and, as soon as he returns, shuts himself up in the study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He tells all visitors that he’s tired of being a teacher.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He seldom paints.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s stopped taking his taka-diastase, saying it does no good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The children, dear little things, now trot off, day after day, to kindergarten: but on their return, they sing songs, bounce balls and sometimes hang me up by the tail.Since I do not receive any particularly nourishing food, I have not grown particularly fat; but I struggle on from day to day keeping myself more or less fit and, so far, without getting crippled.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I catch no rats.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I still detest that O-san.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No one has yet named me but, since it’s no use crying for the moon, I have resolved to remain for the rest of my life a nameless cat in the house of this teacher.IISINCE New Year’s Day I have acquired a certain modest celebrity: so that, though only a cat, I am feeling quietly proud of myself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which is not unpleasing.On the morning of New Year’s Day, my master received a picture-postcard, a card of New Year greetings from a certain painter-friend of his.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The upper part was painted red, the lower deep green; and right in the center was a crouching animal painted in pastel.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The master, sitting in his study, looked at this picture first one way up and then the other.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“What fine coloring!” he observed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having thus expressed his admiration, I thought he had finished with the matter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But no, he continued studying it, first sideways and then longways.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In order to examine the object he twists his body, then stretches out his arms like an ancient studying the Book of Divinations and then, turning to face the window, he brings it in to the tip of his nose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I wish he would soon terminate this curious performance, for the action sets his knees asway and I find it hard to keep my balance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When at long last the wobbling began to diminish, I heard him mutter in a tiny voice, “I wonder what it is.” Though full of admiration for the colors on the picture-postcard, he couldn’t identify the animal painted in its center.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which explained his extraordinary antics.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Could it perhaps really be a picture more difficult to interpret than my own first glance had suggested?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I half-opened my eyes and looked at the painting with an imperturbable calmness.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There could be no shadow of a doubt: it was a portrait of myself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I do not suppose that the painter considered himself an Andrea del Sarto, as did my master; but, being a painter, what he had painted, both in respect of form and of color, was perfectly harmonious.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Any fool could see it was a cat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And so skillfully painted that anyone with eyes in his head and the mangiest scrap of discernment would immediately recognize that it was a picture of no other cat but me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
To think that anyone should need to go to such painful lengths over such a blatantly simple matter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I felt a little sorry for the human race.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I would have liked to have let him know that the picture is of me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even if it were too difficult for him to grasp that particularity, I would still have liked to help him see that the painting is of a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But since heaven has not seen fit to dower the human animal with an ability to understand cat language, I regret to say that I let the matter be.Incidentally, I would like to take the occasion of this incident to advise my readers that the human habit of referring to me in a scornful tone of voice as some mere trifling “cat” is an extremely bad one.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Humans appear to think that cows and horses are constructed from rejected human material, and that cats are constructed from cow pats and horse dung.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such thoughts, objectively regarded, are in very poor taste though they are no doubt not uncommon among teachers who, ignorant even of their ignorance, remain self-satisfied with their quaint puffed-up ideas of their own unreal importance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even cats must not be treated roughly or taken for granted.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To the casual observer it may appear that all cats are the same, facsimiles in form and substance, as indistinguishable as peas in a pod; and that no cat can lay claim to individuality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But once admitted to feline society, that casual observer would very quickly realize that things are not so simple, and that the human saying that “people are freaks” is equally true in the world of cats.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Our eyes, noses, fur, paws—all of them differ.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From the tilt of one’s whiskers to the set of one’s ears, down to the very hang of one’s tail, we cats are sharply differentiated.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In our good looks and our poor looks, in our likes and dislikes, in our refinement and our coarsenesses, one may fairly say that cats occur in infinite variety.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Despite the fact of such obvious differentiation, humans, their eyes turned up to heaven by reason of the elevation of their minds or some such other rubbish, fail to notice even obvious differences in our external features, that our characters might be characteristic is beyond their comprehension.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which is to be pitied.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I understand and endorse the thought behind such sayings as, the cobbler should stick to his last, that birds of a feather flock together, that rice-cakes are for rice-cake makers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For cats, indeed, are for cats.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And should you wish to learn about cats, only a cat can tell you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Humans, however advanced, can tell you nothing on this subject.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And inasmuch as humans are, in fact, far less advanced than they fancy themselves, they will find it difficult even to start learning about cats.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And for an unsympathetic man like my master there’s really no hope at all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He does not even understand that love can never grow unless there is at least a complete and mutual understanding.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Like an ill-natured oyster, he secretes himself in his study and has never once opened his mouth to the outside world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And to see him there, looking as though he alone has truly attained enlightenment, is enough to make a cat laugh.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The proof that he has not attained enlightenment is that, although he has my portrait under his nose, he shows no sign of comprehension but coolly offers such crazy comment as, “perhaps, this being the second year of the war against the Russians, it is a painting of a bear.”As, with my eyes closed, I sat thinking these thoughts on my master’s knees, the servant-woman brought in a second picture-postcard.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is a printed picture of a line of four or five European cats all engaged in study, holding pens or reading books.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One has broken away from the line to perform a simple Western dance at the corner of their common desk.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Above this picture “I am a cat” is written thickly in Japanese black ink.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And down the right-hand side there is even a haiku stating that “on spring days cats read books or dance.”The card is from one of the master’s old pupils and its meaning should be obvious to anyone.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However my dimwitted master seems not to understand, for he looked puzzled and said to himself, “Can this be a Year of the Cat?” He just doesn’t seem to have grasped that these postcards are manifestations of my growing fame.At that moment the servant brought in yet a third postcard.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This time the postcard has no picture, but alongside the characters wishing my master a happy New Year, the correspondent has added those for, “Please be so kind as to give my best regards to the cat.” Bone-headed though he is, my master does appear to get the message when it’s written out thus unequivocally: for he glanced down at my face and, as if he really had at last comprehended the situation, said, “hmm.” And his glance, unlike his usual ones, did seem to contain a new modicum of respect.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which was quite right and proper considering the fact that it is entirely due to me that my master, hitherto a nobody, has suddenly begun to get a name and to attract attention.Just then the gate-bell sounded: tinkle-tinkle, possibly even ting-ting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Probably a visitor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If so, the servant will answer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since I never go out of my way to investigate callers, except the fishmonger’s errand-boy, I remained quietly on my master’s knees.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The master, however, peered worriedly toward the entrance as if duns were at the door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I deduce that he just doesn’t like receiving New Year’s callers and sharing a convivial tot.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a marvellous way to be.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How much further can pure bigotry go?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he doesn’t like visitors, he should have gone out himself, but he lacks even that much enterprise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The inaudacity of his clam-like character grows daily more apparent.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A few moments later the servant comes in to say that Mr. Coldmoon has called.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I understand that this Coldmoon person was also once a pupil of my master’s and that, after leaving school, he so rose in the world to be far better known than his teacher.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I don’t know why, but this fellow often comes round for a chat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On every such visit he babbles on, with a dreadful sort of coquettishness, about being in love or not in love with somebody or other; about how much he enjoys life or how desperately he is tired of it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And then he leaves.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is quaint enough that to discuss such matters he should seek the company of a withered old nut like my master, but it’s quainter still to see my mollusk opening up to comment, now and again, on Coldmoon’s mawkish maunderings.“I’m afraid I haven’t been round for quite some time.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Actually, I’ve been as busy as, busy since the end of last year, and, though I’ve thought of going out often enough, somehow shanks’ pony has just not headed here.” Thus, twisting and untwisting the fastening-strings of his short surcoat, Coldmoon babbled on.“Where then did shanks’ pony go?” my master enquired with a serious look as he tugged at the cuffs of his worn, black, crested surcoat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is a cotton garment unduly short in the sleeves, and some of its nonde-script, thin, silk lining sticks out about a half an inch at the cuffs.“As it were in various directions,” Coldmoon answered, and then laughed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I notice that one of his front teeth is missing.“What’s happened to your teeth?” asks my master, changing the subject.“Well, actually, at a certain place I ate mushrooms.”“What did you say you ate?”“A bit of mushroom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I tried to bite off a mushroom’s umbrella with my front teeth, a tooth just broke off.”“Breaking teeth on a mushroom sounds somewhat senile.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An image possibly appropriate to a haiku but scarcely appropriate to the pursuit of love,” remarked my master as he tapped lightly on my head with the palm of his hand.“Ah!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is that the cat?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But he’s quite plump!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sturdy as that, not even Rickshaw Blacky could beat him up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He certainly is a most splendid beast.” Coldmoon offers me his homage.“He’s grown quite big lately,” responds my master, and proudly smacks me twice upon the head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am flattered by the compliment but my head feels slightly sore.“The night before last, what’s more, we had a little concert,” said Coldmoon going back to his story.“Where?”“Surely you don’t have to know where.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But it was quite interesting, three violins to a piano accompaniment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However unskilled, when there are three of them, violins sound fairly good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Two of them were women and I managed to place myself between them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And I myself, I thought, played rather well.”“Ah, and who were the women?” enviously my master asks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At first glance my master usually looks cold and hard; but, to tell the truth, he is by no means indifferent to women.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He once read in a Western novel of a man who invariably fell partially in love with practically every woman that he met.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Another character in the book somewhat sarcastically observed that, as a rough calculation, that fellow fell in love with just under seven-tenths of the women he passed in the street.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On reading this, my master was struck by its essential truth and remained deeply impressed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Why should a man so impressionable lead such an oysterish existence?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A mere cat such as I cannot possibly understand it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Some say it is the result of a love affair that went wrong; some say it is due to his weak stomach; while others simply state that it’s because he lacks both money and audacity.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whatever the truth, it doesn’t much matter since he’s a person of insufficient importance to affect the history of his period.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What is certain is that he did enquire enviously about Coldmoon’s female fiddlers.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldmoon, looking amused, picked up a sliver of boiled fishpaste in his chopsticks and nipped at it with his remaining front teeth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was worried lest another should fall out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But this time it was all right.“Well, both of them are daughters of good families.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You don’t know them,” Coldmoon coldly answered.The master drawled “Is—th-a-t—,” but omitted the final “so” which he’d intended.Coldmoon probably considered it was about time to be off, for he said, “What marvellous weather.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you’ve nothing better to do, shall we go out for a walk?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As a result of the fall of Port Arthur,” he added encouragingly, “the town’s unusually lively.”My master, looking as though he would sooner discuss the identity of the female fiddlers than the fall of Port Arthur, hesitated for a moment’s thought.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But he seemed finally to reach a decision, for he stood up resolutely and said, “All right, let’s go out.” He continues to wear his black cotton crested surcoat and, thereunder, a quilted kimono of hand-woven silk which, supposedly a keep-sake of his elder brother, he has worn continuously for twenty years.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even the most strongly woven silk, cannot survive such unremitting, such preternaturally, perennial wear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The material has been worn so thin that, held against the light, one can see the patches sewn on here and there from the inner side.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master wears the same clothes throughout December and January, not bothering to observe the traditional New Year change.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He makes, indeed, no distinction between workaday and Sunday clothes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
When he leaves the house he saunters out in whatever dress he happens to have on.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I do not know whether this is because he has no other clothes to wear or whether, having such clothes, he finds it too much of a bore to change into them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whatever the case, I can’t conceive that these uncouth habits are in any way connected with disappointment in love.After the two men left, I took the liberty of eating such of the boiled fishpaste as Coldmoon had not already devoured.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am, these days, no longer just a common, old cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I consider myself at least as good as those celebrated in the tales of Momokawa Joen or as that cat of Thomas Gray’s, which trawled for goldfish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Brawlers such as Rickshaw Blacky are now beneath my notice.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I don’t suppose anyone will make a fuss if I sneak a bit of fishpaste.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Besides, this habit of taking secret snacks between meals is by no means a purely feline custom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"O-san, for instance, is always pinching cakes and things, which she gobbles down whenever the mistress leaves the house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nor is O-san the only offender: even the children, of whose refined upbringing the mistress is continually bragging, display the selfsame tendency.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Only a few days ago that precious pair woke at some ungodly hour, and, though their parents were still sound asleep, took it upon themselves to sit down, face-to-face, at the dining-table.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now it is my master’s habit every morning to consume most of a loaf of bread, and to give the children scraps thereof which they eat with a dusting of sugar.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It so happened that on this day the sugar basin was already on the table, even a spoon stuck in it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since there was no one there to dole them out their sugar, the elder child scooped up a spoonful and dumped it on her plate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The younger followed her elder’s fine example and spooned an equal pile of sugar onto another plate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For a brief while these charming creatures just sat and glared at each other.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then the elder girl scooped a second spoonful onto her plate, and the younger one proceeded to equalize the position.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The elder sister took a third spoonful and the younger, in a splendid spirit of rivalry, followed suit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And so it went on until both plates were piled high with sugar and not one single grain remained in the basin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master thereupon emerged from his bedroom rubbing half-sleepy eyes and proceeded to return the sugar, so laboriously extracted by his daughters, back into the sugar-basin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This incident suggests that, though egotistical egalitarianism may be more highly developed among humans than among cats, cats are the wiser creatures.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My advice to the children would have been to lick the sugar up quickly before it became massed into such senseless pyramids, but, because they cannot understand what I say, I merely watched them in silence from my warm, morning place on top of the container for boiled rice.My master came home late last night from his expedition with Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"God knows where he went, but it was already past nine before he sat down at the breakfast table.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From my same old place I watched his morose consumption of a typical New Year’s breakfast of rice-cakes boiled with vegetables, all served up in soup.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He takes endless helpings.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though the rice-cakes are admittedly small, he must have eaten some six or seven before leaving the last one floating in the bowl.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I’ll stop now,” he remarked and laid his chopsticks down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Should anyone else behave in such a spoilt manner, he could be relied upon to put his foot down: but, vain in the exercise of his petty authority as master of the house, he seems quite unconcerned by the sight of the corpse of a scorched rice-cake drowning in turbid soup.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When his wife took taka-diastase from the back of a small cupboard and put it on the table, my master said, “I won’t take it, it does me no good.”“But they say it’s very good after eating starchy things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I think you should take some.” His wife wants him to take it.“Starchy or not, the stuff’s no good.” He remains stubborn.“Really, you are a most capricious man,” the mistress mutters as though to herself.“I’m not capricious, the medicine doesn’t work.”“But until the other day you used to say it worked very well and you used to take it every day, didn’t you?”“Yes, it did work until that other day, but it hasn’t worked since then,” an antithetical answer.“If you continue in these inconsistencies, taking it one day and stopping it the next, however efficacious the medicine may be, it will never do you any good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unless you try to be a little more patient, dyspepsia, unlike other illnesses, won’t get cured, will it?” and she turns to O-san who was serving at the table.“Quite so, madam.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unless one takes it regularly, one cannot find out whether a medicine is a good one or a bad one.” O-san readily sides with the mistress.“I don’t care.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I don’t take it because I don’t take it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How can a mere woman understand such things?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Keep quiet.”“All right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m merely a woman,” she says pushing the taka-diastase toward him, quite determined to make him see he is beaten.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master stands up without saying a word and goes off into his study.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His wife and servant exchange looks and giggle.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If on such occasions I follow him and jump up onto his knees, experience tells me that I shall pay dearly for my folly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, I go quietly round through the garden and hop up onto the veranda outside his study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I peeped through the slit between the paper sliding doors and found my master examining a book by somebody called Epictetus.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he could actually understand what he’s reading, then he would indeed be worthy of praise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But within five or six minutes he slams the book down on the table, which is just what I’d suspected.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I sat there watching him, he took out his diary and made the following entry.Took a stroll with Coldmoon round Nezu, Ueno, Ikenohata and Kanda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At Ikenohata, geishas in formal spring kimono were playing battledore and shuttlecock in front of a house of assignation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Their clothes beautiful, but their faces extremely plain.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It occurs to me that they resemble the cat at home.I don’t see why he should single me out as an example of plain features.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I went to a barber and had my face shaved, I wouldn’t look much different from a human.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, there you are, humans are conceited and that’s the trouble with them.As we turned at Hotan’s corner another geisha appeared.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She was slim, well-shaped and her shoulders were most beautifully sloped.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The way she wore her mauve kimono gave her a genuine elegance.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Sorry about last night, Gen-chan—I was so busy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.” She laughed and one glimpsed white teeth.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her voice was so harsh, as harsh as that of a roving crow, that her otherwise fine appearance diminished in enchantment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So much so that I didn’t even bother to turn around to see what sort of person this Gen-chan was, but sauntered on toward Onarimachi with my hands tucked inside the breast-fold of my kimono.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldmoon, however, seemed to have become a trifle fidgety.There is nothing more difficult than understanding human mentality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master’s present mental state is very far from clear; is he feeling angry or lighthearted, or simply seeking solace in the scribblings of some dead philosopher?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One just can’t tell whether he’s mocking the world or yearning to be accepted into its frivolous company; whether he is getting furious over some piddling little matter or holding himself aloof from worldly things.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Compared with such complexities, cats are truly simple.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If we want to eat, we eat; if we want to sleep, we sleep; when we are angry, we are angry utterly; when we cry, we cry with all the desperation of extreme commitment to our grief.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Thus we never keep things like diaries.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For what would be the point?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No doubt human beings like my two-faced master find it necessary to keep diaries in order to display in a darkened room that true character so assiduously hidden from the world.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But among cats both our four main occupations (walking, standing, sitting, and lying down) and such incidental activities as excreting waste are pursued quite openly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We live our diaries, and consequently have no need to keep a daily record as a means of maintaining our real characters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Had I the time to keep a diary, I’d use that time to better effect; sleeping on the veranda.We dined somewhere in Kanda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Because I allowed myself one or two cups of saké (which I had not tasted for quite a time), my stomach this morning feels extremely well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I conclude that the best remedy for a stomach ailment is saké at suppertime.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Taka-diastase just won’t do.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whatever claims are made for it, it’s just no good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That which lacks effect will continue to lack effect.Thus with his brush he smears the good name of taka-diastase.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is as though he quarreled with himself, and in this entry one can see a last flash of this morning’s ugly mood.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such entries are perhaps most characteristic of human mores.The other day, Mr. X claimed that going without one’s breakfast helped the stomach.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So I took no breakfast for two or three days but the only effect was to make my stomach grumble.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Mr. Y strongly advised me to refrain from eating pickles.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"According to him, all disorders of the stomach originate in pickles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His thesis was that abstinence from pickles so dessicates the sources of all stomach trouble, that a complete cure must follow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For at least a week no pickle crossed my lips, but, since that banishment produced no noticeable effect, I have resumed consuming them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"According to Mr. Z, the one true remedy is ventral massage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But no ordinary massage of the stomach would suffice.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It must be massage in accordance with the old-world methods of the Minagawa School.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Massaged thus once, or at most twice, the stomach would be rid of every ill.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The wisest scholars, such as Yasui Sokuken, and the most resourceful heroes, such as Sakamoto Ryoma, all relied upon this treatment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So off I went to Kaminegishi for an immediate massage.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the methods used were of inordinate cruelty.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They told me, for instance, that no good could be hoped for unless one’s bones were massaged; that it would be difficult properly to eradicate my troubles unless, at least once, my viscera were totally inverted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At all events, a single session reduced my body to the condition of cotton-wool and I felt as though I had become a lifelong sufferer from sleeping sickness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I never went there again.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Once was more than enough.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then Mr. A assured me that one shouldn’t eat solids.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So I spent a whole day drinking nothing but milk.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My bowels gave forth heavy plopping noises as though they had been swamped, and I could not sleep all night.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Mr. B states that exercising one’s intestines by diaphragmic breathing produces a naturally healthy stomach and he counsels me to follow his advice.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And I did try.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For a time.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But it proved no good for it made my bowels queasy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Besides, though every now and again I strive with all my heart and soul to control my breathing with the diaphragm, in five or six minutes I forget to discipline my muscles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And if I concentrate on maintaining that discipline I get so midriff-minded that I can neither read nor write.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse, my aesthete friend, once found me thus breathing in pursuit of a naturally healthy stomach and, rather unkindly, urged me, as a man, to terminate my labor-pangs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So diaphragmic breathing is now also a thing of the past.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Dr. C recommends a diet of buckwheat noodles.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So buckwheat noodles it was, alternately in soup and served cold after boiling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It did nothing, except loosen my bowels.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have tried every possible means to cure my ancient ailment, but all of them are useless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But those three cups of saké which I drank last night with Coldmoon have certainly done some good.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From now on, I will drink two or three cups each evening.I doubt whether this saké treatment will be kept up very long.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master’s mind exhibits the same incessant changeability as can be seen in the eyes of cats.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He has no sense of perseverance.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, moreover, idiotic that, while he fills his diary with lamentation over his stomach troubles, he does his best to present a brave face to the world; to grin and bear it.The other day his scholar friend, Professor Whatnot, paid a visit and advanced the theory that it was at least arguable that every illness is the direct result of both ancestral and personal malefaction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He seemed to have studied the matter pretty deeply for the sequence of his logic was clear, consistent, and orderly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Altogether it was a fine theory.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am sorry to say that my master has neither the brain nor the erudition to rebut such theories.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, perhaps because he himself was actually suffering from stomach trouble, he felt obliged to make all sorts of face-saving excuses.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He irrelevantly retorted, “Your theory is interesting, but are you aware that Carlyle was dyspeptic?” as if claiming that because Carlyle was dyspeptic his own dyspepsia was an intellectual honor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His friend replied,“It does not follow that because Carlyle was a dyspeptic, all dyspeptics are Carlyles.” My master, reprimanded, held his tongue, but the incident revealed his curious vanity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s all the more amusing when one recalls that he would probably prefer not to be dyspeptic, for just this morning he recorded in his diary an intention to take treatment by saké as from tonight.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now that I’ve come to think of it, his inordinate consumption of rice-cakes this morning must have been the effect of last night’s saké session with Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I could have eaten those cakes myself.Though I am a cat, I eat practically anything.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unlike Rickshaw Blacky, I lack the energy to go off raiding fishshops up distant alleys.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Further, my social status is such that I cannot expect the luxury enjoyed by Tortoiseshell whose mistress teaches the idle rich to play on the two-stringed harp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Therefore I don’t, as others can, indulge myself in likes and dislikes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I eat small bits of bread left over by the children, and I lick the jam from bean-jam cakes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Pickles taste awful, but to broaden my experience I once tried a couple of slices of pickled radish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s a strange thing but once I’ve tried it, almost anything turns out edible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To say, “I don’t like that” or “I don’t like this” is mere extravagant willfulness, and a cat that lives in a teacher’s house should eschew such foolish remarks.According to my master, there was once a novelist whose name was Balzac and he lived in France.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He was an extremely extravagant man.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I do not mean an extravagant eater but that, being a novelist, he was extravagant in his writing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One day he was trying to find a suitable name for a character in the novel he was writing, but, for whatever reason, could not think of a name that pleased him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just then one of his friends called by, and Balzac suggested they should go out for a walk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This friend had, of course, no idea why, still less that Balzac was determined to find the name he needed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Out on the streets, Balzac did nothing but stare at shop signboards, but still he couldn’t find a suitable name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He marched on endlessly, while his puzzled friend, still ignorant of the object of the expedition, tagged along behind him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having fruitlessly explored Paris from morning till evening, they were on their way home when Balzac happened to notice a tailor’s signboard bearing the name “Marcus.” He clapped his hands.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“This is it,” he shouted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“It just has to be this.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Marcus is a good name, but with a Z in front of Marcus it becomes a perfect name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It has to be a Z.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Z. Marcus is remarkably good.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Names that I invent are never good.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They sound unnatural however cleverly constructed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But now, at long, long last, I’ve got the name I like.” Balzac, extremely pleased with himself, was totally oblivious to the inconvenience he had caused his friend.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would seem unduly troublesome that one should have to spend a whole day trudging around Paris merely to find a name for a character in a novel.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Extravagance of such enormity acquires a certain splendor, but folk like me, a cat kept by a clam-like introvert, cannot even envisage such inordinate behavior.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That I should not much care what, so long as it’s edible, I eat is probably an inevitable result of my circumstances.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Thus it was in no way as an expression of extravagance that I expressed just now my feeling of wishing to eat a rice-cake.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I simply thought that I’d better eat while the chance offered, and I then remembered that the piece of rice-cake which my master had left in his breakfast bowl was possibly still in the kitchen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So round to the kitchen I went.The rice-cake was stuck, just as I saw it this morning, at the bottom of the bowl and its color was still as I remembered it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I must confess that I’ve never previously tasted rice-cake.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet, though I felt a shade uncertain, it looks quite good to eat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
With a tentative front paw I rake at the green vegetables adhering to the rice-cake.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My claws, having touched the outer part of the rice-cake, become sticky.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I sniff at them and recognize the smell that can be smelt when rice stuck at the bottom of a cooking-pot is transferred into the boiled-rice container.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I look around, wondering, “Shall I eat it, shall I not?” Fortunately, or unfortunately, there’s nobody about.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"O-san, with a face that shows no change between year end and the spring, is playing battledore and shuttlecock.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The children in the inner room are singing something about a rabbit and a tortoise.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I am to eat this New Year speciality, now’s the moment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I miss this chance I shall have to spend a whole, long year not knowing how a rice-cake tastes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At this point, though a mere cat, I perceived a truth: that golden opportunity makes all animals venture to do even those things they do not want to do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To tell the truth, I do not particularly want to eat the rice-cake.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In fact the more I examined the thing at the bottom of the bowl the more nervous I became and the more keenly disinclined to eat it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If only O-san would open the kitchen door, or if I could hear the children’s footsteps coming toward me, I would unhesitatingly abandon the bowl; not only that, I would have put away all thought of rice-cakes for another year.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But no one comes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve hesitated long enough.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Still no one comes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I feel as if someone were hotly urging me on, someone whispering, “Eat it, quickly!” I looked into the bowl and prayed that someone would appear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But no one did.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I shall have to eat the rice-cake after all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the end, lowering the entire weight of my body into the bottom of the bowl, I bit about an inch deep into a corner of the rice-cake.Most things that I bite that hard come clean off in my mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But what a surprise!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For I found when I tried to reopen my jaw that it would not budge.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I try once again to bite my way free, but find I’m stuck.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Too late I realize that the rice-cake is a fiend.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When a man who has fallen into a marsh struggles to escape, the more he thrashes about trying to extract his legs, the deeper in he sinks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just so, the harder I clamp my jaws, the more my mouth grows heavy and my teeth immobilized.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I can feel the resistance to my teeth, but that’s all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I cannot dispose of it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse, the aesthete, once described my master as an aliquant man and I must say it’s rather a good description.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This rice-cake too, like my master, is aliquant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It looked to me that, however much I continued biting, nothing could ever result: the process could go on and on eternally like the division of ten by three.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In the middle of this anguish I found my second truth: that all animals can tell by instinct what is or is not good for them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Although I have now discovered two great truths, I remain unhappy by reason of the adherent rice-cake.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My teeth are being sucked into its body, and are becoming excruciatingly painful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unless I can complete my bite and run away quickly, O-san will be on me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The children seem to have stopped singing, and I’m sure they’ll soon come running into the kitchen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In an extremity of anguish, I lashed about with my tail, but to no effect.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I made my ears stand up and then lie flat, but this didn’t help either.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Come to think of it, my ears and tail have nothing to do with the rice-cake.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In short, I had indulged in a waste of wagging, a waste of ear-erection, and a waste of ear-flattening.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So I stopped.At long last it dawned on me that the best thing to do is to force the rice-cake down by using my two front paws.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
First I raised my right paw and stroked it around my mouth.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Naturally, this mere stroking brought no relief whatsoever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Next, I stretched out my left paw and with it scraped quick circles around my mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
These ineffectual passes failed to exorcize the fiend in the rice-cake.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Realizing that it was essential to proceed with patience, I scraped alternatively with my right and left paws, but my teeth stayed stuck in the rice-cake.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Growing impatient, I now used both front paws simultaneously.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, only then, I found to my amazement that I could actually stand up on my hind legs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Somehow I feel un-catlike.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But not caring whether I am a cat or not, I scratch away like mad at my whole face in frenzied determination to keep on scratching until the fiend in the rice-cake has been driven out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Since the movements of my front paws are so vigorous I am in danger of losing my balance and falling down.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
To keep my equilibrium I find myself marking time with my hind legs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I begin to tittup from one spot to another, and I finish up prancing madly all over the kitchen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It gives me great pride to realize that I can so dextrously maintain an upright position, and the revelation of a third great truth is thus vouchsafed me: that in conditions of exceptional danger one can surpass one’s normal level of achievement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This is the real meaning of Special Providence.Sustained by Special Providence, I am fighting for dear life against that demonic rice-cake when I hear footsteps.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Someone seems to be approaching.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thinking it would be fatal to be caught in this predicament, I redouble my efforts and am positively running around the kitchen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The footsteps come closer and closer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Alas, that Special Providence seems not to last forever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the end I am discovered by the children who loudly shout, “Why look!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The cat’s been eating rice-cakes and is dancing.” The first to hear their announcement was that O-san person.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Abandoning her shuttlecock and battledore, she flew in through the kitchen door crying, “Gracious me!” Then the mistress, sedate in her formal silk kimono, deigns to remark, “What a naughty cat.” And my master, drawn from his study by the general hubbub, shouts, “You fool!” The children find me funniest, but by general agreement the whole household is having a good old laugh.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is annoying, it is painful, it is impossible to stop dancing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Hell and damnation!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When at long last the laughter began to die down, the dear, little five-year-old piped up with an, “Oh what a comical cat,” which had the effect of renewing the tide of their ebbing laughter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They fairly split their sides.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have already heard and seen quite a lot of heartless human behavior, but never before have I felt so bitterly critical of their conduct.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Special Providence having vanished into thin air, I was back in my customary position on all fours, finally at my wit’s end, and, by reason of giddiness, cutting a quite ridiculous figure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master seems to have felt it would be perhaps a pity to let me die before his very eyes, for he said to O-san, “Help him get rid of that rice-cake.” O-san looks at the mistress as if to say, “Why not make him go on dancing?” The mistress would gladly see my minuet continued, but, since she would not go so far as wanting me to dance myself to death, says nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master turned somewhat sharply to the servant and ordered, “Hurry it up, if you don’t help quickly the cat will be dead.” O-san, with a vacant look on her face, as though she had been roughly wakened from some peculiarly delicious dream, took a firm grip on the rice-cake and yanked it out of my mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am not quite as feeble-fanged as Coldmoon, but I really did think my entire front toothwork was about to break off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The pain was indescribable.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The teeth embedded in the rice-cake are being pitilessly wrenched.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You can’t imagine what it was like.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was then that the fourth enlightenment burst upon me: that all comfort is achieved through hardship.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When at last I came to myself and looked around at a world restored to normality, all the members of the household had disappeared into the inner room.Having made such a fool of myself, I feel quite unable to face such hostile critics as O-san.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would, I think, unhinge my mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To restore my mental tranquillity, I decided to visit Tortoiseshell, so I left the kitchen and set off through the backyard to the house of the two-stringed harp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Tortoiseshell is a celebrated beauty in our district.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though I am undoubtedly a cat, I possess a wide general knowledge of the nature of compassion and am deeply sensitive to affection, kind-heartedness, tenderness, and love.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Merely to observe the bitterness in my master’s face, just to be snubbed by O-san, leaves me out of sorts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At such times I visit this fair, lady friend of mine and our conversation ranges over many things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, before I am aware of it, I find myself refreshed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I forget my worries, hardships, everything.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel as if reborn.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Female influence is indeed a most potent thing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Through a gap in the cedar-hedge, I peer to see if she is anywhere about.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tortoiseshell, wearing a smart new collar in celebration of the season, is sitting very neatly on her veranda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The rondure of her back is indescribably beautiful.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is the most beautiful of all curved lines.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The way her tail curves, the way she folds her legs, the charmingly lazy shake of her ears—all these are quite beyond description.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She looks so warm sitting there so gracefully in the very sunniest spot.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Her body holds an attitude of utter stillness and correctness.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And her fur, glossy as velvet that reflects the rays of spring, seems suddenly to quiver although the air is still.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For a while I stood, completely enraptured, gazing at her.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then as I came to myself, I softly called, “Miss Tortoiseshell, Miss Tortoiseshell,” and beckoned with my paw.“Why, Professor,” she greeted me as she stepped down from the veranda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A tiny bell attached to her scarlet collar made little tinkling sounds.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I say to myself, “Ah, it’s for the New Year that she’s wearing a bell,” and, while I am still admiring its lively tinkle, find she has arrived beside me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“A happy NewYear, Professor,” and she waves her tail to the left; for when cats exchange greetings one first holds one’s tail upright like a pole, then twists it round to the left.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In our neighborhood it is only Tortoiseshell who calls me Professor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, I have already mentioned that I have, as yet, no name; it is Tortoiseshell, and she alone, who pays me the respect due to one that lives in a teacher’s house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I am not altogether displeased to be addressed as a Professor, and respond willingly to her apostrophe.“And a happy New Year to you,” I say.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“How beautifully you’re done up!”“Yes, the mistress bought it for me at the end of last year.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Isn’t it nice?” and she makes it tinkle for me.“Yes indeed, it has a lovely sound.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve never seen such a wonderful thing in my life.”“No!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Everyone’s using them,” and she tinkle-tinkles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“But isn’t it a lovely sound?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m so happy.” She tinkle-tinkle-tinkles continuously.“I can see your mistress loves you very dearly.” Comparing my lot with hers, I hinted at my envy of a pampered life.Tortoiseshell is a simple creature.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Yes,” she says, “that’s true; she treats me as if I were her own child.” And she laughs innocently.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is not true that cats never laugh.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Human beings are mistaken in their belief that only they are capable of laughter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
When I laugh my nostrils grow triangular and my Adam’s apple trembles.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No wonder human beings fail to understand it.“What is your master really like?”“My master?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That sounds strange.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Mine is a mistress.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A mistress of the two stringed harp.”“I know that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But what is her background?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I imagine she’s a person of high birth?”“Ah, yes.”A small Princess-pineWhile waiting for you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".Beyond the sliding paper-door the mistress begins to play on her two-stringed harp.“Isn’t that a splendid voice?” Tortoiseshell is proud of it.“It seems extremely good, but I don’t understand what she’s singing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What’s the name of the piece?”“That?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Oh, it’s called something or other.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The mistress is especially fond of it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"D’you know, she’s actually sixty-two?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But in excellent condition, don’t you think?”I suppose one has to admit that she’s in excellent condition if she’s still alive at sixty-two.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So I answered, “Yes.” I thought to myself that I’d given a silly answer, but I could do no other since I couldn’t think of anything brighter to say.“You may not think so, but she used to be a person of high standing.She always tells me so.”“What was she originally?”“I understand that she’s the thirteenth Shogun’s widowed wife’s private-secretary’s younger sister’s husband’s mother’s nephew’s daughter.”“What?”“The thirteenth Shogun’s widowed wife’s private-secretary’s younger sister’s.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"There are times for little white lies.Beyond the sliding paper-door the sound of the two-stringed harp came to a sudden stop and the mistress’ voice called, “Tortoiseshell, Tortoiseshell, your lunch is ready.” Tortoiseshell looked happy and remarked, “There, she’s calling, so I must go home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I hope you’ll forgive me?” What would be the good of my saying that I mind?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Come and see me again,” she said; and she ran off through the garden tinkling her bell.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But suddenly she turned and came back to ask me anxiously, “You’re looking far from well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is anything wrong?” I couldn’t very well tell her that I’d eaten a rice-cake and gone dancing; so, “No,” I said, “nothing in particular.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I did some weighty thinking, which brought on something of a headache.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Indeed I called today because I fancied that just to talk with you would help me to feel better.”“Really?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, take good care of yourself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Good-bye now.” She seemed a tiny bit sorry to leave me, which has completely restored me to the liveliness I’d felt before the rice-cake bit me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I now felt wonderful and decided to go home through that tea-plantation where one could have the pleasure of treading down lumps of half-melted frost.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Nowadays I’m no longer scared of Blacky, but, since any conversation with him involves the risk of trouble, I endeavor to pass, cutting him off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But it’s not in Blacky’s nature to contain his feelings if he believes himself looked down upon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Hey you, Mr. No-name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’re very stuck-up these days, now aren’t you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"I wish I could explain the situation to him, but, since he’s not the kind who can understand such things, I decide simply to offer him the briefest of greetings and then to take my leave as soon as I decently can.“A happy New Year, Mr. Blacky.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You do look well, as usual.” And I lift up my tail and twist it to the left.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Blacky, keeping his tail straight up, refused to return my salutation.“What!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Happy?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If the New Year’s happy, then you should be out of your tiny mind the whole year round.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now push off sharp, you back-end of a bellows.”That turn of phrase about the back-end of a bellows sounds distinctly derogatory, but its semantic content happened to escape me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

I give up!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I really do!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You really are a New Year’s nit.”A New Year’s nit sounds somewhat poetic, but its meaning is even more obscure than that bit about the bellows.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I would have liked to ask the meaning for my future reference, but, as it was obvious I’d get no clear answer, I just stood facing him without a word.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was actually feeling rather awkward, but just then the wife of Blacky’s master suddenly screamed out, “Where in hell is that cut of salmon I left here on the shelf?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

That’s the nastiest cat I’ve ever seen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"See what he’ll get when he comes back!” Her raucous voice unceremoniously shakes the mild air of the season, vulgarizing its natural peacefulness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Blacky puts on an impudent look as if to say, “If you want to scream your head off, scream away,” and he jerked his square chin forward at me as if to say, “Did you hear that hullaballoo?” Up to this point I’ve been too busy talking to Blacky to notice or think about anything else; but now, glancing down, I see between his legs a mud-covered bone from the cheapest cut of salmon.“So you’ve been at it again!” Forgetting our recent exchanges, I offered Blacky my usual flattering exclamation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But it was not enough to restore him to good humor.“Been at it!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What the hell d’you mean, you saucy blockhead?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And what do you mean by saying ‘again’ when this is nothing but a skinny slice of the cheapest fish?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t you know who I am!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m Rickshaw Blacky, damn you.” And, having no shirtsleeves to roll up, he lifts an aggressive right front-paw as high as his shoulder.“I’ve always known you were Mr. Rickshaw Blacky.”“If you knew, why the hell did you say I’d been at it again?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Answer me!” And he blows out over me great gusts of oven breath.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

O.K.?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Understand?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Beef that isn’t tough.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A pound of it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
See?” Her beef-demanding tones shatter the peace of the whole neighborhood.“It’s only once a year she orders beef and that’s why she shouts so loud.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She wants the entire neighborhood to know about her marvellous pound of beef.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What can one do with a woman like that!” asked Blacky jeeringly as he stretched all four of his legs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I can find nothing to say in reply, I keep silent and watch.“A miserable pound just simply will not do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But I reckon it can’t be helped.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Hang on to that beef.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ll have it later.” Blacky communes with himself as though the beef had been ordered specially for him.“This time you’re in for a real treat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That’s wonderful!” With these words I’d hoped to pack him off to his home.But Blacky snarled, “That’s nothing to do with you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just shut your big mouth, you!” and using his strong hind-legs, he suddenly scrabbles up a torrent of fallen icicles which thuds down on my head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was taken completely aback, and, while I was still busy shaking the muddy debris off my body, Blacky slid off through the hedge and disappeared.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Presumably to possess himself of Westbrook’s beef.When I get home I find the place unusually springlike and even the master is laughing gaily.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Wondering why, I hopped onto the veranda, and, as I padded to sit beside the master, noticed an unfamiliar guest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His hair is parted neatly and he wears a crested cotton surcoat and a duck-cloth hakama.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He looks like a student and, at that, an extremely serious one.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Lying on the corner of my master’s small hand-warming brazier, right beside the lacquer cigarette-box, there’s a visiting card on which is written, “To introduce Mr. Beauchamp Blowlamp: from Coldmoon.”Which tells me both the name of this guest and the fact that he’s a friend of Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The conversation going on between host and guest sounds enigmatic because I missed the start of it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I gather that it has something to do with Waverhouse, the aesthete whom I have had previous occasion to mention.“And he urged me to come along with him because it would involve an ingenious idea, he said.” The guest is talking calmly.“Do you mean there was some ingenious idea involved in lunching at aWestern style restaurant?” My master pours more tea for the guest and pushes the cup toward him.“Well, at the time I did not understand what this ingenious idea could be, but, since it was his idea, I thought it bound to be something interesting and.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“So you accompanied him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I see.”“Yes, but I got a surprise.”The master, looking as if to say, “I told you so,” gives me a whack on the head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which hurts a little.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I expect it proved somewhat farcical.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s rather that way inclined.” Clearly, he has suddenly remembered that business with Andrea del Sarto.“Ah yes?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, as he suggested we would be eating something special.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“What did you have?”“First of all, while studying the menu, he gave me all sorts of information about food.”“Before ordering any?”“Yes.”“And then?”“And then, turning to a waiter, he said, ‘There doesn’t seem to be anything special on the card.’ The waiter, not to be outdone, suggested roast duck or veal chops.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Whereupon Waverhouse remarked quite sharply that we hadn’t come a very considerable distance just for common or garden fare.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The waiter, who didn’t understand the significance of common or garden, looked puzzled and said nothing.”“So I would imagine.”“Then, turning to me, Waverhouse observed that in France or in England one can obtain any amount of dishes cooked à la Tenmei or à la Manyō but that in Japan, wherever you go, the food is all so stereotyped that one doesn’t even feel tempted to enter a restaurant of the so-called Western style.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And so on and so on.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He was in tremendous form.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But has he ever been abroad?”“Waverhouse abroad?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Of course not.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s got the money and the time.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he wanted to, he could go off anytime.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He probably just converted his future intention to travel into the past tense of widely traveled experience as a sort of joke.” The master flatters himself that he has said something witty and laughs invitingly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His guest looks largely unimpressed.“I see.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wondered when he’d been abroad.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I took everything he said quite seriously.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Besides, he described such things as snail soup and stewed frogs as though he’d really seen them with his own two eyes.”“He must have heard about them from someone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s adept at such terminological inexactitudes.”“So it would seem,” and Beauchamp stares down at the narcissus in a vase.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He seems a little disappointed.“So, that then was his ingenious idea, I take it?” asks the master still in quest of certainties.“No, that was only the beginning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The main part’s still to come.”“Ah!”The master utters an interjection mingled with curiosity.“Having finished his dissertation on matters gastronomical and European, he proposed ‘since it’s quite impossible to obtain snails or frogs, however much we may desire them, let’s at least have moat-bells.What do you say?’ And without really giving the matter any thought at all, I answered, ‘Yes, that would be fine.’”“Moat-bells sound a little odd.”“Yes, very odd, but because Waverhouse was speaking so seriously, I didn’t then notice the oddity.” He seems to be apologizing to my master for his carelessness.“What happened next?” asks my master quite indifferently and without any sign of sympathetic response to his guest’s implied apology.“Well, then he told the waiter to bring moat-bells for two.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The waiter said,‘Do you mean meatballs, sir?’ but Waverhouse, assuming an ever more serious expression, corrected him with gravity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘No, not meatballs, moat-bells.’”“Really?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But is there any such dish as moat-bells?”“Well I thought it sounded somewhat strange, but as Waverhouse was so calmly sure and is so great an authority on all things Occidental—remember it was then my firm belief that he was widely traveled—I too joined in and explained to the waiter,‘Moat-bells, my good man, moat-bells.’”“What did the waiter do?”“The waiter—it’s really rather funny now one comes to think back on it—looked thoughtful for a while and then said, ‘I’m terribly sorry sir, but today, unfortunately, we have no moat-bells.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though should you care for meatballs we could serve you, sir, immediately.’ Waverhouse thereupon looked extremely put out and said, ‘So we’ve come all this long way for nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Couldn’t you really manage moat-bells?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Please do see what can be done,’ and he slipped a small tip to the waiter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The waiter said he would ask the cook again and went off into the kitchen.”“He must have had his mind dead set on eating moat-bells.”“After a brief interval the waiter returned to say that if moat-bells were ordered specially they could be provided, but that it would take a long time.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Waverhouse was quite composed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He said, ‘It’s the New Year and we are in no kind of hurry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So let’s wait for it?’ He drew a cigar from the inside of his Western suit and lighted up in the most leisurely manner.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I felt called upon to match his cool composure so, taking the Japan News from my kimono pocket, I started reading it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The waiter retired for further consultations.”“What a business!” My master leans forward, showing quite as much enthusiasm as he does when reading war news in the dailies.“The waiter re-emerged with apologies and the confession that, of late, the ingredients of moat-bells were in such short supply that one could not get them at Kameya’s nor even down at No.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"15 in Yokohama.He expressed regret, but it seemed certain that the material for moat-bells would not be back in stock for some considerable time.Waverhouse then turned to me and repeated, over and over again,‘What a pity, and we came especially for that dish.’ I felt that I had to say something, so I joined him in saying,‘Yes, it’s a terrible shame!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, a great, great pity!’”“Quite so,” agrees my master, though I myself don’t follow his reasoning.“These observations must have made the waiter feel quite sorry, for he said,‘When, one of these days, we do have the necessary ingredients, we’d be happy if you would come, sir, and sample our fare.’ But when Waverhouse proceeded to ask him what ingredients the restaurant did use, the waiter just laughed and gave no answer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse then pressingly enquired if the key-ingredient happened to be Tochian (who, as you know, is a haiku poet of the Nihon School); and d’you know, the waiter answered,‘Yes, it is, sir, and that is precisely why none is currently available even in Yokohama.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am indeed,’ he added, ‘most regretful, sir.’”“Ha-ha-ha!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So that’s the point of the story?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How very funny!” and the master, quite unlike his usual self, roars with laughter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His knees shake so much that I nearly tumble off.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Paying no regard to my predicament, the master laughs and laughs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He seems suddenly deeply pleased to realize that he is not alone in being gulled by Andrea del Sarto.“And then, as soon as we were out in the street, he said ‘You see, we’ve done well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That ploy about the moat-bells was really rather good, wasn’t it?’ and he looked as pleased as punch.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I let it be known that I was lost in admiration, and so we parted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, since by then it was well past the lunch-hour, I was nearly starving.”“That must have been very trying for you.” My master shows, for the first time, a sympathy to which I have no objection.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For a while there was a pause in the conversation and my purring could be heard by host and guest.Mr.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Beauchamp drains his cup of tea, now quite cold, in one quick gulp and with some formality remarks, “As a matter-of-fact I’ve come today to ask a favor from you.”“Yes?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And what can I do for you?” My master, too, assumes a formal face.“As you know, I am a devotee of literature and art.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“That’s a good thing,” replies my master quite encouragingly.“Since a little while back, I and a few like-minded friends have got together and organized a reading group.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The idea is to meet once a month for the purpose of continued studying in this field.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, we’ve already had the first meeting at the end of last year.”“May I ask you a question?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When you say, like that, a reading group, it suggests that you engage in reading poetry and prose in a singsong tone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But in what sort of manner do you, in fact, proceed?”“Well, we are beginning with ancient works but we intend to consider the works of our fellow members.”“When you speak of ancient works, do you mean something like Po Chu-i’s Lute Song?”“No.”“Perhaps things like Buson’s mixture of haiku and Chinese verse?”“No.”“What kinds of thing do you then do?”“The other day, we did one of Chikamatsu’s lovers’ suicides.”“Chikamatsu?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You mean the Chikamatsu who wrote jōruri plays?”There are not two Chikamatsus.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When one says Chikamatsu, one does indeed mean Chikamatsu the playwright and could mean nobody else.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I thought my master really stupid to ask so fool a question.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, oblivious to my natural reactions, he gently strokes my head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I calmly let him go on stroking me, justifying my compliance with the reflection that so small a weakness is permissible when there are those in the world who admit to thinking themselves under loving observation by persons who merely happen to be cross-eyed.Beauchamp answers, “Yes,” and tries to read the reaction on my master’s face.“Then is it one person who reads or do you allot parts among you?”“We allot parts and each reads out the appropriate dialogue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The idea is to empathize with the characters in the play and, above all, to bring out their individual personalities.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We do gestures as well.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The main thing is to catch the essential character of the era of the play.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, the lines are read out as if spoken by each character, which may perhaps be a young lady or possibly an errand-boy.”“In that case it must be like a play.”“Yes, almost the only things missing are the costumes and the scenery.”“May I ask if your reading was a success?”“For a first attempt, I think one might claim that it was, if anything, a success.”“And which lovers’ suicide play did you perform on the last occasion?”“We did a scene in which a boatman takes a fare to the red light quarter of Yoshiwara.”“You certainly picked on a most irregular incident, didn’t you?” My master, being a teacher, tilts his head a little sideways as if regarding something slightly doubtful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The cigarette smoke drifting from his nose passes up by his ear and along the side of his head.“No, it isn’t that irregular.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The characters are a passenger, a boatman, a high-class prostitute, a serving-girl, an ancient crone of a brothel-attendant, and, of course, a geisha-registrar.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But that’s all.” Beauchamp seems utterly unperturbed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, on hearing the words “a high-class prostitute,” winces slightly but probably only because he’s not well up in the meanings of such technical terms as nakai, yarite, and kemban.He seeks to clear the ground with a question.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Does not nakai signify something like a maid-servant in a brothel?”“Though I have not yet given the matter my full attention, I believe that nakai signifies a serving-girl in a teahouse and that yarite is some sort of an assistant in the women’s quarters.” Although Beauchamp recently claimed that his group seeks to impersonate the actual voices of the characters in the plays, he does not seem to have fully grasped the real nature of yarite and nakai.“I see, nakai belong to a teahouse while yarite live in a brothel.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Next, are kemban human beings or is it the name of a place?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If human, are they men or women?”“Kemban, I rather think, is a male human being.”“What is his function?”“I’ve not yet studied that far.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I’ll make inquiries, one of these days.”Thinking, in the light of these revelations, that the play-readings must be affairs extraordinarily ill-conducted, I glance up at my master’s face.Surprisingly, I find him looking serious.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Apart from yourself, who were the other readers taking part?”“A wide variety of people.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mr. K, a Bachelor of Law, played the high-class prostitute, but his delivery of that woman’s sugary dialogue through his very male mustache did, I confess, create a slightly queer impression.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And then there was a scene in which this oiran was seized with spasms.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Do your readers extend their reading activities to the simulation of spasms?” asked my master anxiously.“Yes indeed; for expression is, after all, important.” Beauchamp clearly considers himself a literary artist à l’outrance.“Did he manage to have his spasms nicely?” My master has made a witty remark.“The spasms were perhaps the only thing beyond our capability at such a first endeavor.” Beauchamp, too, is capable of wit.“By the way,” asks my master, “what part did you take?”“I was the boatman.”“Really?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You, the boatman!” My master’s tone was such as to suggest that, if Beauchamp could be a boatman, he himself could be a geisha-registrar.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Switching his tone to one of simple candor, he then asks: “Was the role of the boatman too much for you?”Beauchamp does not seem particularly offended.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Maintaining the same calm voice, he replies, “As a matter of fact, it was because of this boatman that our precious gathering, though it went up like a rocket, came down like a stick.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It so happened that four or five girl students are living in the boarding house next door to our meeting hall.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I don’t know how, but they found out when our reading was to take place.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, it appears that they came and listened to us under the window of the hall.I was doing the boatman’s voice, and, just when I had warmed up nicely and was really getting into the swing of it—perhaps my gestures were a little over-exaggerated—the girl students, all of whom had managed to control their feelings up to that point, thereupon burst out into simultaneous cachinnations.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was of course surprised, and I was of course embarrassed: indeed, thus dampened, I could not find it in me to continue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So our meeting came to an end.”If this were considered a success, even for a first meeting, what would failure have been like?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I could not help laughing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Involuntarily, my Adam’s apple made a rumbling noise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, who likes what he takes to be purring, strokes my head ever more and more gently.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m thankful to be loved just because I laugh at someone, but at the same time I feel a bit uneasy.“What very bad luck!” My master offers condolences despite the fact that we are still in the congratulatory season of the New Year.“As for our second meeting, we intend to make a great advance and manage things in the grand style.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That, in fact, is the very reason for my call today: we’d like you to join our group and help us.”“I can’t possibly have spasms.” My negative-minded master is already poised to refuse.“No, you don’t have to have spasms or anything like that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Here’s a list of the patron members.” So saying, Beauchamp very carefully produced a small notebook from a purple-colour carrying-wrapper.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He opened the notebook and placed it in front of my master’s knees.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Will you please sign and make your seal-mark here?” I see that the book contains the names of distinguished Doctors of Literature and Bachelors of Arts of this present day, all neatly mustered in full force.“Well, I wouldn’t say I object to becoming a supporter, but what sort of obligations would I have to meet?” My oyster-like master displays his apprehensions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.“There’s hardly any obligation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We ask nothing from you except a signature expressing your approval.”“Well, in that case, I’ll join.” As he realizes that there is no real obligation involved, he suddenly becomes lighthearted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His face assumes the expression of one who would sign even a secret commitment to engage in rebellion, provided it was clear that the signature carried no binding obligation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Besides, it is understandable that he should assent so eagerly: for to be included, even by name only, among so many names of celebrated scholars is a supreme honor for one who has never before had such an opportunity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Excuse me,” and my master goes off to the study to fetch his seal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am tipped to fall unceremoniously onto the matting.Beauchamp helps himself to a slice of sponge cake from the cake-bowl and crams it into his mouth.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For a while he seems to be in pain, mumbling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just for a second I am reminded of my morning experience with the rice-cake.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master reappears with his seal just as the sponge cake settles down in Beauchamp’s bowels.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master does not seem to notice that a piece of sponge cake is missing from the cake-bowl.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he does, I shall be the first to be suspected.Mr.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Beauchamp having taken his departure, my master reenters the study where he finds on his desk a letter from friend Waverhouse.“I wish you a very happy New Year.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”My master considers the letter to have started with an unusual seriousness.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Letters from Waverhouse are seldom serious.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The other day, for instance, he wrote: “Of late, as I am not in love with any woman, I receive no love letters from anywhere.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I am more or less alive, please set your mind at ease.” Compared with which, this New Year’s letter is exceptionally matter-of-fact:I would like to come and see you, but I am so very extremely busy every day because, contrary to your negativism, I am planning to greet this New Year, a year unprecedented in all history, with as positive an attitude as is possible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Hoping you will understand.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".My master quite understands, thinking that Waverhouse, being Waverhouse, must be busy having fun during the New Year season.Yesterday, finding a minute to spare, I sought to treat Mr. Beauchamp to a dish of moat-bells.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unfortunately, due to a shortage of their ingredients, I could not carry out my intention.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was most regrettable.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".My master smiles, thinking that the letter is falling more into the usual pattern.Tomorrow there will be a card party at a certain Baron’s house; the day after tomorrow a New Year’s banquet at the Society of Aesthetes; and the day after that, a welcoming party for Professor Toribe; and on the day thereafter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".My master, finding it rather a bore, skips a few lines.So you see, because of these incessant parties— nō song parties, haiku parties, tanka parties, even parties for New Style Poetry, and so on and so on, I am perpetually occupied for quite some time.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And that is why I am obliged to send you this New Year’s letter instead of calling on you in person.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I pray you will forgive me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".“Of course you do not have to call on me.” My master voices his answer to the letter.Next time that you are kind enough to visit me, I would like you to stay and dine.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though there is no special delicacy in my poor larder, at least I hope to be able to offer you some moat-bells, and I am indeed looking forward to that pleasure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".“He’s still brandishing his moat-bells,” muttered my master, who, thinking the invitation an insult, begins to feel indignant.However, because the ingredients necessary for the preparation of moat-bells are currently in rather short supply, it may not be possible to arrange it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In which case, I will offer you some peacocks’ tongues.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.“Aha!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So he’s got two strings to his bow,” thinks my master and cannot resist reading the rest of the letter.As you know, the tongue meat per peacock amounts to less than half the bulk of the small finger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Therefore, in order to satisfy your gluttonous stomach.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".“What a pack of lies,” remarks my master in a tone of resignation.I think one needs to catch at least twenty or thirty peacocks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, though one sees an occasional peacock, maybe two, at the zoo or at the Asakusa Amusement Center, there are none to be found at my poulterer’s, which is occasioning me pain, great pain.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.“You’re having that pain of your own free will.” My master shows no evidence of gratitude.The dish of peacocks’ tongues was once extremely fashionable in Rome when the Roman Empire was in the full pride of its prosperity.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How I have always secretly coveted after peacocks’ tongues, that acme of gastronomical luxury and elegance, you may well imagine.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".“I may well imagine, may I?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How ridiculous.” My master is extremely cold.From that time forward until about the sixteenth century, peacock was an indispensable delicacy at all banquets.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If my memory serves me, when the Earl of Leicester invited Queen Elizabeth to Kenilworth, peacocks’ tongues were on the menu.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And in one of Rembrandt’s banquet scenes, a peacock is clearly to be seen, lying in its pride upon the table.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".My master grumbles that if Waverhouse can find time to compose a history of the eating of peacocks, he cannot really be so busy.Anyway, if I go on eating good food as I have been doing recently, I will doubtless end up one of these days with a stomach weak as yours.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.“‘Like yours’ is quite unnecessary.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He has no need to establish me as the prototypical dyspeptic,” grumbles my master.According to historians, the Romans held two or three banquets every day.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the consumption of so much good food, while sitting at a large table two or three times a day, must produce in any man, however sturdy his stomach, disorders in the digestive functions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus nature has, like you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".“‘Like you,’ again, what impudence!”But they, who studied long and hard simultaneously to enjoy both luxury and exuberant health, considered it vital not only to devour disproportionately large quantities of delicacies, but also to maintain the bowels in full working order.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They accordingly devised a secret formula.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.“Really?” My master suddenly becomes enthusiastic.They invariably took a post-prandial bath.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After the bath, utilizing methods whose secret has long been lost, they proceeded to vomit up everything they had swallowed before the bath.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Thus were the insides of their stomachs kept scrupulously clean.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having so cleansed their stomachs, they would sit down again at the table and there savor to the uttermost the delicacies of their choice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then they took a bath again and vomited once more.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In this way, though they gorged on their favorite dishes to their hearts’ content, none of their internal organs suffered the least damage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In my humble opinion, this was indeed a case of having one’s cake and eating it.“They certainly seem to have killed two or more birds with one stone.” My master’s expression is one of envy.Today, this twentieth century, quite apart from the heavy traffic and the increased number of banquets, when our nation is in the second year of a war against Russia, is indeed eventful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I, consequently, firmly believe that the time has come for us, the people of this victorious country, to bend our minds to study of the truly Roman art of bathing and vomiting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Otherwise, I am afraid that even the precious people of this mighty nation will, in the very near future, become, like you, dyspeptic.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".“What, again like me?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An annoying fellow,” thinks my master.Now suppose that we, who are familiar with all things Occidental, by study of ancient history and legend contrive to discover the secret formula that has long been lost; then to make use of it now in our Meiji Era would be an act of virtue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would nip potential misfortune in the bud, and, moreover, it would justify my own everyday life which has been one of constant indulgence in pleasure.My master thinks all this a trifle odd.Accordingly, I have now, for some time, been digging into the relevant works of Gibbon, Mommsen, and Goldwin Smith, but I am extremely sorry to report that, so far, I have gained not even the slightest clue to the secret.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, as you know, I am a man who, once set upon a course, will not abandon it until my object is achieved.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Therefore my belief is that a rediscovery of the vomiting method is not far off.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I will let you know when it happens.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Incidentally, I would prefer postponing that feast of moat-bells and peacocks’ tongues, which I’ve mentioned above, until the discovery has actually been made.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which would not only be convenient to me, but also to you who suffer from a weak stomach.“So, he’s been pulling my leg all along.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The style of writing was so sober that I have read it all, and took the whole thing seriously.Waverhouse must indeed be a man of leisure to play such a practical joke on me,” said my master through his laughter.Several days then passed without any particular event.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thinking it too boring to spend one’s time just watching the narcissus in a white vase gradually wither, and the slow blossoming of a branch of the blue-stemmed plum in another vase, I have gone around twice to look for Tortoiseshell, but both times unsuccessfully.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the first occasion I thought she was just out, but on my second visit I learnt that she was ill.Hiding myself behind the aspidistra beside a wash-basin, I heard the following conversation which took place between the mistress and her maid on the other side of the sliding paper-door.“Is Tortoiseshell taking her meal?”“No, madam, she’s eaten nothing this morning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve let her sleep on the quilt of the foot-warmer, well wrapped up.” It does not sound as if they spoke about a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tortoiseshell is being treated as if she were a human.As I compare this situation with my own lot, I feel a little envious but at the same time I am not displeased that my beloved cat should be treated with such kindness.“That’s bad.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If she doesn’t eat she will only get weaker.”“Yes indeed, madam.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even me, if I don’t eat for a whole day, I couldn’t work at all the next day.”The maid answers as though she recognized the cat as an animal superior to herself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, in this particular household the cat may well be more important than the maid.“Have you taken her to see a doctor?”“Yes, and the doctor was really strange.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I went into his consulting room carrying Tortoiseshell in my arms, he asked me if I’d caught a cold and tried to take my pulse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I said ‘No, Doctor, it is not I who am the patient, this is the patient,’ and I placed Tortoiseshell on my knees.The doctor grinned and said he had no knowledge of the sicknesses of cats, and that if I just left it, perhaps it would get better.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Isn’t he too terrible?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was so angry that I told him,‘Then, please don’t bother to examine her, she happens to be our precious cat.’ And I snuggled Tortoiseshell back into the breast of my kimono and came straight home.”“Truly so.”“Truly so” is one of those elegant expressions that one would never hear in my house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One has to be the thirteenth Shogun’s widowed wife’s somebody’s something to be able to use such a phrase.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“No, but you see she’s recently acquired a bad friend.”The maid is as highly elated as if she were telling a State secret.“A bad friend?”“Yes, that tatty-looking tom at the teacher’s house in the main street.”“D’you mean that teacher who makes rude noises every morning?”“Yes, the one who makes the sounds like a goose being strangled every time he washes his face.”The sound of a goose being strangled is a clever description.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every morning when my master gargles in the bathroom he has an odd habit of making a strange, unceremonious noise by tapping his throat with his toothbrush.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he is in a bad temper he croaks with a vengeance; when he is in a good temper, he gets so pepped up that he croaks even more vigorously.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In short, whether he is in a good or a bad temper, he croaks continually and vigorously.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"According to his wife, until they moved to this house he never had the habit; but he’s done it every day since the day he first happened to do it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is rather a trying habit.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We cats cannot even imagine why he should persist in such behavior.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, let that pass.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But what a scathing remark that was about “a tatty-looking tom.” I continue to eavesdrop.“What good can he do making that noise!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Under the Shogunate even a lackey or a sandal-carrier knew how to behave; and in a residential quarter there was no one who washed his face in such a manner.”“I’m sure there wasn’t, madam.”That maid is all too easily influenced, and she uses “madam” far too often.“With a master like that what’s to be expected from his cat?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It can only be a stray.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he comes round here again, beat him.”“Most certainly I’ll beat him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"He is perfectly composed.“Once when someone asked Sanyo whether he’d lately seen any fine pieces of prose, that celebrated scholar of the Chinese classics produced a dunning letter from a packhorse man and said,‘This is easily the finest piece of prose that has recently come to my attention.’ Which implies that your eye for the beautiful might, contrary to one’s expectations, actually be accurate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

But not for nothing has he been so many years a schoolteacher.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is skilled in prevarication, and his long experience in the classrooms can be usefully applied at such awkward moments in his social life.“What is a chopping board at Gyōtoku?” asks the guileless Coldmoon.My master looks toward the alcove and pulverizes that chopping board at Gyōtoku by saying, “Those narcissi are lasting well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I bought them on my way home from the public baths toward the end of last year.”“Which reminds me,” says Waverhouse, twirling his pipe, “that at the end of last year I had a really most extraordinary experience.”“Tell us about it.” My master, confident that the chopping board is now safely back in Gyōtoku, heaves a sigh of relief.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The extraordinary experience of Mr. Waverhouse fell thus upon our ears:“If I remember correctly, it was on the twenty-seventh of December.Beauchamp had said he would like to come and hear me talk upon matters literary, and had asked me to be sure to be in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, I waited for him all the morning but he failed to turn up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I had lunch and was seated in front of the stove reading one of Pain’s humorous books, when a letter arrived from my mother in Shizuoka.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She, like all old women, still thinks of me as a child.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She gives me all sorts of advice; that I mustn’t go out at night when the weather’s cold; that unless the room is first well-heated by a stove, I’ll catch my death of cold every time I take a bath.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We owe much to our parents.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Who but a parent would think of me with such solicitude?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though normally I take things lightly and as they come, I confess that at that juncture the letter affected me deeply.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For it struck me that to idle my life away, as indeed I do, was rather a waste.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I felt that I must win honor for my family by producing a masterwork of literature or something like that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I felt I would like the name of Doctor Waverhouse to become renowned, that I should be acclaimed as a leading figure in Meiji literary circles, while my mother is still alive.Continuing my perusal of the letter, I read,‘You are indeed lucky.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"While our young people are suffering great hardships for the country in the war against Russia, you are living in happy-go-lucky idleness as if life were one long New Year’s party organized for your particular benefit!’Actually, I’m not as idle as my mother thinks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But she then proceeded to list the names of my classmates at elementary school who had either died or had been wounded in the present war.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As, one after another, I read those names, the world grew hollow, all human life quite futile.And she ended her letter by saying, ‘since I am getting old, perhaps this NewYear’s rice-cakes will be my last.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".’ You will understand that, as she wrote so very dishearteningly, I grew more and more depressed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I began to yearn for Beauchamp to come soon, but somehow he didn’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And at last it was time for supper.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I thought of writing in reply to my mother, and I actually wrote about a dozen lines.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My mother’s letter was more than six feet long, but, unable myself to match such a prodigious performance, I usually excuse myself after writing some ten lines.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I had been sitting down for the whole of the day, my stomach felt strange and heavy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thinking that if Beauchamp did turn up he could jolly well wait, I went out for a walk to post my letter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Instead of going toward Fujimicho, which is my usual course, I went, without my knowing it, out toward the third embankment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was a little cloudy that evening and a dry wind was blowing across from the other side of the moat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was terribly cold.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A train coming from the direction of Kagurazaka passed with a whistle along the lower part of the bank.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I felt very lonely.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The end of the year, those deaths on the battlefield, senility, life’s insecurity, that time and tide wait for no man, and other thoughts of a similar nature ran around in my head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One often talks about hanging oneself.But I was beginning to think that one could be tempted to commit suicide just at such a time as this.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It so happened that at that moment I raised my head slightly, and, as I looked up to the top of the bank, I found myself standing right below that very pine tree.”“That very pine tree?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s that?” cuts in my master.“The pine for hanging heads,” says Waverhouse ducking his noddle.“Isn’t the pine for hanging heads that one at Ko-nodai?” Coldmoon amplifies the ripple.“The pine at Kōnodai is the pine for hanging temple bells.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The pine at Dotesambanchō is the one for hanging heads.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The reason why it has acquired this name is that an old legend says that anyone who finds himself under this pine tree is stricken with a desire to hang himself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though there are several dozen pine trees on the bank, every time someone hangs himself, it is invariably on this particular tree that the body is found dangling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I can assure you there are at least two or three such danglings every year.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would be unthinkable to go and dangle on any other pine.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
As I stared at the tree I noted that a branch stuck out conveniently toward the pavement.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Ah!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What an exquisitely fashioned branch.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would be a real pity to leave it as it is.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wish so much that I could arrange for some human body to be suspended there.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I look around to see if anyone is coming.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unfortunately, no one comes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It can’t be helped.Shall I hang myself?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No, no, if I hang myself, I’ll lose my life.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I won’t because it’s dangerous.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But I’ve heard a story that an ancient Greek used to entertain banquet parties by giving demonstrations of how to hang oneself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A man would stand on a stool and the very second that he put his head through a noose, a second man would kick the stool from under him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The trick was that the first man would loosen the knot in the rope just as his stool was kicked away, and so drop down unharmed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If this story is really true, I’ve no need to be frightened.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So thinking I might try the trick myself, I place my hand on the branch and find it bends in a manner precisely appropriate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Indeed the way it bends is positively aesthetic.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel extraordinarily happy as I try to picture myself floating on this branch.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I felt I simply must try it, but then I began to think that it would be inconsiderate if Beauchamp were waiting for me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Right, I would first see Beauchamp and have the chat I’d promised; thereafter I could come out again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So thinking, I went home.”“And is that the happy ending to your story?” asks my master.“Very interesting,” says Coldmoon with a broad grin.“When I got home, Beauchamp had not arrived.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Instead, I found a postcard from him saying that he was sorry he could not keep our appointment because of some pressing but unexpected happening, and that he was looking forward to having a long interview with me in the near future.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was relieved, and I felt happy, for now I could hang myself with an easy mind.Accordingly, I hurry back to the same spot, and then.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".” Waverhouse, assuming a nonchalant air, gazes at Coldmoon and my master.“And then, what happened?” My master is becoming a little impatient.“We’ve now come to the climax,” says Coldmoon as he twists the strings of his surcoat.“And then, somebody had beaten me to it and had already hanged himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m afraid I missed the chance just by a second.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I see now that I had been in the grip of the God of Death.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"William James, that eminent philosopher, would no doubt explain that the region of the dead in the world of one’s subliminal consciousness and the real world in which I actually exist, must have interacted in mutual response in accordance with some kind of law of cause and effect.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But it really was extraordinary, wasn’t it?”Waverhouse looks quite demure.My master, thinking that he has again been taken in, says nothing but crams his mouth with bean-jam cake and mumbles incoherently.Coldmoon carefully rakes smooth the ashes in the brazier and casts down his eyes, grinning; eventually he opens his mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He speaks in an extremely quiet tone.“It is indeed so strange that it does not seem a thing likely to happen.On the other hand, because I myself have recently had a similar kind of experience, I can readily believe it.”“What!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Did you too want to stretch your neck?”“No, mine wasn’t a hanging matter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It seems all the more strange in that it also happened at the end of last year, at about the same time and on the same day as the extraordinary experience of Mr. Waverhouse.”“That’s interesting,” says Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And he, too, stuffs his mouth with bean-jam cake.“On that day, there was a year-end party combined with a concert given at the house of a friend of mine at Mūkōjima.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I went there taking my violin with me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was a grand affair with fifteen or sixteen young or married ladies.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Everything was so perfectly arranged that one felt it was the most brilliant event of recent times.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When the dinner and the concert were over, we sat and talked late, and as I was about to take my leave, the wife of a certain doctor came up to me and asked in whisper if I knew that Miss O was unwell.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A few days earlier, when last I saw Miss O, she had been looking well and normal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So I was surprised to hear this news, and my immediate questions elicited the information that she had become feverish on the very evening of the day when I’d last seen her, and that she was saying all sorts of curious things in her delirium.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What was worse, every now and again in that delirium, she was calling my name.”Not only my master but even Waverhouse refrain from making any such hackneyed remark as “you lucky fellow.”They just listen in silence.“They fetched a doctor who examined her.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"According to the doctor’s diagnosis, though the name of the disease was unknown, the high fever affecting the brain made her condition dangerous unless the administration of soporifics worked as effectively as was to be hoped for.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As soon as I heard this news, a feeling of something awful grew within me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was a heavy feeling, as though one were having a nightmare, and all the surrounding air seemed suddenly to be solidifying like a clamp upon my body.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On my way home, moreover, I found I could think of nothing else, and it hurt.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That beautiful, that gay, that so healthy Miss O. .",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Just a minute, please.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’ve mentioned Miss O about two times.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you’ve no objection, we’d like to know her name wouldn’t we?” asks Waverhouse turning to look at my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The latter evades the question and says, “Hmm.”“No, I won’t tell you her name since it might compromise the person in question.”“Do you then propose to recount your entire story in such vague, ambiguous, equivocal, and noncommittal terms?”“You mustn’t sneer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This is a serious story.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, the thought of that young lady suffering from so odd an ailment filled my heart with mournful emotion, and my mind with sad reflections on the ephemerality of life.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I felt suddenly depressed beyond all saying, as if every last ounce of my vitality had, just like that, evaporated from my body.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I staggered on, tottering and wobbling, until I came to the Azuma Bridge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I looked down, leaning on the parapet, the black waters—at neap or ebb, I don’t know which—seemed to be coagulating, only just barely moving.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A rickshaw coming from the direction of Hanakawado ran over the bridge.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I watched its lamp grow smaller and smaller until it disappeared at the Sapporo Beer factory.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Again, I looked down at the water.And at that moment I heard a voice from upstream calling my name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is most improbable that anyone should be calling after me at this unlikely time of night, and, wondering whom it could possibly be, I peered down to the surface of the water, but I could see nothing in the darkness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thinking it must have been my imagination, I had decided to go home, when I again heard the voice calling my name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I stood dead-still and listened.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I heard it calling me for the third time, though I was gripping the parapet firmly, my knees began to tremble uncontrollably.The voice seemed to be coming either from far away or from the bottom of the river, but it was unmistakably the voice of Miss O.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In spite of myself I answered, ‘Yes.’ My answer was so loud that it echoed back from the still water, and, surprised by my own voice, I looked around me in a startled manner.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There was no one to be seen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No dog.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No moon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nothing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
At this very second I experienced a sudden urge to immerse myself in that total darkness from which the voice had summoned me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And, once again, the voice of Miss O pierced my ears painfully, appealingly, as if begging for help.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This time I cried,‘I’m coming now,’ and, leaning well out over the parapet, I looked down into the somber depths.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For, it seemed to me that the summoning voice was surging powerfully up from beneath the waves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thinking that the source of the pleading must lie in the water directly below me, I at last managed to clamber onto the parapet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was determined that, next time the voice called out to me, I would dive straight in; and, as I stood watching the stream, once again the thin thread of that pitiful voice came floating up to me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This, I thought, is it; jumping high with all my strength, I came dropping down without regret like a pebble, or something.”“So, you actually did dive in?” asks my master, blinking his eyes.“I never thought you’d go as far as that,” says Waverhouse pinching the tip of his nose.“After my dive I became unconscious, and for a while I seemed to be living in a dream.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But eventually I woke up, and, though I felt cold, I was not at all wet and did not feel as if I had swallowed any water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Yet I was sure that I had dived.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How very strange!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Realizing that something peculiar must have taken place, I looked around me and received a real shock.I’d meant to dive into the water but apparently I’d accidentally landed in the middle of the bridge itself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I felt abysmally regretful.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having, by sheer mistake, jumped backwards instead of forwards, I’d lost my chance to answer the summons of the voice.” Coldmoon smirks and fiddles with the strings of his surcoat as if they were in some way irksome.“Ha-ha-ha, how very comical.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s odd that your experience so much resembles mine.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It, too, could be adduced in support of the theories of Professor James.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you were to write it up in an article entitled ‘The Human Response,’ it would astound the whole literary world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But what,” persisted Waverhouse, “became of the ailing Miss O?”“When I called at her house a few days ago, I saw her just inside the gate playing battledore and shuttlecock with her maid.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So I expect she has completely recovered from her illness.”My master, who for some time has been deep in thought, finally opens his mouth, and, in a spirit of unnecessary rivalry, remarks, “I too have a strange experience to relate.”“You’ve got what?” In Waverhouse’s view, my master counts for so little that he is scarcely entitled to have experiences.“Mine also occurred at the end of last year.”“It’s queer,” observed Coldmoon, “that all last year,” and he sniggers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A piece of bean-jam cake adheres to the corner of his chipped front tooth.“And it took place, doubtless,” added Waverhouse, “at the very same time on the very same day.”“No, I think the date is different: it was about the 20th.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My wife had earlier asked me, as a year’s-end present to herself, to take her to hear Settsu Daijō.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d replied that I wouldn’t say no, and asked her the nature of the program for that day.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She consulted the newspapers and answered that it was one of Chikamatsu’s suicide dramas, Unagidani.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘Let’s not go today, I don’t like Unagidani,’ said I.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So we did not go that day.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The next day my wife, bringing out the newspaper again, said, ‘Today he’s doing the Monkey Man at Horikawa, so, let’s go.’ I said let’s not, because Horikawa was so frivolous, just samisen-playing with no meat in it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My wife went away looking discontented.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The following day, she stated almost as a demand, ‘Today’s program is The Temple With Thirty-Three Pillars.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You may dislike the Temple quite as strongly as you disliked all the others, but since the treat is intended to be for me, surely you won’t object to taking me there.’ I responded,‘If you’ve set your heart on it so firmly, then we’ll go, but since the performance has been announced as Settsu’s farewell appearance on the stage, the house is bound to be packed full, and since we haven’t booked in advance, it will obviously be impossible to get in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To start with, in order to attend such performances there’s an established procedure to be observed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You have to go to the theatre-teahouse and there negotiate for seat reservations.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would be hopeless to try going about it in the wrong way.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You just can’t dodge this proper procedure.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, sorry though I am, we simply cannot go today.’My wife’s eyes glittered fiercely.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘Since I am a mere woman, I do not understand your complicated procedures, but both Ohare’s mother and Kimiyo of the Suzuki family managed to get in without observance of any such formalities, and they heard everything very well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I realize that you are a teacher, but surely you don’t have to go through all that troublesome rigmarole just to visit a theatre?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s too bad.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
you are so.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.’ and her voice became tearful.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I gave in.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
‘All right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We’ll go to the theatre even if we can’t get into it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
After an early supper we’ll take the tram.’ She suddenly became quite lively.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘If we’re going, we must be there by four o’clock, so we mustn’t dilly-dally.’When I asked her why one had to be there by four o’clock, she explained that Kimiyo had told her that, if one arrived any later, all the seats would be taken.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I asked her again, to make quite sure, if it would be fruitless to turn up later than four o’clock; and she answered briskly,‘Of course it would be no good.’Then, d’you know, at that very moment the shivering set in.”“Do you mean your wife?” asks Coldmoon.“Oh, no, my wife was as fit as a fiddle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I had a sudden feeling that I was shriveling like a pricked balloon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then I grew giddy and unable even to move.”“You were taken ill with a most remarkable suddenness,” commented Waverhouse.“This is terrible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What shall I do?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d like so much to grant my wife her wish, her one and only request in the whole long year.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All I ever do is scold her fiercely, or not speak to her, or nag her about household expenses, or insist that she cares more carefully for the children; yet I have never rewarded her for all her efforts in the domestic field.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Today, luckily, I have the time and the money available.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I could easily take her on some little outing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And she very much wants to go.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just as I very much want to take her.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But much indeed as I want to take her, this icy shivering and frightful giddiness make it impossible for me even to step down from the entrance of my own house, let alone to climb up into a tram.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The more I think how deeply I grieve for her, the poor thing, the worse my shivering grows and the more giddy I become.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I thought if I consulted a doctor and took some medicine, I might get well before four o’clock.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I discussed the matter with my wife and sent for Mr. Amaki, Bachelor of Medicine.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unfortunately, he had been on night duty at the university hospital and hadn’t yet come home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, we received every assurance that he was expected home by about two o’clock and that he would hurry round to see me the minute he returned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a nuisance.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If only I could get some sedative, I know I could be cured before four.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when luck is running against one, nothing goes well.Here I am, just this once in a long, long time, looking forward to seeing my wife’s happy smile, and to be sharing in that happiness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My expectations seem sadly unlikely to be fulfilled.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My wife, with a most reproachful look, enquires whether it really is impossible for me to go out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
‘I’ll go; certainly I’ll go.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t worry.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m sure I’ll be all right by four.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Wash your face, get ready to go out and wait for me.’ Though I uttered all these reassurance, my mind was shaken with profound emotions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The shivering strengthens and accelerates, and my giddiness grows worse and worse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unless I do get well by four o’clock and implement my promise, one can never tell what such a pusillanimous woman might do.What a wretched business.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What should I do?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I thought it possible that the very worst could happen, I began to consider whether perhaps it might be my duty as a husband to explain to my wife, now while I was still in possession of my faculties, the dread truths concerning mortality and the vicissitudes of life.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For if the worst should happen, she would then at least be prepared and less liable to be overcome by the paroxysms of her grief.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I accordingly summoned my wife to come immediately to my study.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when I began by saying,‘Though but a woman you must be aware of that Western proverb which states that there is many a slip “twixt the cup and the lip,”’ she flew into a fury.‘How should I know anything at all about such sideways-written words?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’re deliberately making a fool of me by choosing to speak English when you know perfectly well that I don’t understand a word of it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So I can’t understand English.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if you’re so besotted about English, why didn’t you marry one of those girls from the mission schools?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve never come across anyone quite so cruel as you.’ In the face of this tirade, my kindly feelings, my husbandly anxiety to prepare her for extremities, were naturally damped down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’d like you two to understand that it was not out of malice that I spoke in English.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The words sprang solely from a sincere sentiment of love for my wife.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, my wife’s malign interpretation of my motives left me feeling helpless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Besides, my brain was somewhat disturbed by reason of the cold shivering and the giddiness; on top of all that, I was understandably distraught by the effort of trying quickly to explain to her the truths of mortality and the nature of the vicissitudes of life.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That was why, quite unconsciously and forgetting that my wife could not understand the tongue, I spoke in English.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I immediately realized I was in the wrong.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was all entirely my fault.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But as a result of my blunder, the cold shivering intensified its violence and my giddiness grew ever more viciously vertiginous.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My wife, in accordance with my instructions, proceeds to the bathroom and, stripping herself to the waist, completes her make-up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, taking a kimono from a drawer, she puts it on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her attitudes make it quite clear that she is now ready to go out any time, and is simply waiting for me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I begin to get nervous.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Wishing that Mr. Amaki would arrive quickly, I look at my watch.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s already three o’clock.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only one hour to go.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My wife slides open the study door and putting her head in, asks, ‘Shall we go now?’ It may sound silly to praise one’s own wife, but I had never thought her quite so beautiful as she was at that moment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her skin, thoroughly polished with soap, gleams deliciously and makes a marvelous contrast with the blackness of her silken surcoat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Her face has a kind of radiance both externally and shining from within; partly because of the soap and partly because of her intense longing to listen to Settsu Daijō.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I feel I must, come what may, take her out to satisfy that yearning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All right, perhaps I will make the awful effort to go out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was smoking and thinking along these lines when at long last Mr. Amaki arrived.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Excellent.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Things are turning out as one would wish.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, when I told him about my condition,Amaki examined my tongue, took my pulse, tapped my chest, stroked my back, turned my eyelids inside out, patted my skull, and thereafter sank into deep thought for quite some time.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I said to him, ‘It is my impression that there may be some danger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".’ but he replied,‘No, I don’t think there’s anything seriously wrong.’ ‘I imagine it would be perfectly all right for him to go out for a little while?’ asked my wife.‘Let me think.’ Amaki sank back into the profundities of thought, reemerging to remark,‘Well, so long as he doesn’t feel unwell.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".’‘Oh, but I do feel unwell,’ I said.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In that case I’ll give you a mild sedative and some liquid medicine.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.’‘Yes please.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This is going to be something serious, isn’t it?’ ‘Oh no, there’s nothing to worry about.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You mustn’t get nervous,’ said Amaki, and thereupon departed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is now half past three.The maid was sent to fetch the medicine.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In accordance with my wife’s imperative instructions, the wretched girl not only ran the whole way there, but also the whole way back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is now a quarter to four.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Fifteen minutes still to go.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, quite suddenly, just about that time, I began to feel sick.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It came on with a quite extraordinary suddenness.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All totally unexpected.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My wife had poured the medicine into a teacup and placed it in front of me, but as soon as I tried to lift the teacup, some keck-keck thing stormed up from within the stomach.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am compelled to put the teacup down.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
‘Drink it up quickly’ urges my wife.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yes, indeed, I must drink it quickly and go out quickly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mustering all my courage to imbibe the potion I bring the teacup to my lips, when again that insuppressible keck-keck thing prevents my drinking it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"While this process of raising the cup and putting it down is being several times repeated, the minutes crept on until the wall clock in the living room struck four o’clock.Ting-ting-ting-ting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Four o’clock it is.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I can no longer dilly-dally and I raise the teacup once again.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"D’you know, it really was most strange.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’d say that it was certainly the uncanniest thing I’ve ever experienced.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At the fourth stroke my sickliness just vanished, and I was able to take the medicine without any trouble at all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And, by about ten past four—here I must add that I now realized for the first time how truly skilled a physician we have in Dr. Amaki—the shivering of my back and the giddiness in my head both disappeared like a dream.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Up to that point I had expected that I was bound to be laid up for days, but to my great pleasure the illness proved to have been completely cured.”“And did you two then go out to the theatre?” asks Waverhouse with the puzzled expression of one who cannot see the point of a story.“We certainly both wanted to go, but since it had been my wife’s reiterated view that there was no hope of getting in after four o’clock, what could we do?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We didn’t go.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If only Amaki had arrived fifteen minutes earlier, I could have kept my promise and my wife would have been satisfied.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just that fifteen minute difference.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was indeed distressed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even now, when I think how narrow the margin was, I am again distressed.”My master, having told his shabby tale, contrives to look like a person who has done his duty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I imagine he feels he’s gotten even with the other two.“How very vexing,” says Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His laugh, as usual, displays his broken tooth.Waverhouse, with a false naivety, remarks as if to himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Your wife, with a husband so thoughtful and kind-hearted, is indeed a lucky woman.” Behind the sliding paper-door, we heard the master’s wife make an harumphing noise as though clearing her throat.I had been quietly listening to the successive stories of these three precious humans, but I was neither amused nor saddened by what I’d heard.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I merely concluded that human beings were good for nothing, except for the strenuous employment of their mouths for the purpose of whiling away their time in laughter at things which are not funny, and in the enjoyment of amusements which are not amusing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have long known of my master’s selfishness and narrowmindedness, but, because he usually has little to say, there was always something about him which I could not understand.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d felt a certain caution, a certain fear, even a certain respect toward him on account of that aspect of his nature that I did not understand.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But having heard his story, my uncertainties suddenly coalesced into a mere contempt for him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Why can’t he listen to the stories of the other two in silence?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What good purpose can he serve by talking such utter rubbish just because his competitive spirit has been roused?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I wonder if, in his portentous writings, Epictetus advocated any such course of action.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In short, my master,Waverhouse, and Coldmoon are all like hermits in a peaceful reign.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though they adopt a nonchalant attitude, keeping themselves aloof from the crowd, segegrated like so many snake-gourds swayed lightly by the wind, in reality they, too, are shaken by just the same greed and worldly ambition as their fellow men.The urge to compete and their anxiety to win are revealed flickeringly in their everyday conversation, and only a hair’s breadth separates them from the Philistines whom they spend their idle days denouncing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They are all animals from the same den.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which fact, from a feline viewpoint, is infinitely regrettable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Their only moderately redeeming feature is that their speech and conduct are less tediously uninventive than those of less subtle creatures.As I thus summed up the nature of the human race, I suddenly felt the conversation of these specimens to be intolerably boring, so I went around to the garden of the mistress of the two-stringed harp to see how Tortoiseshell was getting on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Already the pine tree decorations for the New Year and that season’s sacred festoons have been taken down.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is the 10th of January.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From a deep sky containing not even a single streak of cloud the glorious springtime sun shines down upon the lands and seas of the whole wide world, so that even her tiny garden seems yet more brilliantly lively than when it saw the dawn of New Year’s Day.There is a cushion on the veranda, the sliding paper-door is closed, and there’s nobody about.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which probably means that the mistress has gone off to the public baths.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m not at all concerned if the mistress should be out, but I do very much worry about whether Tortoiseshell is any better.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since everything’s so quiet and not a sign of a soul, I hop up onto the veranda with my muddy paws and curl up right in the middle of the cushion, which I find comfortable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A drowsiness came over me, and, forgetting all about Tortoiseshell, I was about to drop off into a doze when suddenly I heard voices beyond the paper-door.“Ah, thanks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Was it ready?”The mistress has not gone out after all.“Yes, madam.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m sorry to have taken such a long time.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I got there, the man who makes Buddhist altar furniture told me he’d only just finished it.”“Well, let me see it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ah, but it’s beautifully done.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With this, Tortoiseshell can surely rest in peace.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Are you sure the gold won’t peel away?”“Yes, I’ve made sure of it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They said that as they had used the very best quality, it would last longer than most human memorial tablets.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They also said that the character for ‘honor’ in Tortoiseshell’s posthumous name would look better if written in the cursive style, so they had added the appropriate strokes.”“Is that so?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, let’s put Myōyoshinnyo’s tablet in the family shrine and offer incense sticks.”Has anything happened to Tortoiseshell?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thinking something must be wrong, I stand up on the cushion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Ting!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Amen!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Myōyoshinnyo.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Save us, merciful Buddha!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"May she rest in peace.” It is the voice of the mistress.“You, too, say prayers for her.”Ting!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Amen!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Myōyoshinnyo.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Save us, merciful Buddha!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
May she rest in peace.” Suddenly my heart throbs violently.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I stand dead-still upon the cushion, like a wooden cat; not even my eyes are moving.“It really was a pity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was only a cold at first.”“Perhaps if Dr. Amaki had given her some medicine, it might have helped.”“It was indeed Amaki’s fault.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He paid too little regard to Tortoiseshell.”“You must not speak ill of other persons.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After all, everyone dies when their allotted span is over.”It seems thatTortoiseshell was also attended by that skilled physician, Dr. Amaki.“When all’s said and done, I believe the root cause was that the stray cat at the teacher’s in the main street took her out too often.”“Yes, that brute.”I would like to exculpate myself, but realizing that at this juncture it behoves me to be patient, I swallow hard and continue listening.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There is a pause in the conversation.“Life does not always turn out as one wishes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A beauty like Tortoiseshell dies young.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That ugly stray remains healthy and flourishes in devilment.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“It is indeed so, Madam.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even if one searched high and low for a cat as charming as Tortoiseshell, one would never find another person like her.”She didn’t say ‘another cat,’ she said ‘another person.’The maid seems to think that cats and human beings are of one race.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which reminds me that the face of this particular maid is strangely like a cat’s.“If only instead of our dear Tortoiseshell.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
that wretched stray at the teacher’s had been taken.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, Madam, how perfectly everything would have gone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”If everything had gone that perfectly, I would have been in deep trouble.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since I have not yet had the experience of being dead, I cannot say whether or not I would like it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the other day, it happening to be unpleasantly chilly, I crept into the tub for conserving half-used charcoal and settled down upon its still-warm contents.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The maid, not realizing I was in there, popped on the lid.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I shudder even now at the mere thought of the agony I then suffered.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"According to Miss Blanche, the cat across the road, one dies if that agony continues for even a very short stretch.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I wouldn’t complain if I were asked to substitute for Tortoiseshell; but if one cannot die without going through that kind of agony, I frankly would not care to die on anyone’s behalf.“Though a cat, she had her funeral service conducted by a priest and now she’s been given a posthumous Buddhist name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I don’t think she would expect us to do more.”“Of course not, madam.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She is indeed thrice blessed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The only comment that one might make is that the funeral service read by the priest was, perhaps, a little wanting in gravity.”“Yes, and I thought it rather too brief.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when I remarked to the priest from the Gekkei Temple ‘you’ve finished very quickly, haven’t you?’ he answered ‘I’ve done sufficient of the effective parts, quite enough to get a kitty into Paradise.’”“Dear me!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But if the cat in question were that unpleasant stray.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”I have pointed out often enough that I have no name, but this maid keeps calling me “that stray.” She is a vulgar creature.“So very sinful a creature.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Madam, would never be able to rest in peace, however many edifying texts were read for its salvation.”I do not know how many hundreds of times I was thereafter stigmatized as a stray.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I stopped listening to their endless babble while it was still only half-run, and, slipping down from the cushion, I jumped off the veranda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then,simultaneously erecting every single one of my eighty-eight thousand, eight hundred, eighty hairs, I shook my whole body.Since that day I have not ventured near the mistress of the two-stringed harp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No doubt by now she herself is having texts of inadequate gravity read on her behalf by the priest from the Gekkei Temple.Nowadays I haven’t even energy to go out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Somehow life seems weary.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I have become as indolent a cat as my master is an indolent human.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have come to understand that it is only natural that people should so often explain my master’s self-immurement in his study as the result of a love affair gone wrong.As I have never caught a rat, that O-san person once proposed that I should be expelled; but my master knows that I’m no ordinary common or garden cat, and that is why I continue to lead an idle existence in this house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For that understanding I am deeply grateful to my master.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s more, I take every opportunity to show the respect due to his perspicacity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I do not get particularly angry with O-san’s ill-treatment of me, for she does not understand why I am as I now am.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when, one of these days, some master sculptor, some regular Hidari Jingorō, comes and carves my image on a temple gate; when some Japanese equivalent of the French master portraitist, Steinlein, immortalizes my features on a canvas, then at last will the silly purblind beings in shame regret their lack of insight.IIITORTOISESHELL is dead,one cannot consort with Rickshaw Blacky, and I feel a little lonely.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Luckily I have made acquaintances among humankind so I do not suffer from any real sense of boredom.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Someone wrote recently asking my master to have my photograph taken and the picture sent to him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And then the other day somebody else presented some millet dumplings, that speciality of Okayama, specifically addressed to me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The more that humans show me sympathy, the more I am inclined to forget that I am a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Feeling that I am now closer to humans than to cats, the idea of rallying my own race in an effort to wrest supremacy from the bipeds no longer has the least appeal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Moreover, I have developed, indeed evolved, to such an extent that there are now times when I think of myself as just another human in the human world; which I find very encouraging.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is not that I look down on my own race, but it is no more than natural to feel most at ease among those whose attitudes are similar to one’s own.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I would consequently feel somewhat piqued if my growing penchant for mankind were stigmatized as fickleness or flippancy or treachery.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is precisely those who sling such words about in slanderous attacks on others who are usually both drearily straight-laced and born unlucky.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having thus graduated from felinity to humanity, I find myself no longer able to confine my interests to the world of Tortoiseshell and Blacky.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With a haughtiness not less prideful than that of human beings, I, too, now like to judge and criticize their thoughts and words and deeds.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This, surely, is equally natural.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet, though I have become thus proudly conscious of my own dignity, my master still regards me as a cat only slightly superior to any other common or garden moggy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For, as if they were his own and without so much as a by-your-leave to me, he has eaten all the millet dumplings; which is, I find, regrettable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nor does he seem yet to have dispatched my photograph.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I suppose I would be justified if I made this fact a cause for grumbling, but after all, if our opinions—my master’s and mine—are naturally at difference, the consequences of that difference cannot be helped.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since I am seeking to behave with total humanity, I’m finding it increasingly difficult to write about the activities of cats with whom I no longer associate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I must accordingly seek the indulgence of my readers if I now confine my writing to reports about such respected figures as Waverhouse and Coldmoon.Today is a Sunday and the weather fine.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The master has therefore crept out of his study, and, placing a brush, an ink stone, and a writing pad in a row before him, he now lies flat on his belly beside me, and is groaning hard.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I watch him, thinking that he is perhaps making this peculiar noise in the birth pangs of some literary effort.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After a while, and in thick black strokes, he wrote, “Burn incense.” Is it going to be a poem or a haiku?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just when I was thinking that the phrase was rather too witty for my master, he abandons it, and, his brush running quickly over the paper, writes an entirely new line: “Now for some little time I have been thinking of writing an article about Mr. the-late-and-sainted Natural Man.” At this point the brush stops dead.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, brush in hand, racks his brains, but no bright notions seem to emerge for he now starts licking the head of his brush.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I watched his lips acquire a curious inkiness.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, underneath what he had just written, he drew a circle, put in two dots as eyes, added a nostrilled nose in the center, and finally drew a single sideways line for a mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One could not call such creations either haiku or prose.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even my master must have been disgusted with himself, for he quickly smeared away the face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He then starts a new line.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He seems to have some vague notion that, provided he himself produces a new line, maybe some kind of a Chinese poem will evolve itself.After further moonings, he suddenly started writing briskly in the colloquial style.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Mr.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"the-late-and-sainted Natural Man is one who studies Infinity, reads the Analects of Confucius, eats baked yams, and has a runny nose.” A somewhat muddled phrase.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He thereupon read the phrase aloud in a declamatory manner and, quite unlike his usual self, laughed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Ha-ha-ha.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Interesting!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But that ‘runny nose’ is a shade cruel, so I’ll cross it out,” and he proceeds to draw lines across that phrase.“Though a single line would clearly have sufficed, he draws two lines and then three lines.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He goes on drawing more and more lines regardless of their crowding into the neighboring line of writing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he has drawn eight such obliterations, he seems unable to think of anything to add to his opening outburst.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So he takes to twirling his mustache, determined to wring some telling sentence from his whiskers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is still twisting them up and twirling them down when his wife appears from the living room, and sitting herself down immediately before my master’s nose, remarks, “My dear.”“What is it?” My master’s voice sounds dully like a gong struck under water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His wife seems not to like the answer, for she starts all over again.“My dear!” she says.“Well, what is it?”This time, cramming a thumb and index finger into a nostril, he yanks out nostril hairs.“We are a bit short this month.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Couldn’t possibly be short.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We’ve settled the doctor’s fee and we paid off the bookshop’s bill last month.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So this month, there ought in fact to be something left over.” He coolly examines his uprooted nostril hairs as though they were some wonder of the world.“But because you, instead of eating rice, have taken to bread and jam.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Well, how many tins of jam have I gone through?”“This month, eight tins were emptied.”“Eight?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I certainly haven’t eaten that much.”“It wasn’t only you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The children also lick it.”“However much one licks, one couldn’t lick more than two or three shillings worth.” My master calmly plants his nostril hairs, one by one, on the writing pad.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The sticky-rooted bristles stand upright on the paper like a little copse of needles.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master seems impressed by this unexpected discovery and he blows upon them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being so sticky, they do not fly away.“Aren’t they obstinate?” he says and blows upon them frantically.“It is not only the jam.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s other things we have to buy.” The lady of the house expresses her extreme dissatisfaction by pouting sulkily.“Maybe.” Again inserting his thumb and finger, he extracts some hairs with a jerk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Among these hairs of various hue, red ones and black ones, there is a single pure white bristle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master who, with a look of great surprise, has been staring at this object, proceeds to show it to his wife, holding it up between his fingers right in front of her face.“No, don’t.” She pushes his hand away with a grimace of distaste.“Look at it!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A white hair from the nostrils.” My master seems to be immensely impressed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His wife, resigned, went back into the living room with a laugh.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She seems to have given up hope of getting any answer to her problems of domestic economy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master resumes his consideration of the problems of Natural Man.Having succeeded in driving off his wife with his scourge of nostril hair, he appears to feel relieved, and, while continuing that depilation, struggles to get on with his article.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But his brush remains unmoving.“That ‘eats baked yams’ is also superfluous.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Out with it.” He deletes the phrase.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“And ‘incense burns’ is somewhat over-abrupt, so let’s cross that out too.” His exuberant self-criticism leaves nothing on the paper but the single sentence “Mr.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
the-late-and-sainted Natural Man is one who studies Infinity and reads the Analects of Confucius.” My master thinks this statement a trifle over-simplified.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Ah well, let’s not be bothered: let’s abandon prose and just make it an inscription.” Brandishing the brush crosswise, he paints vigorously on the writing pad in that watercolor style so common among literary men and produces a very poor study of an orchid.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Thus all his precious efforts to write an article have come down to this mere nothing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Turning the sheet, he writes something that makes no sense.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Born in Infinity, studied Infinity, and died into Infinity.Mr.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

Infinity.” At this moment Waverhouse drifts into the room in his usual casual fashion.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He appears to make no distinction between his own and other people’s houses; unannounced and unceremoniously, he enters any house and, what’s more, will sometimes float in unexpectedly through a kitchen door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is one of those who, from the moment of their birth, discaul themselves of all such tiresome things as worry, reserve, scruple, and concern.“‘Giant Gravitation again?’” asks Waverhouse still standing.“How could I be always writing only about ‘Giant Gravitation?’ I’m trying to compose an epitaph for the tombstone of Mr. the-late-and-sainted Natural Man,” replied my master with considerable exaggeration.“Is that some sort of posthumous Buddhist name like Accidental Child?” inquires Waverhouse in his usual irrelevant style.“Is there then someone called Accidental Child?”“No, of course there isn’t, but I take it that you’re working on something like that.”“I don’t think Accidental Child is anyone I know.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But Mr. the-late-and-sainted Natural Man is a person of your own acquaintance.”“Who on earth could get a name like that?”“It’s Sorosaki.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After he graduated from the University, he took a post-graduate course involving study of the ‘theory of infinity.’ But he over-worked, got peritonitis, and died of it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sorosaki happened to be a very close friend of mine.”“All right, so he was your very close friend.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m far from criticizing that fact.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But who was responsible for converting Sorosaki into Mr. the-late-and-sainted Natural Man?”“Me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I created that name.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For there is really nothing more philistine than the posthumous names conferred by Buddhist priests.” My master boasts as if his nomination of Natural Man were a feat of artistry.“Anyway, let’s see the epitaph,” says Waverhouse laughingly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He picks up my master’s manuscript and reads it out aloud.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

This is fine.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quite appropriate for poor old Sorosaki.”“Good, isn’t it?” says my master obviously very pleased.“You should have this epitaph engraved on a weight-stone for pickles and then leave it at the back of the main hall of some temple for the practice-benefit of passing weight lifters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s good.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s most artistic.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mr. the-late-and-sainted may now well rest in peace.”“Actually, I’m thinking of doing just that,” answers my master quite seriously.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“But you’ll have to excuse me,” he went on, “I won’t be long.Just play with the cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Don’t go away.” And my master departed like the wind without even waiting for Waverhouse to answer.Being thus unexpectedly required to entertain the culture-vulture Waverhouse, I cannot very well maintain my sour attitude.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, I mew at him encouragingly and sidle up on to his knees.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Hello,” says Waverhouse, “you’ve grown distinctly chubby.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let’s take a look at you.”Grabbing me impolitely by the scruff of my neck he hangs me up in midair.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Cats like you that let their hind legs dangle are cats that catch no mice.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tell me,” he said, turning to my master’s wife in the next room, “has he ever caught anything?”“Far from catching so much as a single mouse, he eats rice-cakes and then dances.” The lady of the house unexpectedly probes my old wound, which embarrassed me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Especially when Waverhouse still held me in midair like a circus-performer.“Indeed, with such a face, it’s not surprising that he dances.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Do you know, this cat possesses a truly insidious physionomy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He looks like one of those goblin-cats illustrated in the old storybooks.” Waverhouse, babbling whatever comes into his head, tries to make conversation with the mistress.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She reluctantly interrupts her sewing and comes into the room.“I do apologize.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You must be bored.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He won’t be long now.” And she poured fresh tea for him.“I wonder where he’s gone.”“Heaven only knows.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He never explains where he’s going.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Probably to see his doctor.”“You mean Dr. Amaki?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What a misfortune for Amaki to be involved with such a patient.”Perhaps finding this comment difficult to answer, she answers briefly:“Well, yes.”Waverhouse takes not the slightest notice, but goes on to ask, “How is he lately?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is his weak stomach any better?”“It’s impossible to say whether it’s better or worse.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However carefully Dr. Amaki may look after him, I don’t see how his health can ever improve if he continues to consume such vast quantities of jam.” She thus works off on Waverhouse her earlier grumblings to my master.“Does he eat all that much jam?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It sounds like a child.”“And not just jam.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s recently taken to guzzling grated radish on the grounds that it’s a sovereign cure for dyspepsia.”“You surprise me,” marvels Waverhouse.“It all began when he read in some rag that grated radish contains diastase.”“I see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I suppose he reckons that grated radish will repair the ravages of jam.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s certainly an ingenious equation.” Waverhouse seems vastly diverted by her recital of complaint.“Then only the other day he forced some on the baby.”“He made the baby eat jam?”“No, grated radish!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Would you believe it?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He said, ‘Come here, my little babykin, father’ll give you something good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".’Whenever, once in a rare while, he shows affection for the children, he always does remarkably silly things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A few days ago he put our second daughter on top of a chest of drawers.”“What ingenious scheme was that?” Waverhouse looks to discover ingenuities in everything.“There was no question of any ingenious scheme.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He just wanted the child to make the jump when it’s quite obvious that a little girl of three or four is incapable of such tomboy feats.”“I see.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yes, that proposal does indeed seem somewhat lacking in ingenuity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Still, he’s a good man without an ill wish in his heart.”“Do you think that I could bear it if, on top of everything else, he were ill-natured?” She seems in uncommonly high spirits.“Surely you don’t have cause for such vehement complaint?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To be as comfortably off as you are is, after all, the best way to be.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Your husband neither leads the fast life nor squanders money on dandified clothing.He’s a born family man of quiet taste.”Waverhouse fairly lets himself go in unaccustomed laud of an unknown way of life.“On the contrary, he’s not at all like that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Indeed?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So he has secret vices?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, one cannot be too careful in this world.” Waverhouse offers a nonchalantly fluffy comment.“He has no secret vices, but he is totally abandoned in the way he buys book after book, never to read a single one.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I wouldn’t mind if he used his head and bought in moderation, but no.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whenever the mood takes him, he ambles off to the biggest bookshop in the city and brings back home as many books as chance to catch his fancy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, at the end of the month, he adopts an attitude of complete detachment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At the end of last year, for instance, I had a terrible time coping with the bill that had been accumulating month after month.”“It doesn’t matter that he should bring home however many books he may like.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If, when the bill collector comes, you just say that you’ll pay some other time, he’ll go away.”“But one cannot put things off indefinitely.” She looks cast down.“Then you should explain the matter to your husband and ask him to cut down expenditure on books.”“And do you really believe he would listen to me?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why, only the other day, he said,‘You are so unlike a scholar’s wife: you lack the least understanding of the value of books.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Listen carefully to this story from ancient Rome.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It will give you beneficial guidance for your future conduct.’”“That sounds interesting.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What sort of story was it?” Waverhouse becomes enthusiastic, though he appears less sympathetic to her predicament than prompted by sheer curiosity.“It seems there was in ancient Rome a king named Tarukin.”“Tarukin?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That sounds odd in Japanese.”“I can never remember the names of foreigners.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s all too difficult.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Maybe he was a barrel of gold.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He was, at any rate, the seventh king of Rome.”“Really?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The seventh barrel of gold certainly sounds queer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, tell me, what then happened to this seventh Tarukin.”“You mustn’t tease me like that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You quite embarrass me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you know this king’s true name, you should teach me it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Your attitude,” she snaps at him, “is really most unkind.”“I tease you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wouldn’t dream of doing such an unkind thing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was simply that the seventh barrel of gold sounded so wonderful.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"I can’t be absolutely certain but I rather think it must have been Tarquinius Superbus,Tarquin the Proud.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, it doesn’t really matter who it was.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What did this monarch do?”“I understand that some woman, Sibyl by name, went to this king with nine books and invited him to buy them.”“I see.”“When the king asked her how much she wanted, she stated a very high price, so high that the king asked for a modest reduction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whereupon the woman threw three of the nine books into the fire where they were quickly burnt to ashes.”“What a pity!”“The books were said to contain prophecies, predictions, things like that of which there was no other record anywhere.”“Really?”“The king, believing that six books were bound to be cheaper than nine, asked the price of the remaining volumes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The price proved to be exactly the same; not one penny less.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When the king complained of this outrageous development, the women threw another three books into the fire.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The king apparently still hankered for the books and he accordingly asked the price of the last three left.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The woman again demanded the same price as she had asked for the original nine.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nine books had shrunk to six, and then to three, but the price remained unaltered even by a farthing.Suspecting that any attempt to bargain would merely lead the woman to pitch the last three volumes into the flames, the king bought them at the original staggering price.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My husband appeared confident that, having heard this story, I would begin to appreciate the value of books, but I don’t at all see what it is that I’m supposed to have learnt to appreciate.”Having thus stated her own position, she as good as challenges Waverhouse to contravert her.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even the resourceful Waverhouse seems to be at a loss.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He draws a handkerchief from the sleeve of his kimono and tempts me to play with it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, in a loud voice as if an idea had suddenly struck him, he remarked, “But you know, Mrs. Sneaze, it is precisely because your husband buys so many books and fills his head with wild notions that he is occasionally mentioned as a scholar, or something of that sort.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only the other day a comment on your husband appeared in a literary magazine.”“Really?” She turns around.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After all, it’s only natural that his wife should feel anxiety about comments on my master.“What did it say?”“Oh, only a few lines.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It said that Mr. Sneaze’s prose was like a cloud that passes in the sky, like water flowing in a stream.”“Is that,” she asks smiling, “all that it said?”“Well, it also said ‘it vanishes as soon as it appears and, when it vanishes, it is forever forgetful to return.’”The lady of the house looks puzzled and asks anxiously “Was that praise?”“Well, yes, praise of a sort,” says Waverhouse coolly as he jiggles his handkerchief in front of me.“Since books are essential to his work, I suppose one shouldn’t complain, but his eccentricity is so pronounced that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”Waverhouse assumes that she’s adopting a new line of attack.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“True,” he interrupts, “he is a little eccentric, but any man who pursues learning tends to get like that.” His answer, excellently noncommittal, contrives to combine ingratiation and special pleading.“The other day, when he had to go somewhere soon after he got home from school, he found it too troublesome to change his clothes.So do you know, he sat down on his low desk without even taking off his overcoat and ate his dinner just as he was.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He had his tray put on the footwarmer while I sat on the floor holding the rice container.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was really very funny.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“It sounds like the old-time custom when generals sat down to identify the severed heads of enemies killed in battle.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But that would be quite typical of Mr. Sneaze.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At any rate he’s never boringly conventional.”Waverhouse offers a somewhat strained compliment.“A woman cannot say what’s conventional or unconventional, but I do think his conduct is often unduly odd.”“Still, that’s better than being conventional.” As Waverhouse moves firmly to the support of my master, her dissatisfaction deepens.“People are always saying this or that is conventional, but would you please tell what makes a thing conventional?” Adopting a defiant attitude, she demands a definition of conventionality.“Conventional?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
When one says something is conventional.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s a bit difficult to explain.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“If it’s so vague a thing, surely there’s nothing wrong with being conventional.” She begins to corner Waverhouse with typically feminine logic.“No, it isn’t vague, it’s perfectly clear-cut.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But it’s hard to explain.”“I expect you call everything you don’t like conventional.” Though totally uncalculated, her words land smack on target.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Waverhouse is now indeed cornered and can no longer dodge defining the conventional.“I’ll give you an example.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A conventional man is one who would yearn after a girl of sixteen or eighteen but, sunk in silence, never do anything about it; a man who, whenever the weather’s fine, would do no more than stroll along the banks of the Sumida taking, of course, a flask of saké with him.”“Are there really such people?” Since she cannot make heads or tails of the twaddle vouchsafed by Waverhouse, she begins to abandon her position, which she finally surrenders by saying, “It’s all so complicated that it’s really quite beyond me.”“You think that complicated?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Imagine fitting the head of Major Pendennis onto Bakin’s torso, wrapping it up and leaving it all for one or two years exposed to European air.”“Would that produce a conventional man?” Waverhouse offers no reply but merely laughs.“In fact it could be produced without going to quite so much trouble.If you added a shop assistant from a leading store to any middle school student and divided that sum by two, then indeed you’d have a fine example of a conventional man.”“Do you really think so?” She looks puzzled but certainly unconvinced.“Are you still here?” My master sits himself down on the floor beside Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We had not noticed his return.“ ‘Still here’ is a bit hard.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You said you wouldn’t be long and you yourself invited me to wait for you.”“You see, he’s always like that,” remarks the lady of the house leaning toward Waverhouse.“While you were away I heard all sorts of tales about you.”“The trouble with women is that they talk too much.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would be good if human beings would keep as silent as this cat.” And the master strokes my head.“I hear you’ve been cramming grated radish into the baby.”“Hum,” says my master and laughs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He then added “Talking of the baby, modern babies are quite intelligent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since that time when I gave our baby grated radish, if you ask him ‘where is the hot place?’ he invariably sticks out his tongue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Isn’t it strange?”“You sound as if you were teaching tricks to a dog.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s positively cruel.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By the way, Coldmoon ought to have arrived by now.”“Is Coldmoon coming?” asks my master in a puzzled voice.“Yes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I sent him a postcard telling him to be here not later than one o’clock.”“How very like you!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Without even asking us if it happened to be convenient.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s the idea of asking Coldmoon here?”“It’s not really my idea, but Coldmoon’s own request.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It seems he is going to give a lecture to the Society of Physical Science.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He said he needed to rehearse his speech and asked me to listen to it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, I thought it would be obliging to let you hear it, too.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, I suggested he should come to your house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which should be quite convenient since you are a man of leisure.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I know you never have any engagements.You’d do well to listen.” Waverhouse thinks he knows how to handle the situation.“I wouldn’t understand a lecture on physical science,” says my master in a voice betraying his vexation at his friend’s high-handed action.“On the contrary, his subject is no such dry-as-dust matter as, for example, the magnetized nozzle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"In a fine frock-coat and with a high and exceedingly white clean collar, he looks twenty per cent more handsome than himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Sorry to be late.” He greets his two seated friends with perfect composure.“It’s ages that we’ve now been waiting for you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"He remarks, “I think I’ll have a glass of water, please.”“I see you are going to do it in real style.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’ll be calling next for a round of applause.” Waverhouse, but he alone, seems to be enjoying himself.Coldmoon produced his text from an inside pocket and observed,“Since it is the established practice, may I say I would welcome criticism.”That invitation made, he at last begins to deliver his lecture.“Hanging as a death penalty appears to have originated among the Anglo-Saxons.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Previously, in ancient times, hanging was mainly a method of committing suicide.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I understand that among the Hebrews it was customary to execute criminals by stoning them to death.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Study of the Old Testament reveals that the word ‘hanging’ is there used to mean ‘suspending a criminal’s body after death for wild beasts and birds of prey to devour it.’According to Herodotus, it would seem that the Jews, even before they departed from Egypt, abominated the mere thought that their dead bodies might be left exposed at night.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

Do you think that wise?”“Please be patient.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am just coming to the main subject.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, with respect to the Persians.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They, too, seemed to have used crucifixion as a method of criminal execution.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, whether the nailing took place while the criminal was alive or simply after his death is not incontrovertibly established.”“Who cares?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such details are really of little importance,” yawned my master as from boredom.“There are still many matters of which I’d like to inform you but, as it will perhaps prove tedious for you .",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“ ‘As it might prove’ would sound better than ‘as it will perhaps prove.’ What d’you think, Sneaze?” Waverhouse starts carping again but my master answers coldly, “What difference could it make?”“I have now come to the main subject, and will accordingly recite my piece.”“A storyteller ‘recites a piece.’An orator should use more elegant diction.”Waverhouse again interrupts.“If to ‘recite my piece’ sounds vulgar, what words should I use?” asks Coldmoon in a voice that showed he was somewhat nettled.“It is never clear, when one is dealing with Waverhouse, whether he’s listening or interrupting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Pay no attention to his heckling, Coldmoon, just keep going.” My master seeks to find a way through the difficulty as quickly as possible.“So, having made your indignant recitation, now I suppose you’ve found the willow tree?” With a pun on a little known haiku, Waverhouse, as usual, comes up with something odd.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldmoon, in spite of himself, broke into laughter.“My researches reveal that the first account of the employment of hanging as a deliberate means of execution occurs in the Odyssey, volume twenty-two.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The relevant passage records how Telemachus arranged the execution by hanging of Penelope’s twelve ladies-in-waiting.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I could read the passage aloud in its original Greek, but, since such an act might be regarded as an affectation, I will refrain from doing so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You will, however, find the passage between lines 465 and 473.”“You’d better cut out all that Hellenic stuff.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It sounds as if you are just showing off your knowledge of Greek.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What do you think, Sneaze?”“On that point, I agree with you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would be more modest, altogether an improvement, to avoid such ostentation.” Quite unusually my master immediately sides with Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The reason is, of course, that neither can read a word of Greek.“Very well, I will this evening omit those references.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And now I will recite.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"that is to say, I will now continue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Let us consider, then, how a hanging is actually carried out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One can envisage two methods.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The first method is that adopted by Telemachus who, with the help of Eumaeus and Philoetios, tied one end of a rope to the top of a pillar: next, having made several loose loops in the rope, he forced a woman’s head through each such loop, and finally hauled up hard on the other end of the rope.”“In short, he had the women dangling in a row like shirts hung out at a laundry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Right?”“Exactly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now the second method is, as in the first case, to tie one end of a rope to the top of a pillar and similarly to secure the other end of the rope somewhere high up on the ceiling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thereafter, several other short ropes are attached to the main rope, and in each of these subsidiary ropes a slip-knot is then tied.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The women’s heads are then inserted in the slipknots.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The idea is that at the crucial moment you remove the stools on which the women have been stood.”“They would then look something like those ball-shaped paper-lanterns one sometimes sees suspended from the end-tips of rope curtains, wouldn’t they?” hazarded Waverhouse.“That I cannot say,” answered Coldmoon cautiously.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I have never seen any such ball as a paper-lantern-ball, but if such balls exist, the resemblance may be just.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, the first method as described in the Odyssey is, in fact, mechanically impossible; and I shall proceed, for your benefit, to substantiate that statement.”“How interesting,” says Waverhouse.“Indeed, most interesting,” adds my master.“Let us suppose that the women are to be hanged at intervals of an equal distance, and that the rope between the two women nearest the ground stretches out horizontally, right?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now α1, α2 up to α6 become the angles between the rope and the horizon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"T1, T2, and so on up to T6 represent the force exerted on each section of the rope, so that T7 = X is the force exerted on the lowest part of the rope.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"W is, of course, the weight of the women.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So far so good.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Are you with me?”My master and Waverhouse exchange glances and say, “Yes, more or less.” I need hardly point out that the value of this “more or less” is singular to Waverhouse and my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It could possibly have a different value for other people.“Well, in accordance with the theory of averages as applied to the polygon, a theory with which you must of course be well acquainted, the following twelve equations can, in this particular case, be established:T1 cos αl=T2 cos α2......(1)T2 cos α2=T3 cos α3......(2)”“I think that’s enough of the equations,” my master irresponsibly remarks.“But these equations are the very essence of my lecture.” Coldmoon really seems reluctant to be parted from them.“In that case, let’s hear those particular parts of its very essence at some other time.” Waverhouse, too, seems out of his depth.“But if I omit the full detail of the equations, it becomes impossible to substantiate the mechanical studies to which I have devoted so much effort.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Oh, never mind that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Cut them all out,” came the cold-blooded comment of my master.“That’s most unreasonable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, since you insist, I will omit them.”“That’s good,” says Waverhouse, unexpectedly clapping his hands.“Now we come to England where, in Beowulf, we find the word ‘gallows’: that is to say ‘galga.’ It follows that hanging as a penalty must have been in use as early as the period with which the book is concerned.According to Blackstone, a convicted person who is not killed at his first hanging by reason of some fault in the rope should simply be hanged again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, oddly enough, one finds it stated in The Vision of Piers Plowman that even a murderer should not be strung up twice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I do not know which statement is correct, but there are many melancholy instances of victims failing to be killed outright.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In 1786 the authorities attempted to hang a notorious villain named Fitzgerald, but when the stool was removed, by some strange chance the rope broke.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
At the next attempt the rope proved so long that his legs touched ground and he again survived.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the end, at the third attempt, he was enabled to die with the help of the spectators.”“Well, well,” says Waverhouse becoming, as was only to be expected, re-enlivened.“A true thanatophile.” Even my master shows signs of jollity.“There is one other interesting fact.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A hanged person grows taller by about an inch.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This is perfectly true.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Doctors have measured it.”“That’s a novel notion.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How about it, Sneaze?” says Waverhouse turning to my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Try getting hanged.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you were an inch taller, you might acquire the appearance of an ordinary human being.” The reply, however, was delivered with an unexpected gravity.“Tell me, Coldmoon, is there any chance of surviving that process of extension by one inch?”“Absolutely none.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The point is that it is the spinal cord which gets stretched in hanging.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s more a matter of breaking than of growing taller.”“In that case, I won’t try.” My master abandons hope.There was still a good deal of the lecture left to deliver and Coldmoon had clearly been anxious to deal with the question of the physiological function of hanging.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But Waverhouse made so many and such capriciously-phrased interjections and my master yawned so rudely and so frequently that Coldmoon finally broke off his rehearsal in mid-flow and took his leave.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I cannot tell you what oratorical triumphs he achieved, still less what gestures he employed that evening, because the lecture took place miles away from me.A few days passed uneventfully by.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, one day about two in the afternoon, Waverhouse dropped in with his usual casual manners and looking as totally uninhibited as his own concept of the “Accidental Child.” The minute he sat down he asked abruptly, “Have you heard about Beauchamp Blowlamp and the Takanawa Incident?” He spoke excitedly, in a tone of voice appropriate to an announcement of the fall of Port Arthur.“No, I haven’t seen him lately.” My master is his usual cheerless self.“I’ve come today, although I’m busy, especially to inform you of the frightful blunder which Beauchamp has committed.”“You’re exaggerating again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed you’re quite impossible.”“Impossible, never: improbable, perhaps.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I must ask you to make a distinction on this point, for it affects my honor.”“It’s the same thing,” replied my master assuming an air of provoking indifference.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is the very image of a Mr. the-late-and-sainted Natural Man.“Last Sunday, Beauchamp went to the Sengaku Temple at Takanawa, which was silly in this cold weather, especially when to make such a visit nowadays stamps one as a country bumpkin out to see the sights.”“But Beauchamp’s his own master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’ve no right to stop him going.”“True, I haven’t got the right, so let’s not bother about that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The point is that the temple yard contains a showroom displaying relics of the forty-seven ronin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Do you know it?”“N-no.”“You don’t?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But surely you’ve been to the Temple?”“No.”“Well, I am surprised.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No wonder you so ardently defended Beauchamp.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But it’s positively shameful that a citizen of Tokyo should never have visited the Sengaku Temple.”“One can contrive to teach without trailing out to the ends of the city.” My master grows more and more like his blessed Natural Man.“All right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, Beauchamp was examining the relics when a married couple, Germans as it happened, entered the showroom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They began by asking him questions in Japanese, but, as you know, Beauchamp is always aching to practice his German so he naturally responded by rattling off a few words in that language.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Apparently he did it rather well.Indeed, when one thinks back over the whole deplorable incident, his very fluency was the root cause of the trouble.”“Well, what happened?” My master finally succumbs.“The Germans pointed out a gold-lacquered pill-box which had belonged to Otaka Gengo and, saying they wished to buy it, asked Beauchamp if the object were for sale.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Beauchamp’s reply was not uninteresting.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He said such a purchase would be quite impossible because all Japanese people were true gentlemen of the sternest integrity.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Up to that point he was doing fine.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, the Germans, thinking that they’d found a useful interpreter, thereupon deluged him with questions.”“About what?”“That’s just it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he had understood their questions, there would have been no trouble.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But you see he was subjected to floods of such questions, all delivered in rapid German, and he simply couldn’t make head or tail of what was being asked.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When at last he chanced to understand part of their outpourings, it was something about a fireman’s axe or a mallet—some word he couldn’t translate—so again, naturally, he was completely at a loss how to reply.”“That I can well imagine,” sympathizes my master, thinking of his own difficulties as a teacher.“Idle onlookers soon began to gather around and eventually Beauchamp and the Germans were totally surrounded by staring eyes.In his confusion Beauchamp fell to blushing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In contrast to his earlier self-confidence he was now at his wit’s end.”“How did it all turn out?”“In the end Beauchamp could stand it no longer, shouted sainara in Japanese and came rushing home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I pointed out to him that sainara was an odd phrase to use and inquired whether, in his home-district, people used sainara rather than sayonara.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He replied they would say sayonara but, since he was talking to Europeans, he had used sainara in order to maintain harmony.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I must say I was much impressed to find him a man mindful of harmony even when in difficulties.”“So that’s the bit about sainara.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What did the Europeans do?”“I hear that the Europeans looked utterly flabbergasted.” And Waverhouse gave vent to laughter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Interesting, eh?”“Frankly, no.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I really can’t find anything particularly interesting in your story.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But that you should have come here specially to tell me the tale, that I do find much more interesting.” My master taps his cigarette’s ash into the brazier.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just at that moment the bell on the lattice door at the entrance rang with an alarming loudness, and a piercing woman’s voice declared, “Excuse me.” Waverhouse and my master look at each other in silence.Even while I am thinking that it is unusual for my master’s house to have a female visitor, the owner of that piercing voice enters the room.She is wearing two layers of silk crepe kimono, and looks to be a little over forty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Her forelock towers up above the bald expanse of her brow like the wall of a dyke and sticks out toward heaven for easily one half the length of her face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her eyes, set at an angle like a road cut through a mountain, slant up symmetrically in straight lines.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I speak, of course, metaphorically.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her eyes, in fact, are even narrower than those of a whale.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But her nose is exceedingly large.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It gives the impression that it has been stolen from someone else and thereafter fastened in the center of her face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is as if a large, stone lantern from some major shrine had been moved to a tiny ten-square-meter garden.It certainly asserts its own importance, but yet looks out of place.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It could almost be termed hooked: it begins by jutting sharply out, but then, halfway along its length, it suddenly turns shy so that its tip, bereft of the original vigour, hangs limply down to peer into the mouth below.Her nose is such that, when she speaks, it is the nose rather than the mouth which seems to be in action.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, in homage to the enormity of that organ, I shall refer hence forward to its owner as Madam Conk.When the ceremonials of her self-introduction had been completed, she glared around the room and remarked, “What a nice house.”“What a liar,” says my master to himself, and concentrates upon his smoking.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Waverhouse studies the ceiling.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Tell me,” he says, “is that odd pattern the result of a rain leak or is it inherent in the grain of the wood?”“Rain leak, naturally” replies my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To which Waverhouse coolly answers, “Wonderful.”Madam Conk clearly regards them as unsociable persons and boils quietly with suppressed annoyance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For a time the three of them just sit there in a triangle without saying a word.“I’ve come to ask you about a certain matter.” Madam Conk starts up again.“Ah.” My master’s response lacks warmth.Madam Conk, dissatisfied with this development, bestirs herself again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I live nearby.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, at the residence on the corner of the block across the road.”“That large house in the European style, the one with a godown?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ah, yes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Of course.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Have I not seen ‘Goldfield’ on the nameplate of that dwelling?” My master, at last, seems ready to take cognizance of Goldfield’s European house and his incorporated godown, but his attitude toward Madam Conk displays no deepening of respect.“Of course my husband should call upon you and seek your valued advice, but he is always so busy with his company affairs.” She puts on a “that ought to shift them” face, but my master remains entirely unimpressed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is, in fact, displeased by her manner of speaking, finding it too direct in a woman met for the first time.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“And not of just one company either.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is connected with two or three of them and is a director of them all, as I expect you already know.” She looks as if saying to herself, “Now surely he should feel small.” In point of fact, the master of this house behaves most humbly toward anyone who happens to be a doctor or a professor, but, oddly enough, he offers scant respect toward businessmen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He considers a middle school teacher to be a more elevated person than any businessman.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even if he doesn’t really believe this, he is quite resigned, being of an unadaptable nature, to the fact that he can never hope to be smiled upon by businessmen or millionaires.For he feels nothing but indifference toward any person, no matter how rich or influential, from whom he has ceased to hope for benefits.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He consequently pays not the faintest attention to anything extraneous to the society of scholars, and is almost actively disinterested in the goings-on of the business world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Had he even the vaguest knowledge of the activities of businessmen, he still could never muster the slightest feeling of awe or respect for such abysmal persons.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"While, for her part, Madam Conk could never stretch her imagination to the point of considering that any being so eccentric as my master could actually exist, that any corner of the world might harbor such an oddity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her experience has included meetings with many people and invariably, as soon as she declares that she is wife to Goldfield, their attitude towards her never fails immediately to alter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At any party whatsoever and no matter how lofty the social standing of any man before whom she happens to find herself, she has always found that Mrs. Goldfield is eminently acceptable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How then could she fail to impress such an obscure old teacher?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She had expected that the mere mention of the fact that her house was the corner residence of the opposite block would startle my master even before she added information about Mr. Goldfield’s notable activities in the world of business.“Do you know anyone called Goldfield?” my master inquires of Waverhouse with the utmost nonchalance.“Of course I know him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s a friend of my uncle.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only the other day he was present at our garden party.” Waverhouse answers in a serious manner.“Really?” said my master.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“And who, may I ask, is your uncle?”“Baron Makiyama,” replied Waverhouse in even graver tones.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master is obviously about to say something, but before he can bring himself to words, Madam Conk turns abruptly toward Waverhouse and subjects him to a piercing stare.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse, secure in a kimono of the finest silk, remains entirely unperturbed.“Oh, you are Baron Makiyama’s.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That I didn’t know.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I hope you’ll excuse me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve heard so much about Baron Makiyama from my husband.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He tells me that the Baron has always been so helpful.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.” Madam Conk’s manner of speech has suddenly become polite.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She even bows.“Ah yes,” observes Waverhouse who is inwardly laughing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, quite astonished, watches the two in silence.“I understand he has even troubled the Baron about our daughter’s marriage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Has he indeed?” exclaims Waverhouse as if surprised.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even Waverhouse seems somewhat taken aback by this unexpected development.“We are, in fact, receiving proposal after proposal in respect of marriage to our daughter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They flood in from all over the place.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You will appreciate that, having to think seriously of our social position, we cannot rashly marry off our daughter to just anyone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Quite so.” Waverhouse feels relieved.“I have, in point of fact, made this visit precisely to raise with you a question about this marriage matter.” Madam Conk turns back to my master and reverts to her earlier vulgar style of speech.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I hear that a certain Avalon Coldmoon pays you frequent visits.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What sort of a man is he?”“Why do you want to know about Coldmoon?” replies my master in a manner revealing his displeasure.“Perhaps it is in connection with your daughter’s marriage that you wish to know something about the character of Coldmoon,” puts in Waverhouse tactfully.“If you could tell me about his character, it would indeed be helpful.”“Then is it that you want to give your daughter in marriage to Coldmoon?”“It’s not a question of my wanting to give her.” Madam Conk immediately squashes my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Since there will be innumerable proposals, we couldn’t care less if he doesn’t marry her.”“In that case, you don’t need any information about Coldmoon,” my master replies with matching heat.“But you’ve no reason to withhold information.” Madam Conk adopts an almost defiant attitude.Waverhouse, sitting between the two and holding his silver pipe as if it were an umpire’s instrument of office, is secretly beside himself with glee.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His gloating heart urges them on to yet more extravagant exchanges.“Tell me, did Coldmoon actually say he wanted to marry her?” My master fires a broadside pointblank.“He didn’t actually say he wanted to, but.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“You just think it likely that he might want to?” My master seems to have realized that broadsides are best in dealing with this woman.“The matter is not yet so far advanced, but.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"well, I don’t think Mr.Coldmoon is wholly averse to the idea.” Madam Conk rallies well in her extremity.“Is there any concrete evidence whatsoever that Coldmoon is enamored of this daughter of yours?” My master, as if to say, “now answer me if you can,” sticks out his chest belligerently.“Well, more or less, yes.” This time my master’s militance has failed in its effect.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse has hitherto been so delighted with his self-appointed role of umpire that he has simply sat and watched the scrap, but now his curiosity seems suddenly to have been aroused.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He puts down the pipe and leans forward.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Has Coldmoon sent your daughter a love letter?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What fun!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One more new event since the New Year and, at that, a splendid subject for debate.” Waverhouse alone is pleased.“Not a love letter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Something much more ardent than that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Are you two really so much in the dark?” Madam Conk adopts a disbelieving attitude.“Are you aware of anything?” My master, looking nonplussed, addresses himself to Waverhouse.Waverhouse takes refuge in banter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I know nothing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If anyone should know, it would be you.” His reaction is disappointingly modest.“But the two of you know all about it,” Madam Conk triumphs over both of them.“Oh!”The sound expressed their simultaneous astonishment.“In case you’ve forgotten, let me remind you of what happened.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At the end of last year Mr. Coldmoon went to a concert at the Abe residence in Mukōjima, right?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That evening, on his way home, something happened at Azuma Bridge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You remember?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"l won’t repeat the details since that might compromise the person in question, but what I’ve said is surely proof enough.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What do you think?” She sits bolt-upright with her diamond-ringed fingers in her lap.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her magnificent nose looks more resplendent than ever, so much so that Waverhouse and my master seem practically obliterated.My master, naturally, but Waverhouse also, appear dumbfounded by this surprise attack.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For a while they just sit there in bewilderment, like patients whose fits of ague have suddenly ceased.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But as the first shock of their astonishment subsides and they come slowly back to normality, their sense of humor irrepressibly asserts itself and they burst into gales of laughter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Madam Conk, baulked in her expectations and, ill-prepared for this reaction of rude laughing, glares at both of them.“Was that your daughter?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Isn’t it wonderful!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’re quite right.Indeed Coldmoon must be mad about her.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I say, Sneaze, there’s no point now in trying to keep it secret.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let’s make a clean breast of everything.”My master just says “Hum.”“There’s certainly no point in your trying to keep it secret.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The cat’s already out of the bag.” Madam Conk is once more cock-a-hoop.“Yes, indeed, we’re cornered.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We’ll have to make a true statement on everything concerning Coldmoon for this lady’s information.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sneaze!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
you’re the host here.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Pull yourself together, man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Stop grinning like that or we’ll never get this business sorted out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s extraordinary.Secretiveness is a most mysterious matter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However well one guards a secret, sooner or later it’s bound to come out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, when you come to think of it, it really is most extraordinary.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tell us, Mrs. Goldfield, how did you ever discover this secret?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am truly amazed.” Waverhouse rattles on.“I’ve a nose for these things.” Madam Conk declares with some self-satisfaction.“You must indeed be very well informed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Who on earth has told you about this matter?”“The wife of the rickshawman who lives just there at the back.”“Do you mean that man who owns that vile black cat?” My master is wide-eyed.“Yes, your Mr. Coldmoon has cost me a pretty penny.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every time he comes here I want to know what he talks about, so I’ve arranged for the wife of the rickshawman to learn what happens and to report it all to me.”“But that’s terrible!” My master raises his voice.“Don’t worry, I don’t give a damn what you do or say.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m not in the least concerned with you, only with Mr. Coldmoon.”“Whether with Coldmoon or with anyone else.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, that rickshaw woman is a quite disgusting creature.” My master begins to get angry.“But surely she is free to stand outside your hedge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you don’t want your conversations overheard, you should either talk less loudly or live in a larger house.” Madam Conk is clearly not the least ashamed of herself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“And that’s not my only source.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve also heard a deal of stuff from the Mistress of the two-stringed harp.”“You mean about Coldmoon?”“Not solely about Coldmoon.” This sounds menacing but, far from retreating in embarrassment, my master retorts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“That woman gives herself such airs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Acting as though she and she alone were the only person of any standing in this neighborhood.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A vain, an idiotic fellow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Pardon me!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s a woman you’re describing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A fellow, did you say?Believe me, you’re talking out of the back of your neck.” Her language more and more betrays her vulgar origin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, it now appears as if she has only come in order to pick a quarrel.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But Waverhouse, typically, just sits listening to the quarrel as if it were being conducted for his amusement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, he looks like a Chinese sage at a cockfight: cool and above it all.My master at last realizes that he can never match Madam Conk in the exchange of scurrilities, and he lapses into a forced silence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But eventually a bright idea occurs to him.“You’ve been speaking as though it were Coldmoon who was besotted with your daughter, but from what I’ve heard, the situation is quite different.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Isn’t that so,Waverhouse?”“Certainly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As we heard it, your daughter fell ill and then, we understand, began babbling in delirium.”“No.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’ve got it all wrong.” Madam Conk gives the lie direct.“But Coldmoon undoubtedly said that that was what he had been told by Dr. O’s wife.”“That was our trap.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We’d asked the Doctor’s wife to play that trick on Coldmoon precisely in order to see how he’d react.”“Did the doctor’s wife agree to this deception in full knowledge that it was a trick?”“Yes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Of course we couldn’t expect her to help us purely for affection’s sake.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I’ve said, we’ve had to lay out a very pretty penny on one thing and another.”“You are quite determined to impose yourself upon us and quiz us in detail about Coldmoon, eh?” Even Waverhouse seems to be getting annoyed for he uses some sharpish turns of phrase quite unlike his usual manner.“Ah well, Sneaze,” he continues, “what do we lose if we talk?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let’s tell her everything.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, Mrs. Goldfield, both Sneaze and I will tell you anything within reason about Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But it would be more convenient for us if you’d present your questions one at a time.”Madam Conk was thus at last brought to see reason.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And when she began to pose her questions, her style of speech, only recently so coarsely violent, acquired a certain civil polish, at least when she spoke to Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I understand,” she opens, “that Mr. Coldmoon is a bachelor of science.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now please tell me in what sort of subject has he specialized?”“In his post-graduate course, he’s studying terrestrial magnetism,” answers my master seriously.Unfortunately, Madam Conk does not understand this answer.Therefore, though she says, “Ah,” she looks dubious and asks: “If one studies that, could one obtain a doctor’s degree?”“Are you seriously suggesting that you wouldn’t allow your daughter to marry him unless he held a doctorate?” The tone of my master’s inquiry discloses his deep displeasure.“That’s right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After all, if it’s just a bachelor’s degree, there are so many of them!” Madam Conk replies with complete unconcern.My master’s glance at Waverhouse reveals a deepening disgust.“Since we cannot be sure whether or not he’ll gain a doctorate, you’ll have to ask us something else.”Waverhouse seems equally displeased.“Is he still just studying that terrestrial something?”“A few days ago,” my master quite innocently offers, “he made a speech on the results of his investigation of the mechanics of hanging.”“Hanging?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How dreadful!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He must be peculiar.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I don’t suppose he could ever become a doctor by devoting himself to hanging.”“It would of course be difficult for him to gain a doctorate if he actually hanged himself, but it is not impossible to become a doctor through study of the mechanics of hanging.”“Is that so?” she answers, trying to read my master’s expression.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s a sad, sad thing but, since she does not know what mechanics are, she cannot help feeling uneasy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She probably thinks that to ask the meaning of such a trifling matter might involve her in loss of face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Like a fortuneteller, she tries to guess the truth from facial expressions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master’s face is glum.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Is he studying anything else, something more easy to understand?”“He once wrote a treatise entitled ‘A Discussion of the Stability of Acorns in Relation to the Movements of Heavenly Bodies.’”“Does one really study such things as acorns at a university?”“Not being a member of any university, I cannot answer your question with complete certainty, but since Coldmoon is engaged in such studies, the subject must undoubtedly be worth studying.” With a dead-pan face,Waverhouse makes fun of her.Madam Conk seems to have realized that her questions about matters of scholarship have carried her out of her depth, for she changes the subject.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“By the way,” she says, “I hear that he broke two of his front teeth when eating mushrooms during the New Year season.”“True, and a rice-cake became fixed on the broken part.”Waverhouse, feeling that this question is indeed up his street, suddenly becomes light-hearted.“How unromantic!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I wonder why he doesn’t use a toothpick!”“Next time I see him, I’ll pass on your sage advice,” says my master with a chuckle.“If his teeth can be snapped on mushrooms, they must be in very poor condition.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What do you think?”“One could hardly say such teeth were good.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Could one, Waverhouse?”“Of course they can’t be good, but they do provide a certain humor.It’s odd that he hasn’t had them filled.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It really is an extraordinary sight when a man just leaves his teeth to become mere hooks for snagging rice-cakes.”“Is it because he lacks the money to get them filled or because he’s just so odd that he leaves them unattended to?”“Ah, you needn’t worry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I don’t suppose he will continue as Mr.Broken Front Tooth for any long time.” Waverhouse is evidently regaining his usual bouyancy.Madam Conk again changes the subject.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“If you should have some letter or anything which he’s written, I’d like to see it.”“I have masses of postcards from him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Please have a look at them,” and my master produces some thirty or forty postcards from his study.“Oh, I don’t have to look at so many of them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
perhaps two or three would do.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Let me choose some for you,” offers Waverhouse, adding as he selects a picture postcard, “Here’s an interesting one.”“Gracious!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So he paints pictures as well?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Rather clever that,” she exclaims.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But after examining the picture she remarks “How very silly!It’s a badger!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Why on earth does he have to paint a badger of all things!Strange.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But it does indeed look like a badger.” She is, albeit reluctantly, mildly impressed.“Read what he’s written beside it,” suggests my master with a laugh.Madam Conk begins to read aloud like a servant-girl deciphering a newspaper.“On New Year’s Eve, as calculated under the ancient calendar, the mountain badgers hold a garden party at which they dance excessively.Their song says, ‘This evening, being New Year’s Eve, no mountain hikers will come this way.’ And bom-bom-bom they thump upon their bellies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What is he writing about?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is he not being a trifle frivolous?” Madam Conk seems seriously dissatisfied.“Doesn’t this heavenly maiden please you?” Waverhouse picks out another card on which a kind of angel in celestial raiment is depicted as playing upon a lute.“The nose of this heavenly maiden seems rather too small.”“Oh no, that’s about the average size for an angel.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But forget the nose for the moment and read what it says,” urges Waverhouse.“It says ‘Once upon a time there was an astronomer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One night he went as was his wont high up into his observatory, and, as he was intently watching the stars, a beautiful heavenly maiden appeared in the sky and began to play some music; music too delicate ever to be heard on earth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The astronomer was so entranced by the music that he quite forgot the dark night’s bitter cold.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Next morning the dead body of the astronomer was found covered with pure white frost.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An old man, a liar, told me that this story was all true.’ What the hell is this?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It makes no sense, no nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Can Coldmoon really be a bachelor of science?Perhaps he should read a few literary magazines.”Thus mercilessly does Madam Conk lambaste the defenseless Coldmoon.Waverhouse for fun selects a third postcard and says, “Well then, what about this one?” The card has a sailing boat printed on it and, as usual, there is something scribbled underneath the picture.Last night a tiny whore of sixteen summersDeclared she had no parents.Like a plover on a reefy coast,She wept on waking in the early morning.Her parents, sailors both, lie at the bottom of the sea.“Oh, that’s good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How very clever!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s got real feeling,” erupted Madam Conk.“Feeling?” says Waverhouse.“Oh yes,” says Madam Conk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“That would go well on a samisen.“If it could be played on the samisen, then it’s the real McCoy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, how about these?” asks Waverhouse picking out postcard after postcard.“Thank you, but I’ve seen enough.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For now, at least I know that Coldmoon’s not a straight-laced prude.” She thinks she has achieved some real understanding and appears to have no more queries about Coldmoon, for she remarks, “I’m sorry to have troubled you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Please do not report my visit to Mr. Coldmoon.” Her request reflects her selfish nature in that she seems to feel entitled to make a thorough investigation of Coldmoon whilst expecting that none of her activities should be revealed to him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Both Waverhouse and my master concede a half-hearted “Y-es,” but as Madam Conk gets up to leave, she consolidates their assent by saying, “I shall, of course, at some later date repay you for your services.”The two men showed her out and, as they resumed their seats, Waverhouse exclaimed, “What on earth is that?” At the very same moment my master also ejaculated, “Whatever’s that?” I suppose my master’s wife could not restrain her laughter any longer, for we heard her gurgling in the inner-room.Waverhouse thereupon addressed her in a loud voice through the sliding door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“That, Mrs. Sneaze, was a remarkable specimen of all that is conventional, of all that is ‘common or garden.’ But when such characteristics become developed to that incredible degree the result is positively staggering.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such quintessence of the common approximates to the unique.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t seek to restrain yourself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Laugh to your heart’s content.”With evident disgust my master speaks in tones of the deepest revulsion.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“To begin with,” he says, “her face is unattractive.”Waverhouse immediately takes the cue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“And that nose, squatting, as it were, in the middle of that phiz, seems affectedly unreal.”“Not only that, it’s crooked.”“Hunchbacked, one might say.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A hunchbacked nose!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quite extraordinary.” And Waverhouse laughs in genuine delight.“It is the face of a woman who keeps her husband under her bottom.”My master still looks resentful.“It is a sort of physiognomy that, left unsold in the nineteenth century, becomes in the twentieth shop-soiled.”Waverhouse produces another of his invariably bizarre remarks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At which juncture my master’s wife emerges from the inner-room and, being a woman and thus aware of the ways of women, quietly warns them, “If you talk such scandal, the rickshaw-owner’s wife will snitch on you again.”“But, Mrs. Sneaze, to hear such tattle will do that Goldfield woman no end of good.”“But it’s self-demeaning to calumniate a person’s face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No one sports that sort of nose as a matter of choice.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Besides, she is a woman.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’re going a little too far.” Her defense of the nose of Madam Conk is simultaneously an indirect defense of her own indifferent looks.“We’re not unkind at all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That creature isn’t a woman.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She’s just an oaf.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse, am I not right?”“Maybe an oaf, but a formidable character nonetheless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She gave you quite a tousling, didn’t she just?”“What does she take a teacher for, anyway?”“She ranks a teacher on roughly the same level as a rickshaw-owner.To earn the respect of such viragoes one needs to have at least a doctor’s degree.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You were ill-advised not to have taken your doctorate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Don’t you agree, Mrs. Sneaze?”Waverhouse looks at her with a smile.“A doctorate?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Quite impossible.” Even his wife despairs of my master.“You never know.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I might become one, one of these days.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You mustn’t always doubt my worth.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You may well be ignorant of the fact, but in ancient times a certain Greek, lsocrates, produced major literary works at the age of ninety-four.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Similarly, Sophocles was almost a centenarian when he shook the world with his masterpiece.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Simonides was writing wonderful poetry in his eighties.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I, too.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Don’t be silly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How can you possibly expect, you with your stomach troubles, to live that long.” Mrs. Sneaze has already determined my master’s span of life.“How dare you!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just go and talk to Dr. Amaki.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, it’s all your fault.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s because you make me wear this crumpled black cotton surcoat and this patched-up kimono that I am despised by women like Mrs.Goldfield.Very well then.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
From tomorrow I shall rig myself out in such fineries as Waverhouse is wearing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So get them ready.”“You may well say ‘get them ready,’ but we don’t possess any such elegant clothes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, Mrs. Goldfield only grew civil to Waverhouse after he’d mentioned his uncle’s name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her attitude was in no way conditioned by the ill-condition of your kimono.” Mrs. Sneaze has neatly dodged the charge against her.The mention of that uncle appears to trigger my master’s memory, for he turns to Waverhouse and says, “That was the first I ever heard of your uncle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You never spoke of him before.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Does he, in fact, exist?”Waverhouse has obviously been expecting this question, and he jumps to answer it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Yes, that uncle of mine, a remarkably stubborn man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He, too, is a survival from the nineteenth century.” He looks at husband and wife.“You do say the quaintest things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Where does this uncle live?” asks Mr.Sneaze with a titter.“In Shizuoka.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But he doesn’t just live.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He lives with a top-knot still on his head.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can you beat it?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When we suggest he should wear a hat, he proudly answers that he has never found the weather cold enough to don such gear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And when we hint that he might be wise to stay abed when the weather’s freezing, he replies that four hour’s sleep is sufficient for any man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is convinced that to sleep more than four hours is sheer extravagance, so he gets up while it’s still pitch-dark.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is his boast that it took many long years of training so to minimize his sleeping hours.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘When I was young,’ he says,‘it was indeed hard because I felt sleepy, but recently I have at last achieved that wonderful condition where I can sleep or wake, anywhere, anytime, just as I happen to wish.’ It is of course natural that a man of sixty-seven should need less sleep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It has nothing to do with early training, but my uncle is happy in the belief that he has succeeded in attaining his present condition entirely as a result of rigorous self-discipline.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And when he goes out, he always carries an iron fan.”“Whatever for?” asks my master.“l haven’t the faintest idea.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He just carries it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps he prefers a fan to a walking stick.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
As a matter of fact an odd thing happened only the other day.”Waverhouse speaks to Mrs. Sneaze.“Ah yes?” she noncommittally responds.“In the spring this year he wrote to me out of the blue with a request that I should send him a bowler hat and a frock-coat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was somewhat surprised and wrote back asking for further clarification.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I received an answer stating that the old man himself intended to wear both items on the occasion of the Shizuoka celebration of the war victory, and that I should therefore send them quickly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was an order.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the quaintness of his letter was that it enjoined me ‘to choose a hat of suitable size and, as for the suit, to go and order one from Daimaru of whatever size you think appropriate.’”“Can one get suits made at Daimaru?”“No.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I think he’d got confused and meant to say at Shirokiya’s.”“Isn’t it a little unhelpful to say ‘of whatever size you think appropriate’?”“That’s just my uncle all over.”“What did you do?”“What could I do?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I ordered a suit which I thought appropriate and sent it to him.”“How very irresponsible!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And did it fit?”“More or less, I think.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For I later noticed in my home-town newspaper that the venerable Mr. Makiyama had created something of a sensation by appearing at the said celebration in a frock coat carrying, as usual, his famous iron fan.”“It seems difficult to part him from that object.”“When he’s buried, I shall ensure that the fan is placed within the coffin.”“Still it was fortunate that the coat and bowler fitted him.”“But they didn’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just when I was congratulating myself that everything had gone off smoothly, a parcel came from Shizuoka.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I opened it expecting some token of his gratitude, but it proved only to contain the bowler.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An accompanying letter stated, ‘Though you have taken the trouble of making this purchase for me, I find the hat too large.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Please be so kind as to take it back to the hatter’s and have it shrunk.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I will of course defray your consequent expenses by postal order.’”“Peculiar, one must admit.” My master seems greatly pleased to discover that there is someone even more peculiar than himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“So what did you do?” he asks.“What did I do?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I could do nothing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m wearing the hat myself.”“And is that the very hat?” says my master with a smirk.“And he’s a Baron?” asks my master’s wife from her mystification.“Is who?”“Your uncle with the iron fan.”“Oh, no.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s a scholar of the Chinese classics.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he was young he studied at that shrine dedicated to Confucius in Yushima and became so absorbed in the teachings of Chu-Tzu that, most reverentially, he continues to wear a top-knot in these days of the electric light.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s nothing one can do about it.” Waverhouse rubs his chin.“But I have the impression that in speaking just now to that awful woman you mentioned a Baron Makiyama.”“Indeed you did.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I heard you quite distinctly, even in the other room.”Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze for once supports her husband.“Oh, did I?” Waverhouse permits himself a snigger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Fancy that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, it wasn’t true.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Had I a Baron for an uncle I would by now be a senior civil servant.”Waverhouse is not in the least embarrassed.“I thought it was somehow queer,” says my master with an expression half-pleased, half-worried.“It’s astonishing how calmly you can lie.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I must say you’re a past master at the game.” Mrs. Sneaze is deeply impressed.“You flatter me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That woman quite outclasses me.”“I don’t think she could match you.”“But, Mrs. Sneaze, my lies are merely tarrydiddles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That woman’s lies, every one of them, have hooks inside them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They’re tricky lies.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Lies loaded with malice aforethought.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They are the spawn of craftiness.Please never confuse such calculated monkey-minded wickedness with my heaven-sent taste for the comicality of things.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Should such confusion prevail, the God of Comedy would have no choice but to weep for mankind’s lack of perspicacity.”“I wonder,” says my master, lowering his eyes, while Mrs. Sneaze, still laughing, remarks that it all comes down to the same thing in the end.Up until now I have never so much as crossed the road to investigate the block opposite.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I have never clapped eyes on the Goldfield’s corner residence so I naturally have no idea what it looks like.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Indeed today is the first time that I’ve even heard of its existence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No one in this house has ever previously talked about a businessman and consequently I, who am my master’s cat, have shared his total disinterest in the world of business and his equally total indifference to businessmen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, having just been present during the colloquy with Madam Conk, having overheard her talk, having imagined her daughter’s beauty and charm, and also having given some thought to that family’s wealth and power, I have come to realize that, though no more than a cat, I should not idle all my days away lying on the veranda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nor only that, I cannot help but feel deep sympathy with Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His opponent has already bribed a doctor’s wife, bribed the wife of the rickshaw-owner, bribed even that high-falutin mistress of the two-stringed harp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She has so spied upon poor Coldmoon that even his broken teeth have been disclosed, while he has done no more than fiddle with the fastenings of his surcoat and, on occasion, grin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He is guileless even for a bachelor of science just out of the university.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And it’s not just anyone who can cope with a woman equipped with such a jut of nose.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master not only lacks the heart for dealing with matters of this sort, but he lacks the money, too.Waverhouse has sufficient money, but is such an inconsequential being that he’d never go out of his way merely to help Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How isolated, then, is that unfortunate person who lectures on the mechanics of hanging.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would be less than fair if I failed at least to try and insinuate myself into the enemy fortress and, for Coldmoon’s sake, pick up news of their activities.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though but a cat, I am not quite as other cats.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I differ from the general run of idiot cats and stupid cats.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am a cat that lodges in the house of a scholar who, having read it, can bang down any book by Epictetus on his desk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Concentrated in the tip of my tail there is sufficient of the spirit of chivalry for me to take it upon myself to venture upon knight-errantry.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is not that I am in any way beholden to poor Coldmoon, nor am I engaging in foolhardy action for the sake of any single individual.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I may be allowed to blow my own trumpet, I am proposing to take magnificent unself-interested action simply in order to realize the will of Heaven that smiles upon impartiality and blesses the happy medium.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since Madam Conk makes impermissible use of such things as the happenings at Azuma Bridge; since she hires underlings to spy and eavesdrop on us; since she triumphantly retails to all and sundry the products of her espionage; since by the employment of rickshaw-folk, mere grooms, plain rogues, student riff-raff, crone daily-help, midwives, witches, masseurs, and other trouble-makers she seeks to trouble a man of talent; for all these reasons even a cat must do what can be done to prevent her getting away with it.The weather, fortunately, is fine.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The thaw is something of nuisance, but one must be prepared to sacrifice one’s life in the cause of justice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If my feet get muddy and stamp plum blossom patterns on the veranda, OSan may be narked but that won’t worry me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For I have come to the superlatively courageous, firm decision that I will not put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, I whisk off around to the kitchen, but, having arrived there, pause for further thought.“Softly, softly,” I say to myself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s not simply that I’ve attained the highest degree of evolution that can occur in cats, but I make bold to believe my brain is as well-developed as that of any boy in his third year at a middle school.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, alas, the construction of my throat is still only that of a cat, and I cannot therefore speak the babbles of mankind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, even if I succeed in sneaking into the Goldfield’s citadel and there discovering matters of moment, I shall remain unable to communicate my discoveries to that Coldmoon who so needs them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Neither shall I be able to communicate my gleanings to my master or to Waverhouse.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such incommunicable knowledge would, like a buried diamond, be denied its brilliance and my hard-won wisdom would all be won for nothing.Which would be stupid.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps I should scrap my plan.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So thinking, I hesitated on the very doorstep.But to abandon a project halfway through breeds a kind of regret, that sense of unfulfillment which one feels when the slower one had so confidently expected drifts away under inky clouds into some other part of the countryside.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, to persist when one is in the wrong is an altogether different matter, but to press on for the sake of so-called justice and humanity, even at the risk of death uncrowned by success, that, for a man who knows his duty, can be a source of the deepest satisfaction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, to engage in fruitless effort and to muddy one’s paws on a fool’s errand would seem about right for a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since it is my misfortune to have been born a cat, I cannot by turns of the tip of my tail convey, as I can to cats, my thinking to such scholars as Coldmoon, Sneaze, and Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, by virtue of felinity, I can, better than all such bookmen, make myself invisible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To do what no one else can do is, of itself, delightful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That I alone should know the inner workings of the Goldfield household is better than if nobody should know.Though I cannot pass my knowledge on, it is still cause for delight that I may make the Goldfields conscious that someone knows their secrets.In the light of this succession of delights, I boldly make to believe my brain is as delightful as well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All right then.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I will go.Coming to the side street in the opposite block, there, sure enough, I find a Western-style house dominating the crossroads as if it owned the whole area.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thinking that the master of such a house must be no less stuck up than his building, I slide past the gate and examine the edifice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Its construction has no merit.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Its two stories rear up into the air for no purpose whatever but to impress, even to coerce, the passersby.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This, I suppose, is what Waverhouse means when he calls things common or garden.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I slink through some bushes, take note of the main entrance to my right, and so find my way round to the kitchen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As might be expected, the kitchen is large—at least ten times as large as that in my master’s dwelling.Everything is in such apple pie order, all so clean and shining, that it cannot be less splendid than that fabulous kitchen of Count Okuma so ful-somely described in a recent product of the national press.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I tell myself, as I slip inside on silent muddy paws, that this must be “a model kitchen.”On the plastered part of its floor the wife of the rickshaw-owner is standing in earnest discussion with a kitchen-maid and a rickshaw-runner.Realizing the dangers of this situation, I hide behind a water-tub.“That teacher, doesn’t he really even know our master’s name?” the kitchen-maid demands.“Of course he knows it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyone in this district who doesn’t know the Goldfield residence must be a deaf cripple without eyes,” snaps the man who pulls the Goldfield’s private rickshaw.“Well, you never know.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That teacher’s one of those cranks who know nothing at all except what it says in books.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
If he knew even the least little thing about Mr. Goldfield he might be scared out of his wits.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But he hasn’t the wits to be scared out of.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why,” snorts Blacky’s bloody-minded mistress, “he doesn’t even know the ages of his own mis-managed children.”“So he’s not afraid of our Mr. Goldfield!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a cussed clot he is!There’s no call to show him the least consideration.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let’s go around and give him something to be scared about.”“Good idea!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He says such dreadful things.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He was telling his crackpot cronies that, since Madam’s nose is far too big for her face, he finds her unattractive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No doubt he thinks himself a proper picture, but his mug’s the spitting image of a terra-cotta badger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What can be done, I ask you, with such an animal?”“And it isn’t only his face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The way he saunters down to the public bathhouse carrying a hand towel is far too high and mighty.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He thinks he’s the cat’s whiskers.” My master Sneaze seems notably unpopular, even with this kitchen-maid.“Let’s all go and call him names as loud as we can from just outside his hedge.”“That’ll bring him down a peg.”“But we mustn’t let ourselves be seen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We must spoil his studying just with shouting, getting him riled as much as we can.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Those are Madam’s latest orders.”“I know all that,” says the rickshaw wife in a voice that makes it clear that she’s only too ready to undertake one-third of their scurrilous assignment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thinking to myself, “So that’s the gang who’re going to ridicule my master,” I drift quietly past the noisesome trio and penetrate yet further into the enemy fortress.Cat’s paws are as if they do not exist.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Wheresoever they may go, they never make clumsy noises.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Cats walk as if on air, as if they trod the clouds, as quietly as a stone going light-tapped under water, as an ancient Chinese harp touched in a sunken cave.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The walking of a cat is the instinctive realization of all that is most delicate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For such as I am concerned, this vulgar Western house simply is not there.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nor do I take cognizance of the rickshaw-woman, manservant, kitchen-maids, the daughter of the house, Madam Conk, her parlor-maids or even her ghastly husband.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For me they do not exist.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I go where I like and I listen to whatever talk it interests me to hear.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thereafter, sticking out my tongue and frisking my tail, I walk home self-composedly with my whiskers proudly stiff.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In this particular field of endeavor there’s not a cat in all Japan so gifted as am I.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I sometimes think I really must be blood-kin to that monster cat one sees in ancient picture books.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They say that every toad carries in its forehead a gem that in the darkness utters light, but packed within my tail I carry not only the power of God, Buddha, Confucius, Love, and even Death, but also an infallible panacea for all ills that could bewitch the entire human race.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I can as easily move unnoticed through the corridors of Goldfield’s awful mansion as a giant god of stone could squash a milk-blancmange.At this point, I become so impressed by my own powers and so conscious of the reverence I consequently owe to my own most precious tail that I feel unable to withhold immediate recognition of its divinity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I desire to pray for success in war by worshiping my honored Great Tail Gracious Deity, so I lower my head a little, only to find I am not facing in the right direction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I make the three appropriate obeisances I should, of course, as far as it is possible, be facing toward my tail.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But as I turn my body to fulfill that requirement, my tail moves away from me.In an effort to catch up with myself, I twist my neck.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But still my tail eludes me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being a thing so sacred, containing as it does the entire universe in its three-inch length, my tail is inevitably beyond my power to control.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I spun round in pursuit of it seven and a half times but, feeling quite exhausted, I finally gave up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel a trifle giddy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For a moment I lose all sense of where I am and, deciding that my whereabouts are totally unimportant, I start to walk about at random.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then I hear the voice of Madam Conk.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It comes from the far side of a paper-window.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My ears prick up in sharp diagonals and, once more fully alert, I hold my breath.This is the place which I set out to find.“He’s far too cocky for a penny-pinching usher,” she’s screaming in that parrot’s voice.“Sure, he’s a cocky fellow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ll have a bit of the bounce taken out of him, just to teach him a lesson.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There are one or two fellows I know, fellows from my own province, teaching at his school.”“What fellows are those?”“Well, there’s Tsuki Pinsuke and Fukuchi Kishago for a start.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ll arrange with them for him to be ragged in class.”I don’t know from what province old man Goldfield comes, but I’m rather surprised to find it stiff with such outlandish names.“Is he a teacher of English?” her husband asks.“Yes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"According to the wife of the rickshaw-owner, his teaching specializes in an English Reader or something like that.”“In any case, he’s gotta be a rotten teacher.”I’m also struck by the vulgarity of that “gotta be” phraseology.“When I saw Pinsuke the other day he mentioned that there was some crackpot at his school.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When asked the English word for bancha, this fathead answered that the English called it, not ‘coarse tea’ as they actually do, but ‘savage tea.’ He’s now the laughing stock of all his teaching colleagues.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Pinsuke added that all the other teachers suffer for this one’s follies.Very likely it’s the self-same loon.”“It’s bound to be.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s got the face you’d expect on a fool who thinks that tea can be savage.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And to think he has the nerve to sport such a dashing mustache!”“Saucy bastard.”If whiskers establish sauciness, every cat is impudent.“As for that man Waverhouse—Staggering Drunk I’d call him—he’s an obstreperous freak if ever I saw one.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Baron Makiyama, his uncle indeed!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was sure that no one with a face like his could have a baron for an uncle.”“You, too, are at fault for believing anything which a man of such dubious origins might say.”“Maybe I was at fault.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But really there’s a limit and he’s gone much too far.” Madam Conk sounds singularly vexed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The odd thing is that neither mentions Coldmoon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wonder if they concluded their discussion about him before I sneaked up on them or whether perhaps they had earlier decided to block his marriage suit and had therefore already forgotten all about him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I remain disturbed about this question, but there’s nothing I can do about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For a little while I lay crouched down in silence but then I heard a bell ring at the far end of the corridor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What’s up down there?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Determined this time not to be late on the scene, I set out smartly in the direction of the sound.I arrived to find some female yattering away by herself in a loud unpleasant voice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since her tones resemble those of Madam Conk, I deduce that this must be that darling daughter, that delicious charmer for whose sake Coldmoon has already risked death by drowning.Unfortunately, the paper-windows between us make it impossible for me to observe her beauty and I cannot therefore be sure whether she, too, has a massive nose plonked down in the center of her face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I infer from her mannerisms, such as the way she sounds to be turning up her nose when she talks, that that organ is unlikely to be an inconspicuous pug-nose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though she talks continuously, nobody seems to be answering, and I deduce that she must be using one of those modern telephones.“Is that the Yamato?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I want to reserve, for tomorrow, the third box in the lower gallery.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All right?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Got it?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What’s that?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You can’t?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But you must.Why should I be joking?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t be such a fool.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Who the devil are you?Chōkichi?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, Chōkichi, you’re not doing very well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Ask the proprietress to come to the phone.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What’s that?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Did you say you were able to cope with any possible inquiries?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How dare you speak to me like that?D’you know who I am?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This is Miss Goldfield speaking.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Oh, you’re well aware of that, are you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You really are a fathead.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Don’t you understand, this is the Goldfield.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Again?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You thank us for being regular patrons?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I don’t want your stupid thanks.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I want the third box in the lower gallery.Don’t laugh, you idiot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You must be terribly stupid.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You are, you say?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you don’t stop being insolent, I shall just ring off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You understand?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I can promise you you’ll be sorry.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Hello.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Are you still there?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hello, hello.Speak up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Answer me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hello, hello, hello.” Chōkichi seems to have hung up, for no answer is forthcoming.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The girl is now in something of a tizzy and she grinds away at the telephone handle as though she’s gone off her head.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A lapdog somewhere around her feet suddenly starts to yap, and, realizing I’d better keep my wits about me, I quickly hop off the veranda and creep in under the house.Just then I hear approaching footsteps and the sound of a paper-door being slid aside.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I tilt my head to listen.“Your father and mother are asking for you, Miss.” It sounds like a parlor-maid.“So who cares?” was the vulgar answer.“They sent me to fetch you because they’ve something they want to tell you.”“You’re being a nuisance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I said I just don’t care.” She snubs the maid once more.“They said it’s something to do with Mr. Coldmoon.” The maid tries tactfully to put this young vixen into a better humor.“I couldn’t care less if they want to talk about Coldmoon or Piddlemoon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I abominate that man with his daft face looking like a bewildered gourd.” Her third sour outburst is directed at the absent Coldmoon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Hello,” she suddenly goes on, “when did you start dressing your hair in the Western style?”The parlor-maid gulps and then replies as briefly as she can “Today.”“What sauce.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A mere parlor-maid, what’s more.” Her fourth attack comes in from a different direction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“And isn’t that a brand new collar you’ve got on?”“Yes, it’s the one you gave me recently.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve been keeping it in my box because it seemed too good for the likes of me, but my other collar became so grubby I thought I’d make the change.”“When did I give it you?”“It was January you bought it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
At Shirokiya’s.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s got the ranks of sumō wrestlers set out as decoration on the greeny-brown material.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You said it was too somber for your style.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So you gave it me.”“Did I?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, it certainly looks nice on you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How very provoking!”“I’m much obliged!”“I didn’t intend a compliment.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m very much put out.”“Yes, Miss.”“Why did you accept something which so very much becomes you without letting me know that it would?”“But Miss.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Since it looks that nice on you, it couldn’t fail, could it, to look more nice on me?”“I’m sure it would have looked delightful on you.”“Then why didn’t you say so?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Instead of that, you just stand there wearing it when you know I’d like it back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You little beast.” Her vituperations seem to have no end.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was wondering what would happen when, from the room at the other end of the house, old man Goldfield himself suddenly roared out for his daughter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Opula,” he bellowed.“Opula, come here.” She had no choice but to obey and mooched sulkily out of the room containing the telephone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her lapdog, slightly bigger than myself with its eyes and mouth all bunched together in the middle of its revolting mug, slopped along behind her.Thereupon, with my usual stealthy steps, I tiptoed back to the kitchen and, through the kitchen-door, found my way to the street, and so back home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My expedition has been notably successful.Coming thus suddenly from a beautiful mansion to our dirty little dwelling, I felt as though I had descended from a sunlit mountaintop to some dark dismal grot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Whilst on my spying mission.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d been far too busy to take any notice of the ornaments in the rooms, of the decoration of the sliding-doors and paper-windows or of any similar features, but as soon as I returned and became conscious of the shabbiness of home, I found myself yearning for what Waverhouse claims to despise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am inclined to think that, after all, there’s a good deal more to a businessman than there is to a teacher.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Uncertain of the soundness of this thinking, I consult my infallible tail.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The oracle confirms that my thinking is correct.I am surprised to find Waverhouse still sitting in my master’s room.His cigarette stubs, stuffed into the brazier, make it look like a beehive.Comfortably cross-legged on the floor, he is, as usual, talking.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It appears, moreover, that during my absence Coldmoon has dropped in.My master, his head pillowed on his arms, lies flat on his back rapt in contemplation of the pattern of the rainmarks on the ceiling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is another of those meetings of hermits in a peaceful reign.“Coldmoon, my dear fellow, I seem to remember that you insisted upon maintaining as the darkest of dark secrets the name of that young lady who called your name from the depths of her delirium.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But surely the time has now come when you could reveal her identity?”Waverhouse begins to niggle Coldmoon.“Were it just solely my concern, I wouldn’t mind telling you, but since any such disclosure might compromise the other party.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“So you still won’t tell?”“Besides, I promised the Doctor’s wife.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Promised never to tell anyone?”“Yes,” says Coldmoon back at his usual fiddling with the strings of his surcoat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The strings are a bright purple, objects of a color one could never nowadays find in any shop.“The color of those strings is early nineteenth century” remarks my supine master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He is genuinely quite indifferent to anything that concerns the Goldfields.“Quite.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It couldn’t possibly belong to these times of the Russo-Japanese War.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That kind of string would be appropriate only to the garments worn by the rank and file of soldiers under the Shogunate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is said that on the occasion of his marriage, nearly four hundred years ago, Oda Nobunaga dressed his hair back in the fashion of a tea whisk, and I have no doubt his projecting top-knot was bound with precisely such a string.” Waverhouse goes, as usual, all around the houses to make his little point.“As a matter of fact, my grandfather wore these strings at the time, not forty years back, when the Tokugawa were putting down the last rebellion before the restoration of the Emperor.” Coldmoon takes it all dead seriously.“Isn’t it then about time you presented those strings to a museum?For that well-known lecturer on the mechanics of hanging, that leading bachelor of science, Mr. Avalon Coldmoon to go around looking like a relic of mediaevalism would scarcely help his reputation.”“I myself would be only too ready to follow your advice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, there’s a certain person who says that these strings do specially become me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Who on earth could have made such an imperceptive comment?”asks my master in a loud voice as he rolls over onto his side.“A person not of your acquaintance.”“Never mind that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Who was it?”“A certain lady.”“Gracious me, what delicacy!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Shall I guess who it is?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I think it’s the lady who whimpered for you from the bottom of the Sumida River.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Why don’t you tie up your surcoat with those nice purple strings and go on out and get drowned again?” Waverhouse offers a helpful suggestion.Coldmoon laughs at the sally.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“As a matter of fact she no longer calls me from the riverbed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She is now, as it were, in the Pure Land, a little northwest from here.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Don’t hope for too much purity.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That ghastly nose looks singularly unwholesome.”“Eh?” says Coldmoon, looking puzzled.“The Archnose from over the way has just been round to see us.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yes, right here.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I can tell you we had quite a surprise.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hadn’t we, Sneaze?”“We had,” replies my master still lying on his side but now sipping tea.“Whom do you mean by the Archnose?”“We mean the honorable mother of your ever-darling lady.”“Oh!”“A woman calling herself Mrs. Goldfield came round here asking all sorts of questions about you.” My master, clarifying the situation, speaks quite seriously.I watch poor Coldmoon, wondering if he will be surprised or pleased or embarrassed, but in fact he looks exactly as he always does.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And in his accustomed quiet tones he comments “I suppose she’s asking if I’ll marry the daughter?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Was that it?” and he goes on twisting and untwisting his purple strings.“Far from it!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That mother happens to own the most enormous nose.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".” But before Waverhouse could finish his sentence my master interrupted him with a sudden irrelevance.“Listen,” he chirps, “I’ve been trying to compose a new-style haiku on that snout of hers.” Mrs. Sneaze begins to giggle in the next room.“You’re taking it all extremely lightly!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And have you composed your poem?”“I’ve made a start.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The first line goes ‘A Conker Festival takes place in this face.’”“And then?”“‘At which one offers sacred wine.’”“And the concluding line?”“I’ve not yet got to that.”“Interesting,” says Coldmoon with a grin.“How about this for the missing line?” improvises Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“‘Two orifices dim.’”Whereupon Coldmoon offers, “‘So deep no hairs appear.’”They were thus thoroughly enjoying themselves by proposing wilder and wilder lines when from the street beyond the hedge came the voices of several people shouting “Where’s that terra-cotta badger?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Come on out, you terra-cotta badger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Terra-cotta badger!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Yah!”Both my master and Waverhouse look somewhat startled and they peer out through the hedge.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Loud hoots of derisive laughter are followed by the sound of footsteps running away.“Whatever can they mean by a terra-cotta badger?”Waverhouse asks in puzzled tones.“I’ve no idea,” replies my master.“An unusual occurrence,” says Coldmoon.Waverhouse suddenly gets to his feet as if he had remembered something.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“For some several lustra,” he declaims in parody of the style of public lecturers, “I have devoted myself to the study of aesthetic nasofrontology and I would accordingly now like to trespass on your time and patience in order to present certain interim conclusions at which I have arrived.” His initiative has been so suddenly taken that my master just stares up at him in silent blank amazement.Coldmoon’s tiniest voice observes, “I’d love to hear your interim conclusions.”“Though I have made a thorough study of this matter, the origin of the nose remains, alas, still deeply obfuscated.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The first question that arises reflects the assumption that the nose is intended for use.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The functional approach.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If that premise is valid, would not two mere vent-holes meet the case?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There is no obvious need either for such arrogant profusion or for the nasal arrogation of a median position in the human physiognomy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why then should the nasal organ thus,” and he paused to pinch his own, “thrust itself forward?”“Yours doesn’t stick out much,” cuts in my master rather rudely.“At any rate it has no indentations, no incurvations; still less could it be described as countersunk or infundibular.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I draw your attention to these facts because if you fail to make the necessary distinction between having two holes in the medio-frontal area of the face and having two such holes in some form of protuberance, you will inevitably be unable to follow the quintessential drift of my dissertation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, it is at least my own, albeit humble, opinion that it is by an accumulation of human actions trifling in themselves, for who could attach major importance to the blowing of one’s nose, that the organ in question has developed into its present phenomenal form.”“How very humbly you do hold your humble views,” interjects my master.“As you will know, the act of blowing the nose involves the coarctation of that organ.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such stenosis of the nose, such astrictive and, one might even venture to say, pleonastic stimulation of so localized an area results, by response to that stimulus and in accordance with the well-established principles of Lamarckian evolutionary theory, in the development of that specific area to a degree disproportionate to the development of other areas.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The epidermis of the affected area inevitably indurates and the subcutaneous material so coagulates as eventually to ossify.”“That’s a bit extreme.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Surely you can’t turn flesh to bone just by blowing your nose.” Coldmoon, as behoves a bachelor of science, lodges a protest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse continues to deliver his speech with the utmost nonchalance.“I can well appreciate your natural dubieties, but the proof of the pudding is the eating.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For, behold, there is bone there, and that bone has demonstrably been molded.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, and despite that bone, one snivels.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one snivels one has to blow the nose, and in the course of that action both sides of the bone get worn away until the nose itself acquires the shape of a high and narrow bulge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is indeed a terrifying process.But just as little taps of dropping water will eventually bore through granite, so has the high, straight ridge of the nasal organ been smithied by incessant nose-blows.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus painfully was fangled the hard straight line on one’s face.”“But yours is flabby.”“I deliberately refrain from any discussion of this particular feature as it may be observed in the physiognomy of the lecturer himself; for such a purely personal approach involves the dangers of self-exculpation, the temptation to gloss over, even to defend, one’s individual defects or deficiencies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the nose of the honorable Mrs. Goldfield is such that I would wish to bring it to your attention as the most highly developed of its kind, the most egregiously rare object, in the world.”Coldmoon cries out in spontaneous admiration.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Hear, hear.”“But anything whatever that develops to an extreme degree becomes thereby intimidating.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even terrifying.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Spectacular it may be, but simultaneously awesome, unapproachable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus the bridge of that lady’s nose, though certainly magnificent, appears to me unduly rigid, unacceptably steep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one pauses to consider the nature of the noses of the ancients, it seems probable that those of Socrates, Oliver Goldsmith, and William Thackeray were strikingly imperfect from the structural point of view, but those very imperfections had their own peculiar charms.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This is, no doubt, the intellection behind the saying that a nose, like a mountain, is not significant because it is high but because it is odd.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Similarly, the popular catch-phrase that ‘dumplings are better than nosegays’ is no doubt a corruption of some yet more ancient adage to the effect that dumplings are better than noses.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From which it follows that, viewed aesthetically, the nose of Citizen Waverhouse is just about right.”Coldmoon and my master greet this fantastication with peals of appreciative laughter, and even Waverhouse joins in.“Now, the piece I have just been reciting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Distinguished speaker, I must object to your use of the phrase ‘reciting a piece’: a somewhat vulgar word one would only expect from a storyteller.” Coldmoon, catching Waverhouse in the use of language which only recently Waverhouse had criticized, feels himself revenged.“In which case, sir, and having with your gracious permission purged myself of error, I would now like to touch upon the matter of the proper proportion between the nose and its associated face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I were simply to discuss noses in disregard of their relation to other entities, then I would declare without fear of contradiction that the nose of Mrs.Goldfield is superb, superlative, and, though possibly supervacaneous, one well-placed to win first prize at any exhibition of nasal development which might be organized by the long-nosed goblins on Mount Kurama.But alas!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And even alack!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That nose appears to have been formed, fashioned, dare I say fabricated, without any regard for the configuration of such other major items as the eyes and mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Julius Caesar was undoubtedly dowered with a very fine nose.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But what do you think would be the result if one scissored off that Julian beak and fixed it on the face of this cat here?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Cats’ foreheads are proverbially diminutive.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
To raise the tower of Caesar’s boned proboscis on such a tiny site would be like plonking down on a chessboard the giant image of Buddha now to be seen at Nara.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The juxtaposing of disproportionate elements destroys aesthetic value.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mrs. Goldfield’s nose, like that of Caesar’s, is, as a thing in itself, a most dignified and majestic protuberance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But how does it appear in relation to its surroundings?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course those circumjacent areas are not quite so barren of aesthetic merit as the face of this cat.Nevertheless, it is a bloated face, the face of an epileptic skivvy whose eyebrows meet in a sharp-pitched gable above thin tilted eyes.Gentlemen, I ask you, what sort of nose could ever survive so lamentable a face?”As Waverhouse paused, a voice could be heard from the back of the house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“He’s still going on about noses.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What a spiteful bore he is.”“That’s the wife of the rickshaw-owner,” my master explains to Waverhouse.Waverhouse resumes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“It is a great, if unexpected, honor for this present lecturer to discover at, as it were, the back of the hall an interested listener of the gentle sex.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am especially gratified that a gleam of charm should be added to my arid lecture by the bell-sweet voice of this new participant.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, indeed, a happiness unlooked for, a serendipity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To be worthy of our beautiful lady’s patronage I would gladly alter the academic style of this discourse into a more popular mode, but, as I am just about to discuss a problem in mechanics, the unavoidably technical terminology may prove a trifle difficult for the ladies to comprehend.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I must therefore beg them to be patient.”Coldmoon responds to the mention of mechanics with his usual grin.“The point I wish to establish is that such a nose and such a face will never harmonize.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In brief, they cannot conform to Zeising’s rule of the Golden Section, a fact which I propose to prove by use of a mechanical formula.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We should first designate H as the height of the nose, and α as the angle between the nose and the level surface of the face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Please note that W is, of course, the weight of the nose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Are you with me thus far?”“Hardly,” breathes my master.“Coldmoon, what about you?”“I, too, am slightly at a loss.”“You distress me, Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze doesn’t matter, but I’m shocked that you, a bachelor of science, should fail to understand.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This formula is a key part of my lecture.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
To abandon this portion of my argument must render the whole endeavor pointless.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, such things can’t be helped.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ll omit the formula and merely deliver the peroration.”“Is there a peroration?” asks my master in genuine curiosity.“Why, naturally!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A lecture without a peroration is like a Western dinner shorn of the dessert.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, listen, both of you, carefully.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am launching on my peroration.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Gentlemen, if one reflects upon the theory which I have advanced on this occasion and gives due weight to the related theories of Virchow and of Wisemen, one is bound also to take appropriate account of the problem of the heredity of congenital form.Furthermore, though there is a substantial body of evidence to support the contention that acquired characteristics are not hereditarily transmissible, one cannot lightly dismiss the view that the mental conditions associated with hereditarily transmissible forms are themselves also transmissible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is consequently reasonable to assume that a child born to the possessor of a nose of such enormity will have an abnormal nose.Because Coldmoon is still young, he has not noticed any particular abnormality in the structure of Miss Goldfield’s nasal organ.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the genes lurk.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The products of heredity take long to incubate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One never knows.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps it would need no more than a sharp change of climate for the daughter’s snout suddenly to germinate and, in a mere instant, to tumesce into a replica of that of her most honorable mother.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In sum, I believe that in the light of my theoretical demonstration, it would seem prudent to forswear any idea of this marriage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, while it is still possible to do so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I would go so far as to claim that, quite apart from the master of this house, even his monstrous cat asleep among us, would not dissent my conclusions.”My master sits up at last.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Of course,” he says “no one in his senses would ever marry a daughter of that creature!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, my dear Coldmoon,” he insists in real earnest, “you simply must not marry her.”I seek in my own humble way to second all these sentiments by mewing twice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldmoon, however, does not seem to be particularly alarmed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“If you two sages share that opinion, I would be prepared to give her up, but it would be cruel if the consequent distress brought the person in question into poor health.”“That,” burbled Waverhouse happily, “might even be regarded as a sort of sex crime.”Only my master continues to take the matter seriously.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Don’t joke about such things.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That girl wouldn’t wither away, not if she’s the daughter of that forward and presumptuous creature who strove to humiliate me from the moment she set an uninvited foot in my house.” My master again works himself up into a great huff.At which point there is a further outbreak of laughter from, by the sound of it, three or four people on the far side of the hedge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A voice says, “You’re a stuck-up blockhead.” Another jeers, “I bet you’d like to live in a bigger house.”A third loud voice announces, “Ain’t it a pity!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You swagger around but you’re only a silly old windbag.”My master goes out on to the veranda and shouts with matching violence, “Hold your tongues.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What do you think you’re doing making this sort of disturbance so close to my property?”The laughter gets even louder.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Hark at him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s silly old Savage Tea.Savage Tea.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Savage Tea.”They set up an abusive chant.My master, looking furious, turns abruptly, snatches up his stick and rushes out into the street.Waverhouse claps his hands in pure delight.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Up guards and at ’em” he shouts, urging my master on.Coldmoon sits and grins, twisting his purple fastening-strings.I follow my master and, as I crawl out through a gap in the hedge, find him standing in the middle of the street with his stick held awkwardly in his hand.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Apart from him, the street is empty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I cannot help but feel that he’s been made to make a ninny of himself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
VOLUME IIIIT HAS become my usual practice to I sneak into the Goldfields’ mansion.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I won’t expand upon the meaning of my use of “usual,” which is merely a word expressing the square of “often.” What one does once, one wants to do again, and things tried twice invite a third experience.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

Why do human beings breathe smoke in through the mouth and then expel it through the nose?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since such shameless inhalation and exhalation can do little to ease the belly’s hunger and less to cure giddiness, I do not see why a race of habitual smokers should dare to offer criticism of my calls on the Goldfields.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Me, a detective?You must be out of your mind!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Among the several most degrading occupations in this world, there are, in my opinion, none more grubby than those of the detective and the money-lender.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is true that once, for Coldmoon’s sake, I displayed a chivalrous spirit unbecoming in a cat and kept an indirectly watchful eye on the Goldfields’ goings on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was but once that I acted with such ill-placed kind-heartedness, and since that isolated occasion I have done nothing whatsoever that could bring a twinge to the conscience of the most pernickety cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In which case, you may ask, why did I describe my own actions with such an unpleasantly suggestive phrase as “to sneak in?” I have my own good reasons, but their explanation involves analysis in depth.In the first place it is my opinion that the sky was made to shelter all creation, and that the earth was made so that all things created that were able to stand might have something to stand on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even those human beings who love argument for the arguing’s sake could surely not deny this fact.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Next we may ask to what extent did human effort contribute to the creation of heaven and earth, and the answer is that it contributed nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What right, then, do human beings hold to decide that things not of their own creation nevertheless belong to them?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course the absence of right need not prevent such creatures from making that decision, but surely there can be no possible justification for them prohibiting others from innocent passage in and out of so-called human property.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If it be accepted that Mr. So-and-so may set up stakes, fence off sections of this boundless earth, and register that area as his own, what is to prevent such persons from roping off blue sky, from staking claims on heaven, an enclosure of the air?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If natural law permitted proprietorial parceling-out of the land and its sale and purchase at so much the square foot, then it would also permit partition of the air we breathe at so much the cubic unit and its three-dimensional sale.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If, however, it is not proper to trade in sky, if enclosure of the empyrean is not regarded as just in natural law, then surely it must follow that all land-ownership is unnatural and irrational.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That, in fact, is my conviction, therefore I enter wherever I like.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Naturally, I do not go anywhere where I do not want to go: but, provided they are in the direction I fancy, all places are alike to me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I slope along as it suits me, and feel no inhibition about entering the properties of people like the Goldfields if I happen to want to.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, the sad fact is that, being no more than a cat, I cannot match mankind in the crude matter of simple physical strength.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In this real world the saying that “might is right” has very real force; so much so that no matter how sound my arguments may be, the logic of cats will not command respect.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Were I to press the argument too far, I should be answered, like Rickshaw Blacky, with a swipe from a fishmonger’s pole.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In situations where reason and brute force are opposed and one may choose either to submit by a perversion of reason or to achieve one’s reasonable ends by outwitting the opposition, I would, of course, adopt the latter course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one is not to be maimed with bamboo poles, one must put up with things: one must press on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, since the concept of trespass is irrational, and since “sneaking in” is only a form of “pressing on,” I am prepared to describe my visits as sneaking in.Though I have no wish whatsoever to spy upon the Goldfields, inevitably, as the number of my visits mount, I get to know things about that family which I’d rather not have known and I see happenings which, willy-nilly, I cannot purge from my memory.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am, for instance, regretfully aware that when Madam Conk dabs water on her face she wipes her nose with inordinate care; that Miss Opula persistently gluts herself on rice-cakes dusted with bean-flour; and that old man Goldfield, in striking contrast with his wife, has a nose as flat as a pancake.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, not just his nose, but his whole face is flat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is a face so leveled one suspects that when he was a lad he must have got into a fight with the strong boy of some children’s gang who, grabbing him by the scruff of the neck, rammed his face so hard against a plaster wall that even now, forty years on, his squashed and crumpled features are a living memento of that unlucky day.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though it is certainly an extremely peaceful, even a harmless, face, it is somewhat lacking in variety.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However much that face becomes infuriated, still it stays flat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I came to learn, moreover, that old man Goldfield likes tuna fish, sliced and raw, and that whenever he eats that delicacy, he pats himself on his own bald pate with a plashy, pattering sound.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Further, because his body is as squat as his face is flat, he affects tall hats and high-stepped wooden clogs; facts which his personal rickshawman finds so vastly entertaining that he’s always yattering on about them to the houseboy who, for his part, finds such sharp accuracy of observation impressively remarkable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I could go on forever with such details of the Goldfields’ goings-on.It has become my practice to enter the garden by the back-gate and to survey the lie of the land from the cover of a small artificial mound helpfully constructed there for decorative purposes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having made sure that everything is quiet and that all the paper-windows are slid shut, I gingerly creep forward and hop up onto the veranda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if I hear lively voices or consider there’s a risk that I might be seen from within, I mosey off eastward around the pond, nip past the lavatory and finish up, safe and unobserved, under the veranda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My conscience is in no way troubled, I’ve nothing to hide and no reason to be scared of anything whatsoever, but I’ve learnt what to expect if one should have the vile ill-luck to run up against one of those lawless and disorderly bipeds.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Were the human world cram-jammed with robber-toughs as violent as that long-departed villain, Kumasaka Chōhan, then even the most illustrious and virtuous of men would act as cautiously as I do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Inasmuch, as old man Goldfield is a dignified sort of businessman, I wouldn’t expect him to come after me with any such dirty great sword, five feet, three inches of it they tell me, as Kumasaka was wont to brandish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, from what I’ve seen and heard, Goldfield has his own unpleasant quirks and is certainly not disposed to accept that a man’s a man for a’ that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If Goldfield is overbearing with his fellowmen, how would he treat a cat?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A cat, as I keep on saying, is also a cat for a’ that, but given Goldfield’s nature, even a feline of the most upright virtues would be wise to adopt a low posture and a very cautious attitude once inside the Goldfield premises.This very need to be constantly on the qui vive is, I find, delightful, and my taste for danger explains why I make these frequent risky visits.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I will give further and careful thought to this fascinating point and, when I have completed my analysis of cat-mentality, I will publish the results.What’s up today, I wonder, as I settle my chin against the grass on top of the garden-hillock and survey the prospect spread below me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The doors of their ample drawing room are open wide to the full spring day and I can see, inside, the Goldfields busily engaged in conversation with a guest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am somewhat daunted by the fact that Madam Conk’s proboscis is pointed directly in my direction: it glares across the pond straight at my unprotected forehead.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This is my first experience of being glared at by a nose.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Facing his guest, old man Goldfield presents himself to my gaze in full profile.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My eyes are spared one half of his flattened features but, for the same profilic reason, the location of his nose is indeterminable, and it is only because one can see where his grayish-white moustache sprouts raggedly from the flesh that one can deduce that the vent-holes of his nostrils must be gaping closely thereabove.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I amuse myself with the reflection that the light spring breeze might well blow on forever if it encountered no more formidable obstruction than that jutless physiognomy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of the three, the Goldfields’ guest has the most normal features but, precisely because of their regularity, there’s no facial peculiarity I see reason to point out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For anything to be regular suggests that the thing’s all right, but regularity can be so utterly regular as to become, by its very ulteriority, mediocre and of no account, which is extremely pitiable.I wonder who he is, this unfortunate fellow fated to be born in this glorious reign behind so meaningless a phiz.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My curiosity can’t be satisfied unless I crawl more close and, in my accustomed manner, establish myself underneath the veranda and listen to what is said.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So under it I go.“.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".and my wife actually took the trouble to call on the man to ask for information.”As usual, old man Goldfield speaks in an arrogant manner.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The manner is certainly prideful, but his voice contains no hint of sharpness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It gives, like his face, an impression of massive flatness.“I see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So he’s the fellow who used to teach your Mr. Avalon Coldmoon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I see, I see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yes, yours is a good idea.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I see.” This guest is positively overflowing with “I see’s.”“But somehow my wife’s approaches all proved pretty pointless.”“No wonder.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sneaze is not strong on point.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even in the days when he and I shared digs and looked after ourselves, his lack of point, his lack of resolution, were painfully extreme.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You must,” he said, turning to Madam Conk, “have had a difficult time.”“Difficult!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s hardly the word.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Never in my life have I made a visit and been so badly treated.” As is her ugly custom, Madam Conk snorts storm-winds down her snout.“Did he say anything rude to you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s always been obstinate, a real old stick-in-the-mud.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s been teaching that English Reader for years without a break, so you can imagine.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.” With what charm and tact this guest is making himself agreeable.“He is beyond help.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I understand that every time my wife asked a question, she received a blunt rebuff.”“What impudence!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I see it, persons of some small education tend to grow conceited and, if they happen also to be poor, their characters become as bitter as sour grapes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, some people in that condition turn truly quite absurd.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For no reason at all, they flare up at persons of wealth as if unconscious of their own total ineffectiveness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s quite astonishing how they behave; as if the rich had robbed them personally of things they never owned.”The guest’s laughter rang out affectedly, but he certainly seems delighted with himself.“Scandalous behavior!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s because they know nothing of the world that they carry on so outrageously.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So I thought I’d have him taken down a peg or two.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s time he learned how many beans make six.”“I see.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Splendid.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That should have shaken him up a bit.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Done him no end of good.” Goldfield is smothered in his guest’s congratulations, even though that sycophant still lacks the least idea of the kind of rod which Goldfield’s put in pickle for poor Sneeze.“But really, Mr. Suzuki, Sneaze is impossible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"D’you know,” said Madam Conk, “down at his school he won’t exchange two words with our friend, Mr. Fukuchi?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nor, come to think of it, with Mr. Tsuki either.We’d thought he’d learnt his lesson and was keeping quiet because he knew he’s been sat on, but, would you believe it, only the other day we heard he’d been chasing after our harmless houseboy with a walking stick!Just imagine that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s a man of thirty.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No sane grown-up could act in such a way.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps,” she ended hopefully, “despair has driven him dotty.”“But what can have driven him to such an act of violence?”Their guest seems mystified that Sneaze could act so firmly.“Nothing much really.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It seems that our houseboy happened to be passing Sneaze’s place, made some innocent remark, and, before you could say Jack Robinson, Sneaze came rushing out in his bare feet and began lashing around with his stick.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whatever the houseboy may have said, he is, after all, no more than a boy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But Sneaze is a bearded man and, what’s more, supposed to be a teacher.”“Some teacher,” says the guest.“Some teacher,” echoed Goldfield.It would seem that this precious trio has reached complete agreement that, if one happens to be a teacher, one should, like some wooden statue, grin and bear whatever insults anyone cares to offer.“And then,” said Madam Conk, “there’s that fibbing crank called Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve never heard a man tell such a stream of whoppers.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All quite pointless, but all f lat lies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, I’ve never clapped eyes on such a loony in my life.”“Waverhouse?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yes, he seems to be bragging on as usual.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Was he also there when you called on Sneaze?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He, too, can be a tricky customer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He was another of our group in digs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I remember I was always having rows with him on account of his incessant, ill-judged mockery and his warped sense of humor.”“A man like that would rile a saint.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We all, of course, tell lies, sometimes out of loyalty, sometimes by demand of the occasion, and in such circumstances anyone may fairly bend the truth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But that man Waverhouse tells his lies for no good reason at all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What can one do with a man like that?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I just can’t see how he brings himself to rattle off such reams of barefaced balderdash.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What does he expect to gain by it?”“You’ve hit the nail on the head.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s nothing one can do when a man tells lies for a hobby.”“I made a special visit to that miserable house to ask no more than the normal questions about Avalon that any mother would, but all my efforts came to nothing; they vexed me and they put me down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But all the same, I felt obliged to do the decent thing, so afterward I sent our rickshawman around with a dozen bottles of beer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can you imagine what happened?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That saucy usher Sneaze had the cheek to order our man to take the bottles away because, so he said, he saw no reason why he should accept them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Our fellow pressed him to take the bottles as a token of our appreciation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So then Sneaze said that he liked jam but reckoned beer too bitter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then he just shut the door and went off back to his room.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now can you beat that?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How damned rude can one get?”“That’s terrible.” The guest seems, this time genuinely, to think it’s really terrible.After a brief pause I hear the voice of old man Goldfield.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“And that’s, in fact, precisely why we’ve asked you here today.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s something, of course, to make fun of that fool Sneaze behind his back, but that sort of thing doesn’t entirely suit our present purpose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".” Splash, spatter; spatter, spatter, splash.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s patting his pate as though he’s just been eating sliced, raw tuna fish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, being tucked away underneath the veranda, I cannot actually see him beating that wet tattoo on the skin of his hairless head, but I’ve seen so much of him lately that, just as a priestess in a temple gets to recognize the sound of each particular wooden gong, so I can tell, from the quality of the sound, even though I’m under the floor, when old man Goldfield takes to drumming on his skull.“And it occurred to me to ask for your assistance in this matter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“If I can be of any service, please don’t hesitate to ask me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After all, it’s entirely due to your kind influence that I have had the great good fortune to be transferred to the Tokyo office.” Their guest is so obviously anxious to oblige that he must be another of those many persons under obligation to return some form of help to Goldfield.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, well, so the plot thickens.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I wandered out today simply because the weather was so wonderful, and I certainly had not expected to stumble upon such exciting news of planned skulduggery.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is as though one had gone to the family temple dutifully intending to feed the Hungry Dead, only to find oneself invited to a right old lash-up of rice-cake dumplings and bean-paste jam in the private room of a priest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Wondering what kind of assistance will be sought from this client-guest, I prick my ears to listen.“Don’t ask me to explain it, but that nitwitted teacher keeps planting crazy notions in the head of young Coldmoon: like, for instance, hinting that he shouldn’t marry any daughter of mine.” He turned to his wife.“That’s what he hinted, didn’t he?”“Hinting’s not the word.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He said flat out ‘No one in his senses would ever marry a daughter of that creature.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldmoon,’ he said,‘you simply mustn’t marry her.’”“Well, blow me down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Did he really have, the brazen cheek to speak of me as a creature?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Did he really pitch it as strong as that?”“Not half he didn’t.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The wife of the rickshaw-man came around double-quick just to be sure I knew.”“Well, there you are, Suzuki.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That man Sneaze is getting to be a nuisance, wouldn’t you agree?”“How extremely irritating.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Marriage negotiations are not matters in which to meddle lightly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Surely even a dunderhead like Sneaze ought to have the common sense to know that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, the whole thing’s beyond my comprehension.”“In your undergraduate days you lived in the same boarding-house as Sneaze, and, though things may have changed by now, I understand that you two then used to be pretty pally.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, what I want you to do is to go and see Sneaze and try to talk some reason into him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He may be feeling offended, but if he is, it’s really all his own fool fault.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he plays ball, I’d be willing to give him generous help with his personal affairs, and we would, of course, lay off annoying him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if he keeps on gumming things up the way he’s so far done, it will only be natural if I find ways of my own to settle his meddlesome hash.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In short, it just won’t pay him to go on acting obstinate.”“How very right you are.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Continued resistance on his part would be idiotic.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It could bring him no possible profit and could well cause him loss.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ll do my best to make him understand.”“One more thing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since there are many other suitors for our daughter, I can’t make any firm promise of giving her to Coldmoon, but you could usefully go so far as to hint that, if he studies hard and gets his degree in the near future, he stands a chance of winning her.”“That should encourage him to buckle down to study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All right, I’ll do as you wish.”“One last thing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It may sound odd, but what especially sticks in my gullet is the way that Coldmoon, who’s supposed to be so smart, laps up everything that Sneaze lets drop, and even goes around addressing that crack-brained ninny as though he were some kind of sage professor.Of course, since Coldmoon’s not the only man we are considering for Opula, such unbecoming conduct is not of vast importance.Nevertheless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“You see,” squawked Madam Conk, butting in on her husband’s careful sentence, “it’s just that we’re sorry for Coldmoon.”“I’ve never had the pleasure of meeting the gentleman, but, since to marry into your distinguished family would be to ensure a lifetime’s happiness, I’m quite convinced that he himself could not possibly wish other than the marriage.”“You’re absolutely right,” said Madam Conk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Coldmoon’s keen to marry her.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s only that numbskull Sneaze and his crackpot crony Waverhouse who keep throwing spanners in the works.”“Most reprehensible.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not the style of behavior one expects from any reasonable, well-educated person.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ll go and talk with Sneaze.”“Please do, we’d be most grateful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Remember, too, that Sneaze knows better than anyone else what Coldmoon’s really like.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As you know, during her recent call my wife failed to dig out anything much worth knowing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If in addition to ascertaining details of his scholastic talent and all that stuff, you could also find out more about Coldmoon’s character and conduct, I’d be particularly obliged.”“Certainly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since it’s Saturday today, Sneaze must be home by now.Where does he live, I wonder,” says Suzuki.“You turn right from our place, then turn left at the end of the road.About one block along, you’ll see a house with a tumbled down black fence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That,” said Madam Conk, “is it.”“So it’s right here in this neighborhood!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then it should be easy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ll go and see him on my way home.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It will be simple to identify the house by the name plate.”“You may, or you may not, find his name plate on display.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I understand he uses one or two grains of cooked rice to stick his visiting card on his wooden gate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When it rains, of course, the cardboard comes unstuck.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then on some convenient sunny day he’ll paste another card in place.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So you can’t be sure that his name plate will be up.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s hard to see why he keeps to such a trouble some routine when the obvious thing to do is to hang up a wooden name board.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But that,” sighed Madam Conk, “is just another example of his general cussedness.”“Astonishing,” remarked Suzuki, “but I’ll find the place in any case by asking for the house with the black fence in a state of disrepair.”“Oh yes, you’ll find it easily enough.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s not another house in the whole neighborhood quite so filthy-looking.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Wait a minute!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve just remembered something else.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Look for a house with weeds growing out of the roof.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s impossible to miss.”“In fact, a quite distinguished residence,” said Suzuki and, laughing, took his leave.It would not suit my book to have Suzuki beat me home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve already overheard as much as I need to know; so, still concealed beneath the veranda, I retrace my steps to the lavatory where, turning west, I briefly break cover to get back behind the hillock and, under its concealment, regain the safety of the street.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A brisk cattrot soon brings me to the house with the weed-grown roof where, with the utmost nonchalance, I hopped up onto our own veranda.My master had spread a white woolen blanket on the wooden boards and was lying there, face down, with the sunshine of this warm spring day soaking into his back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sunshine, unlike other things, is distributed fairly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It falls impartially upon the rich and the poor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It makes a squalid hut, whose only distinctions are the tufts of shepherd’s purse sprouting from its roof, no less gaily warm than, for all its solid comfort, the Goldfields’ mansion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am, however, obliged to confess that that blanket jars with the day’s spring feeling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No doubt its manufacturer meant that it should be white.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No doubt, too, it was sold as white by some haberdasher specializing in goods imported from abroad.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No less certainly, my master must have asked for a white blanket at the time he bought it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But all that happened twelve or thirteen years ago, and since that far-off Age of White, the blanket has declined into a Dark Age where its present color is a somber gray.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No doubt the passage of time will eventually turn it black, but I’d be surprised if the thing survived that long.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is already so badly worn that one can easily count the individual threads of its warp and woof.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Its wooliness is gone and it would be an exaggeration, even a presumption, to describe this scrawny half-eroded object as a blanket.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A “blan,” possibly; even a “ket,” but a full-blown “blanket,” no.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, my master holds, or at least appears to hold, that anything which one has kept for a year, two years, five years, and eventually for a decade, must then be kept for the rest of one’s natural life.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One would think he were a gypsy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, what’s he doing, sprawled belly-down on that remnant of the past?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He lies with his chin stuck out, its jut supported on a crotch of hands, with a lighted cigarette projecting from his right-hand fingers.And that is all he’s doing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course inside his skull, deep below the dandruff, universal truths may be spinning around in a shower of fiery sparks like so many Catherine Wheels.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s possible but, judging from his external appearance, not likely even in one’s wildest imaginings.The cigarette’s lit tip is steadily burning down and an inch of ash, like some gray caddis-case, plopped down onto the blanket.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, ignoring that declension, stares intently at the rising smoke.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Stirred by the light spring breeze, the smoke floats up in loops and vortices, finally to gather in a kind of clinging haze around the ends of his wife’s just-washed black hair.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Gentle reader, please accept my apologies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I had completely forgotten to mention that lady’s presence.Mrs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sneaze is sitting so that her bottom presents itself before her husband’s face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You think that impolite?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Speaking for myself I would not call it so.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Both courtesy and discourtesy depend on one’s point of view.My master is lying perfectly at ease with his cupped face in close proximity to his wife’s bottom: he is neither disturbed by its proximity nor concerned at his own conduct.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His wife is equally composed to position her majestic bum bang in her husband’s face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There is neither the slightest hint nor intention of discourtesy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They are simply a much-married couple who, in less than a year of wedlock, sensibly disengaged themselves from the cramps of etiquette.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Mrs. Sneaze seems to have taken advantage of the exceptionally fine weather to give her pitch-black hair a really thorough wash with a concoction made from raw eggs and some special kind of seaweed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Somewhat ostentatiously, she has let her long straight hair hang loose around her shoulders and all the way down her back, and sits, busy and silent, sewing a child’s sleeveless jacket.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In point of fact, I believe it is purely because she wants to dry her hair that she’s brought both her sewing-box and a flattish cushion made from some all-woolen muslin out here.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is similarly to present her hair at the best angle to the sun that, deferentially, she presents her bottom to her spouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That’s my belief, but it may, of course, be that my master moved to intrude his face where her bum already was.Now, to return to that business of the cigarette smoke, my master lay watching with fascinated absorption the way in which the smoke, floating upward through his wife’s abundant and now loosened hair, was itself combed into an appearance of filaments of blue-gray air.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, it is in the nature of smoke to go on rising, so that my master’s fascination with this singular spectacle of hair-entangled smoke compels him, lest he miss any phase of its development, steadily to lift his gaze.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His eyes, first leveled on her hips, move up her back, over her shoulders, and along her neck.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And it was after his concentrated stare had completed the ascent of her neck and was focused on the very crown of her head that he suddenly let out an involuntary gasp of surprise.For there, on the very summit of the lady whom he had promised to love and cherish till death did them part, was a large round patch of baldness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That unexpected nakedness, catching the clear spring sunshine, threw back the light and shone with an almost braggart self-confidence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master’s eyes remain fixed open in surprise at this dazzling discovery and, disregarding the danger of such brightness to his own uncovered retinal tissue, he continues to goggle at her skin’s bright mirror.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The image that then immediately shot into my master’s mind was of that dish on which stood the taper set before the altar in the household shrine handed down in his family for untold generations.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master’s family belongs to the Shin sect of Buddhism, a sect in which it is the established custom to lay out substantial sums, more indeed than most of its adherents can afford, on household shrines.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master suddenly remembers how, when he was a very small boy, he first saw the shrine in the family safe-room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was a miniature shrine, somber though thickly gilded, in which a brass taper-dish was hanging.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From the burning taper a faint light shone, even in the day time, on the rounded dish.Bright against the shrine’s general darkness, that image of the shining dish, seen in his childhood time and time again, leapt back into his mind as he gaped at his wife’s bald patch.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But that first remembrance quickly vanished, to be replaced by memories of the pigeons at the Kannon Temple in Asakusa.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There seems no obvious connection between temple doves and Mrs. Sneaze’s gleaming scalp, but in my master’s mind the association of images is clear and very close.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It, again, is an association deriving from his early childhood.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whenever then he was taken to that temple, he would buy peas for the pigeons.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The peas cost less than a farthing a saucer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The saucers, made of an unglazed reddish clay, were remarkably similar, both in size and color, to his wife’s bare patch.“Astonishingly similar.” The words escape from his lips in tones of an awed wonder.“What is?” says his wife without even turning toward him.“What is?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s a big bald patch on the crown of your head.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Did you know?”“Yes,” she answers, still not interrupting her sewing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She seems not the least embarrassed by his discovery.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A model wife, at least in point of imperturbability.“Was it there before we married or did it crop up later?”Though my master does not come out with an open accusation, he clearly sounds as if he would regard himself as having been tricked into marriage if the bald patch was, in fact, present in her maidenhood.“I don’t remember when I got it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not that it matters.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whatever difference could a bald patch make?” Quite the philosopher, isn’t she just.“Not that it matters!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But it’s your own hair that we’re talking about.”My master speaks with a certain sharpness.“It’s just because it is my own hair that it doesn’t matter.” An effective answer, but she may have been feeling slightly self-conscious for she lifted her right hand gently to stroke the spot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Oh dear,” she said, “it’s got much bigger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I hadn’t realized that.” Her tone conceded that the patch was larger than would be normal at her age and, now driven onto the defensive, she added, “Once one starts doing one’s hair in the married style, the strands at the crown come under a very real strain.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All married women lose hair from the top of the head.”“If all married women lost hair at your rate, by the time they were forty they’d be bald as kettles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You must have caught some kind of disease.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Maybe it’s contagious.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’d better go round and have it looked at by Dr. Amaki before things go too far,” says my master, carefully stroking his own head.“That’s all very well, but what about you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
White hairs in your nostrils!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If baldness is contagious, white hairs will be catching.” Mrs. Sneaze begins to go over to the attack.“A single, white hair in the nostrils is obviously harmless, and it doesn’t even show.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But fox-mange on the crown of the head cannot be ignored.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, especially in the case of a young woman, positively unsightly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s a deformity.”“If you think I’m deformed, why did you marry me?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was you who wanted the marriage, yet now you call me deformed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“For the simple reason that I didn’t know.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I was unaware of your condition until this very day.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you want to make an issue of it, why didn’t you reveal your naked scalp to me before we got married?”“What a silly thing to say!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Where in the world would you find a place where girls had to have their scalps examined before they could get married?”“Well, the baldness might be tolerable but you’re also uncommonly dumpy, and that is certainly unsightly.”“There’s never been anything hidden about my height.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You knew perfectly well when you married me that I’m slightly on the short side.”“Of course I knew, but I’d thought you might extend a bit, and that’s why I married you.”“How could anyone grow taller after the age of twenty?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Are you trying to make a fool of me?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Eh?” She drops the sleeveless jacket and, twisting around to face her husband, gives him a threatening look as if to say,“Now watch your step, you go too far, and you’ll be sorry.”“There is surely no law forbidding people from growing taller after the age of twenty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I cherished a faint hope that, if I fed you up on decent food, you might prolong yourself.” With every appearance of meaning what he said, my master was about to develop his curious reasoning, when he was cut off by a sharp ringing of the doorbell followed by a loud shout of “Hello.” Snuffling after the scent of that shepherd’s purse on the roof, the dogged Suzuki seems at last to have tracked down Sneaze’s den.My master’s wife, temporarily postponing their domestic row, snatches up the jacket and her sewing-box and vanishes into an inner room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master scrabbles his gray blanket up into a ball and slings it into the study.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The maid brings in the visitor’s card and gives it to my master, who, having read it, looks a little surprised.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, having told the maid to show the visitor in, he goes off into the lavatory with the card still clasped in his hand.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If it is beyond one’s comprehension that he should thus suddenly take to the loo, it is even more difficult to explain why he should have taken with him the visiting-card of Suzuki Tōjūrō.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, in any case, very hard luck on the soul of that visiting-card that it should have to accompany him to that noisome place.The maid deposits a printed, cotton cushion on the floor in front of the alcove-recess, invites the guest to be seated in that place of honor, and then removes herself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Suzuki first inspects the room.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He begins by examining the scroll displayed in the alcove: its Chinese characters, allegedly written by Mokuan, that master calligrapher of the Zen sect, are, of course, faked, but they state that flowers are in bloom and that spring is come to all the world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He next tarns his attention to some early-flowering cherry-blossoms arranged in one of those celadon vases which they turn out cheap in Kyoto.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, when his roving glance chances to fall upon the cushion provided for his particular convenience, what should he find but, planted serenely smack in its center, a squatting cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I need hardly add that the cat in question is my lordly self.It was at this point that the first quick tremor of tension, a ripple so small it did not show on his face, quaked in Suzuki’s mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That cushion had undoubtedly been provided for himself but before he could sit down on it, some strange animal, without so much as a by-your-leave, had dispossessed him of the seat of honor and now lay crouched upon it with an air of firm self-confidence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This was the first consideration to disturb the composure of his mind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In point of fact, had the cushion remained unoccupied, Suzuki would probably have sought to demonstrate his modesty by resting his rump on the hard matfloor until such time as my master himself invited its transfer to the comfort of the cushion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So who the hell is this that has so blithely appropriated the cushion which was destined, sooner or later, to have eased Suzuki buttocks?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Had the interloper been a human being, he might well have given way.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But to be pre-empted by a mere cat, that is intolerable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is also a little unpleasant.This minor animality of his dissedation was the second consideration to disturb the composure of Suzuki’s mind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There was, moreover, something singularly irritating about the very attitude of the cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Without the least small twitch-sign of apology, the cat sits arrogantly on the cushion it has filched and, with a cold glitter in its unamiable eyes, stares up into Suzuki’s face as if to say, “And who the hell are you?” This is the third consideration to ruffle Suzuki’s composure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course if he’s really irked, he ought to jerk me off the cushion by the scruff of my neck.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But he doesn’t.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He just watches me in silence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is inconceivable that any creature as massive and muscular as man could be so afraid of a cat as not to dare to bring crude force to bear in any clash of wills.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So why doesn’t Suzuki express his dislike by turfing me off the cushion with summary dispatch?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The reason is, I think, that Suzuki is inhibited by his own conception of the conduct proper to a man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When it comes to the use of force any child three feet tall can, and will, fling me about quite easily.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But a full-grown man, even Suzuki Tōjūrō, Goldfield’s right-hand man, cannot bring himself to raise a finger against this Supreme Cat Deity ensconced upon the holy ground of a cotton cushion two feet square.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even though there were no witnesses, a man would regard it as beneath his dignity to scuffle with a cat for possession of a cushion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One would make oneself ridiculous, even a figure of farce, if one degraded oneself to the level of arguing with a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For Suzuki, the price of this human estimate of human dignity is to endure a certain amount of discomfort in the nates, but precisely because he feels he must endure it, his hatred of the cat is proportionately increased.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When, every now and again he looks at me, his face exudes distaste.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since I find it amusing to see such wry distortion of his features, I do my best myself to maintain an air of innocence and resist the temptation to laugh.While this pantomime was still going on, my master left the lavatory and, having tidied himself up, came in and sat down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Hello,” he said.Since the visiting card is no longer in his hand, the name of Suzuki Tōjūrō must have been condemned to penal servitude for life in that evil-smelling place.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Almost before I could feel sorry for the visiting card’s ill-luck, my master, saying, “Oh, you!” grabs me by the scruff of my neck and hurls me out to land with a bang on the veranda.“Do take this cushion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’re quite a stranger.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When did you come up to Tokyo?” My master offers the cushion to his old friend, and Suzuki, having turned it catside-down, dumps himself upon it.“As I’ve been so busy I haven’t let you know, but I was recently transferred back to our main office in Tokyo.”“That’s splendid.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We haven’t seen each other for quite a long while.This must be the first time since you went off to the provinces?”“Yes, nearly ten years ago.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Actually, I did sometimes come up to Tokyo, but as I was always flooded with business commitments, I simply couldn’t manage to get round to see you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I do hope you won’t think too badly of me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, unlike your own profession, a business firm is honestly very busy.”“Ten years make big changes,” observes my master, looking Suzuki up and down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His hair is neatly parted.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He wears an English-made tweed suit enlivened by a gaudy tie.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A bright gold watch chain glitters from his waistcoat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All these sartorial touches make it hard to credit that this can really be one of Sneaze’s friends.“Well, one gets on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I’m now virtually obliged to sport such things as this.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.” Suzuki seems a little self-conscious about the vulgarly fashionable display of his watch chain.“Is that thing real?” My master poses his question with the minimum of tact.“Solid gold.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Eighteen carat,” Suzuki answers, smilingly smug.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“You, too,” he continued, “seem to have aged.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Am I right in thinking you’ve children now?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Am I right?”“No.”“Two?”“No.”“What, more?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Three, then, is it?”“Yes, I have three children now, and I don’t know how many more to come in the future.”“Still as whimsical as ever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How old is your eldest?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quite big, I suppose.”“Yes, I’m not quite sure how old, but probably six or seven.”Suzuki laughed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“It must be pleasant to be a teacher, everything so free and easy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wish I too had taken up teaching.”“Just you try.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’d be sorry in three days.”“I don’t know.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It seems a good kind of life: refined and not too stressful, plenty of spare time, and the opportunity to really study one’s own special interest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being a businessman is not bad, either, though at my present level things aren’t particularly satisfactory.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one becomes a businessman, one has to get to the top.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anywhere lower on the ladder, you have to go around spouting idiotic flatteries and drinking saké with the boss when there’s nothing you want less.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Altogether, it’s a stupid way of life.”“Ever since my school days I’ve always taken a scunner to businessmen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They’ll do anything for money.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They are, after all, what they used to be called in the good old days: the very dregs of society.” My master, with a businessman right there in front of him, indulges in tactlessness.“Oh, have a heart.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They aren’t always like that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Admittedly, there’s a certain coarseness about them; for there’s no point in even trying to be a businessman unless your love for money is so absolute that you’re ready to accompany it on the walk to a double suicide.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For money, believe you me, is a hard mistress and none of her lovers are let off lightly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As a matter of fact, I’ve just been visiting a businessman and, according to him, the only way to succeed is to practice the ‘triangled technique’: try to escape your obligations, annihilate your kindly feelings, and geld yourself of the sense of shame.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Try-an-geld.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You get it?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Jolly clever, don’t you think?”“What awful fathead told you that?”“He’s no fathead.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Smart as a whip, in fact.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And increasingly respected in business circles.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I rather fancy you know him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He lives up a side street just around the corner.”“You mean that frightful Goldfield?”“Goodness me, but you’re really getting worked up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He only meant it, you know, as a kind of joke.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s simply a way of summarizing the fact that to make money one must go through hell.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So please don’t take a joke too seriously.”“His ‘triangled technique’ may, I grant, be a joke: let’s say it’s screamingly funny.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But what about his wife and her nauseating nose?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you’ve been to their house you could hardly have avoided colliding with that beak.”“Ah, Mrs. Goldfield.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She seems a sensible woman of broad understanding.”“Damn her understanding.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m talking about her nose.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her nose, Suzuki, it’s a positive monstrosity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only the other day I composed a haitai poem about it.”“What the dickens is a haitai poem?”“Do you mean to say you’ve never heard of the current experiments in the composition of extended haiku?You do seem cut off from what’s going on in the world.”“True.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When one is as busy as I am, it’s absolutely impossible to keep up with things like literature.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, even when a lad, I never liked it much.”“Are you aware of the shape of Charlemagne’s nose?”“You are indeed in a whimsical mood.” Suzuki laughed quite naturally.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Of course I haven’t the faintest idea of the shape of Charlemagne’s nose.”“Well, what about Wellington then?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"By the way, I dropped in today because there’s something I’d like to ask you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s about a chap you used to teach.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Avalon something or other.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I can’t remember his other name, but I understand that you and he see a lot of each other.”“You mean Coldmoon?”“That’s it, Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"She said she’d paid a visit in order to present her respects to Mr. Sneaze and to entreat his assistance in a matter of information, but that Waverhouse was present and made so many and such frivolous interruptions that she just got muddled.”“It was all her own fault.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Coming round here with a nose like that.”“She spoke of you with the deepest respect.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She’s just regretful that the performance put on by Waverhouse made it impossible to ask you certain personal questions about Coldmoon, and she has therefore asked me to speak on her behalf.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For what it’s worth, I’ve never before played the part of an honest broker in matters of this sort, but if the two parties most directly concerned are not against the idea, it’s not a bad thing to serve as a go-between and so bring about a marriage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, that’s the reason for my present visit.”“How kind of you to call,” commented my master somewhat acidly.But, though he could not explain his feeling, he was inwardly a little moved by that phrase about “the two parties most directly concerned.”Its slightly sentimental appeal made him feel as though a wraith of cool air had drifted through his sleeves on a hot and humid summer’s night.It is true that my master’s character is based on so firm an inborn bedrock of cold reserve and obstinacy that he is, by nature, one of this world’s wet blankets.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, his nature is of a completely different type from that of the vicious, heartless products of modern civilization.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The antique mold of his nature is clearly evidenced in the way in which he flares up at the slightest provocation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The sole reason for his barney with Madam Conk was that he could not stand her modern-day approach.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But his flat dislike of the mother was no fault of her daughter.Similarly, because he abominates all businessmen, he finds Goldfield acutely distasteful: yet here again, no blame can be laid on the daughter.Sneaze bears no real ill-will toward her, and Coldmoon is his favorite pupil and he loves that lad more deeply than he would a brother.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If Suzuki is correct in his statement that the two parties most directly concerned do, in fact, love each other, then it would be an act unworthy of a gentleman even indirectly to hinder true love’s course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze is quite convinced that he himself is a gentleman, so his only remaining question is whether Coldmoon and Miss Goldfield are in love.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He must, if he is to amend his attitude, first be sure of the facts.“Tell me, does that girl really want to marry Coldmoon?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"well, yes, I suppose she does.” Suzuki’s answer is not exactly clear-cut.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thinking that all he had to do was to find out more about Coldmoon, he came unbriefed on Opula’s view of the match; so even this slippery lad now finds himself in a bit of a jam.“The word ‘suppose’ implies some measure of uncertainty.” My master, tactless as ever and not a man to be put off, goes in again like a bull at a gate.“True enough.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps I should have expressed myself more clearly.Now, the daughter certainly has a certain inclination.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Oh yes, Mrs. Goldfield told me so herself, though I gather she sometimes says some awful things about Coldmoon.”“Who does?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
D’you mean the daughter?”“Yes.”“What impudence!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That snip of a girl disparaging Coldmoon!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, it can hardly mean that she cares for him.”“But that’s just it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Odd you may think it, but sometimes people do run down precisely those they love.”“I can’t conceive that anyone could be so deranged as to behave like that.” Such intricate convolutions of human nature are quite beyond my master’s blunt and simple mind.“In fact the world is full of such people.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Certainly that’s how Mrs.Goldfield interprets her daughter’s comments.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She said to me ‘My daughter must be quite taken with that young Coldmoon, for I’ve even heard her say he looks like a bewildered gourd.’”These revelations of the strangeness of the human heart leave my master dumbstruck.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Wide-eyed and wordless, he stares in astonishment at Suzuki as though he were some soothsayer wandered in from the street.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Surely then, you can see that if the Goldfields are so worried that they ask me to come round here and talk to you, that very fact indicates the strength and nature of their daughter’s yearnings?” One can’t deny Suzuki’s clever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is relieved to notice that my master seems impressed by his latest line of argument, but realizing that the question of the degree of bleeding in Miss Goldfield’s heart is likely to be re-opened if he allows the conversation to loiter on her feelings about Coldmoon, he concludes that the best way to complete his mission is to drive the discussion forward as quickly as possible.“So, you see, as I’ve just explained, the Goldfields aren’t expecting money or property; what they’d like instead is that Coldmoon should have some status of his own, and by status they mean the public recognition of qualification that is symbolized in a senior degree.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s not that they’re so stuck-up as to say that they’ll only consider giving him their daughter if he holds a doctorate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You mustn’t misunderstand them.Things got jumbled up the other day when Mrs. Goldfield called on you purely because Waverhouse chose to amuse himself with his usual display of verbal fireworks and distorting mirrors.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No, no, please don’t protest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I know it was none of your fault.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Mrs. Goldfield spoke in admiration of you as a frank and honest man.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m certain that the blame and any awkwardness that may have arisen must be laid at Waverhouse’s door.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, you see, the nub of the matter is this: if Coldmoon can get a doctorate, he would have independent status.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"People would naturally look up to Dr. Coldmoon, and the Goldfields would be proud of such a son-in-law.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So what are the chances of Coldmoon’s making an early submission of his thesis and receiving his doctorate?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You see, so far as the Goldfields themselves are concerned, they’d be the last to demand a doctor’s degree, they wouldn’t even ask for a bachelor’s.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But they have to consider what the world and his wife will say, and when dealing with the world one simply cannot be too careful.”So presented, the Goldfields’ request for a doctorate seems not altogether unreasonable, and anything he deems not altogether unreasonable qualifies for my master’s support.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He feels inclined to act as Suzuki suggests.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Suzuki, it is clear, can twiddle my master around his artful little finger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I recognize my master as indeed a simple, honest man.“Well, in that case, next time Coldmoon drops around, I’ll urge him to get on with his thesis.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, I feel that I must first question him closely to ascertain whether or not he really wants to marry that Goldfield girl.”“Question him closely!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you act with such meticulous formality, the business will never get settled.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The quickest way to a happy ending is to sound his mind, casually, in the course of an ordinary conversation.”“To sound his mind?”“Yes, but perhaps the word ‘sound’ is not quite right since it can be thought to smack of indirection.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Of course I’m not suggesting deception of any kind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What I mean is that you would understand the drift of his mind in this matter from simply talking with him about generalities.”“You might understand, but I wouldn’t unless I ask him point-blank.”“Ah well, I suppose that’s up to you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I don’t think it would be reasonable to ruin a romance by slinging cold water on it, quite unnecessarily and even for fun, like Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps one doesn’t need actually to jostle them into marriage, but surely in matters of this sort, the two parties most directly concerned should be left undistracted by irrelevant outside influences to settle their future for themselves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So next time Coldmoon calls, try, please, not to interfere.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Of course I don’t mean you yourself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m referring to Waverhouse; nobody emerges scatheless whom Waverhouse discusses.” Since Suzuki could not very well speak ill of my master, he spoke thus bitterly against Waverhouse, when, talk of the devil, who should come floating unexpectedly in on a spring breeze through the kitchen but Waverhouse himself.“Hello,” he said, throwing the accent onto the second syllable, “a visitor from the past!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I haven’t seen you in years.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You know,” he rattled on,“Sneaze treats intimate friends like me with scant ceremony.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Shocking behavior!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One ought to visit him roughly once a decade.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Those sweets, for instance, you wouldn’t get those if you called here often.” Scanting all ceremony,Waverhouse reaches over and crams his mouth with a large piece of red-bean sugar-paste confection from the well-known Fujimura shop.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Suzuki fidgets.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master grins.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Waverhouse munches.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As from the veranda I watched this interlude, I realized that good theater need not depend upon speech, that high dramatic effect can be achieved with mime.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The Zen sect practices instantaneous mental communication of truth from mind to mind in dialogues of silence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The dumb show going on within the room is, no doubt, a version of that practice; and the dialogue, though brief is pretty sharply worded.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was, of course, Waverhouse who broke the silence.“I’d thought, Suzuki, that you’d become a bird of permanent passage, always coming or going somewhere, but I see you’ve landed back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The longer one lives, the greater the chance that something odd will turn up.” Waverhouse babbles away to Suzuki with that same complete absence of reserve which characterizes his conversations with my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though they lodged together in their student days, still it would be normal for a man to address someone whom he hasn’t seen for at least ten years with a little more formality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Except when that man is Waverhouse.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That he pays not the least regard to the requirements of convention marks him out as either a superior soul or a rightdown job-bernowl.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But which one cannot say.“That’s a little hard.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Aren’t you being a trifle pessimistic,” commented Suzuki noncommittally, but his way of fingering his watch-chain betrayed a continuing unease.“Tell me, have you ever ridden on a tram?” My master shot this sudden and peculiar enquiry at Suzuki.“It seems that I’ve come here today simply to provide you two city-wits with a laughingstock on which to hone your singular sense of humor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though it’s true that I’m very much up from the provinces, I actually happen to own some sixty shares in the Tram Company of your precious city.”“Well, that’s not to be sneezed at!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I myself once used to own eight hundred and eighty-eight and a half of them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I’m sorry to say that the vast majority have now been eaten by insects, so that I’ve nothing but one single half-share left.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you’d come up to Tokyo a little bit earlier, I would gladly have given you some ten shares that, until very recently, the moths had not yet got at.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a sad misfortune.”“I see you haven’t changed your personal style of ridicule.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But joking apart, you’re bound to do well if you just hang on to stocks of that quality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They cannot fail, year after year, to climb in value.”“Quite right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even half a share, provided one holds it for roughly a thousand years, will end up making you so rich you’ll need three stron-grooms.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You and I, razor-minded fellows with our senses keyed to the economic inwardness of these stirring times, are, of course, keenly conscious of the significance of stocks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But what about poor Sneaze?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just look at him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To him,” said Waverhouse, conferring on my master a look of withering pity, “stocks are no more than some vague kind of gillyflower.” He helped himself to another piece of confectionery.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His appetite is contagious, for my master, too, stretches out his arm toward the sweet dish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is in the immutable nature of the human world that positivity should triumph, that initiative be aped.“I do not care two hoots about stocks or shares, but I do wish poor old Sorosaki had lived to ride, if only once, on a tram.” With morose concentration my master studies the pattern cut by his teeth in his half-eaten sweet.“Had Sorosaki ever got into a tram, sure as egg is egg, he’d have finished up at the end of the line in Shinagawa.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He was an absent-minded man.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s better off where he is now, engraved upon a weight-stone as Mr. the-late-and-sainted Natural Man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
At least he knows where he is.”“I’d heard that Sorosaki had died.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m sorry.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He was a brainy chap,” says Suzuki.“Brainy, all right,”Waverhouse chipped in, “but when it came to cooking rice he was a positive imbecile.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every time it came round to Sorosaki’s turn to do the cooking, I contrived to keep body and soul together by eating out on noodles.”“True, Sorosaki’s rice had the peculiar characteristics of smelling burnt yet being undercooked.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I, too, used to suffer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s more, he had an odd way with the accompanying bean-curds.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Uncooked and so cold that one could not eat them.” Suzuki dredges up a grievance ten years old.“Even in those days Sneaze was Sorosaki’s closest friend.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They used to trot off together every evening to gulp down rice-cakes swamped in red-bean soup, and, as a proper and inevitable result, Sneaze is now a martyr to dyspepsia.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As a matter of fact, since it was Sneaze who always guzzled most, he should by rights have predeceased his crony.”“What extraordinary chains of logic do run around in your contraption of a mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway,” remarked my master, “there was nothing particularly reprehensible about my going out for sweet-bean soup.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I remember it, your own evening expeditions took the form of haunting a graveyard in order to beat up tombstones with a bamboo stick.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You called it physical exercise, but that didn’t save you from a right old rap on the knuckles when the priest came out and caught you.” In this exchange of student reminiscence I thought my master’s counter-swipe with the tombstones far more telling than that dribble of soup from Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, by his laughter,Waverhouse himself acknowledged the defeat.“Indeed,” he said, “I well remember that priest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He told me I was thumping on the noddles of the dear departed, which would disturb their sleep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, would I please desist.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All I did was to make some practice passes with a bamboo wand, but General Suzuki here, training his body with wrestlers’ drills, engaged those stones in violent personal combat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I recall that on one occasion he wrestled loose and overthrew three monuments of assorted sizes.”“That did annoy the priest.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He got quite fierce about it, insisting I restore my victims to their original positions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I asked him to hold his horses for a moment while I went and hired some navvies for the job, but he wouldn’t hear of it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘Navvies,’ he said, ‘won’t do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only your own hands can purge the evil they have done.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The dead will accept no penitence but yours.’”“And what a sight you were!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Moaning and groaning through those muddy puddles in a calico shirt and a loincloth tied with string.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“And I remember you, with a coldly serious face you stood and sketched me as I struggled with those goddam stones.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such utter heartlessness.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m very slow to anger, but at that time, from the bottom of my heart, I ached to kill you for your insultingly dispassionate detachment.I can still remember what you said that day.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Can you, I wonder?”“How could anyone remember what was said ten years ago.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I do, however, recall the words engraved on one of the stones: Returning Fountain Hall, Lord Yellow Crane the Great Deceased, January 1776.The stone, moreover, was antique and elegant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was tempted to make off with it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Its general style was Gothic and chimed entrancingly with those aesthetic principles I cherish.” Waverhouse is off again, flaunting his gimcrack knowledge of aesthetics.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Whoever heard of Japanese Gothic from 1776. .,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".“That’s as may be, but listen to what you said.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
These are your very words.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘Since I propose to devote my days to the study of aesthetics, I must, for future reference, grasp each and every opportunity to set down upon paper any event of interest in this universe which comes before my eyes.’What’s more, you were kind enough to dispassionately add ‘A man such as I, one totally and exclusively committed to the pursuit of learning, cannot permit himself the luxury of such personal feelings as those of pity or compassion.’ I could have done you in for such nonchalance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But all I did, in fact, was to grab your sketchbook with my muddied hands and rip the thing to ribbons.”“And it was from precisely that moment that my talent as a creative artist, up until then widely accepted as remarkably promising, was nipped in the bud, never to bloom again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I have my own whole skeleton of bones still to pick with you.”“Don’t be so daft.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If anyone’s entitled to a grudge, it’s me.”“Waverhouse, from as far back as my mind can reach, has always been a windbag.” My master, having munched his sweet to extinction, rejoins the conversation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“He never means what he says and has never been known to keep a promise.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Pressed hard for an explanation, he never apologizes but trots out endless pretexts and prevarications.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Once when the myrtles were in bloom in the temple yard, he told me that he would complete a treatise he was writing, on those same old cherished principles of aesthetics, before the flowers fell.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘Impossible,’ I said.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can you guess his answer?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He claimed, despite appearances, to be of iron will.‘If you doubt my word,’ he said, ‘just name your bet.’ I took him up on it and we agreed that the loser should stand a dinner at a Western restaurant over in Kanda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I took the bet because I was certain that he’d never get his writing done in time, but I confess that, not in fact having the cash to pay for the dinner if I lost, I remained a little nervous that he still might work a miracle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, he showed no signs of getting down to work.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A week went by, three weeks went by, and still he hadn’t written a single page.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At last the flowers of the myrtle fell, and, though the tree stood empty, Waverhouse stood calm.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Looking forward to my Western meal, I pressed our friend to meet his obligation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not to put too fine a point upon his answer, he told me to get lost.”“No doubt,” chimed in Suzuki, “he offered this, that and the other reason?”“Indeed he did, the barefaced rogue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You can’t imagine how obstinate he was.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘Say what you will,’ he said, ‘about my other flaws and faults.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I admit them all, and readily.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the fact remains that in strength of will I’m stronger than the pack of you.’”“Do you mean,” asked Waverhouse himself, “that, having written nothing, I still claimed not to have lost the bet?”“Of course you did.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You said the bet was not about finishing the treatise but about your iron will.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And in respect of that iron quality, so you most willfully informed me, you would yield to none.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You conceded that your memory might be poor; so poor indeed that you had next day forgotten that you intended to write a paper on the principles of aesthetics; but you maintained that your will to write it remained ferric to the core.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The fault lay in your memory, not in your will.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, though the myrtle flowers were fallen and the treatise still unwritten, you made it painfully clear that you saw no reason why you should come across with my dinner.”“Now that’s very interesting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And so very typical of Waverhouse.” I can’t see what in that rather tedious story should so particularly interest Suzuki, but the tone of his comments is markedly different from that which he used before Waverhouse came in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps such variousness is a sign of a clever man.“Not in the least interesting.” My master interjects a sharpish contradiction.“It distresses me that you should still be feeling so put out about it, but is it not for that very reason that I’ve had men out with lanterns searching high and low for those peacocks’ tongues I promised you?Don’t be so huffy, Sneaze.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just wait a while and all shall be made up.Incidentally, this talk about writing a treatise reminds me that I’ve called today with some especially odd news.”“Since you bring round odd news every time you visit, I’ll take that statement with a pinch of salt.”“But today’s odd news truly is sensational.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Cross my heart and hope to die, it’s stunning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Coldmoon’s started writing his thesis.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What about that?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since in his own quaint way Coldmoon has a fairly elevated opinion of himself, I wouldn’t have expected him to engage in such a mundane, tasteless chore as getting a thesis actually written, but it appears that he, too, is tainted with wordly ambition.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now don’t you think that odd?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’d better let that Goldfield woman know that she may now start dreaming of decking her family tree with a full-blown doctor of acorns.”At the first mention of Coldmoon’s name, Suzuki begins jerking his chin and twitching his eyes at my master in silent pleas that nothing should be said of their recent conversation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master fails to notice these entreating galvanisms.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A short while back, under the suasion of Suzuki’s moral lecture, he had felt sufficiently sorry for the love-lorn daughter not to indulge his unabated antipathy toward her mother.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But as soon as Waverhouse referred to Madam Conk, his recollection of his recent row with that virago came flooding back in full spate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That the row had had its comic aspects did not make it any the less provoking.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the news that Coldmoon had started to write his thesis, that was really marvelous.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He was grateful to Waverhouse, who had more than fulfilled his boast of having something startling to say, for bringing such a welcome present.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was, indeed, a stunning piece of news; stunning but singularly pleasant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It doesn’t greatly matter, one way or the other, whether Coldmoon marries the girl, but it is certainly an excellent thing for the lad to get his doctorate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In surprising ways my master knows himself, and would with absolute humility accept that not a tear need fall if a botched wooden statue is left undecorated to rot away in some dark back-corner of a sculptor’s shop.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when a statue is superbly carved, when its basic quality is noble, then no effort should be spared and no time wasted in ensuring that it be given gilding of appropriate splendor.“Are you really telling me that Coldmoon’s started writing?” my master enquires eagerly and paying no attention at all to the jittering Suzuki.“What a suspicious mind you’ve got!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t you ever believe what I tell you?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yes, he’s started, but I regret I cannot tell you whether his thesis will be concerned with the stability of acorns or with the mechanics of hanging.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whatever the subject, a Coldmoon thesis must be a glorious snub for the Nose.”Suzuki has been getting more and more restive as Waverhouse repeats and develops his discourteous references to Madam Conk;Waverhouse, not noticing, sails unconcernedly on.“I have,” he said, “carried out some further research into noses and am happy to advise you of an interesting treatment of the subject in the Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Had Sterne but known of that mountain of relevant material, how greatly it would have helped him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The sadness of chronology!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To think that that staggering organ, eminently qualified as it is to gain immortal nose-fame, should be born, like many another nosegay, to blush unseen!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One’s heart is filled with an immense compassion.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When next it thrusts itself upon us, I shall sketch that vast promontory of flesh for my future reference in the study of aesthetics.” There’s no restraining Waverhouse.“But I hear that the Goldfield girl is yearning to be Coldmoon’s bride.” My master makes a fair summary of Suzuki’s representations, while the latter, annoyance twitching from every feature on his face and electric messages flashing from his eyes, signals desperately for disengagement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, like some nonconducting substance, remains immune to these distraught discharges.“How bizarre.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It strains the mind to think that the daughter of such a man might fall in love.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not, I would imagine, that it could be love of any quality, just rubbing noses.”“Whatever its nature,” my master commented, “let’s hope that Coldmoon marries her.”“What’s that?” said Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Who’s now hoping Coldmoon marries her?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only the other day you were dead against such a disastrous match.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Have you gone soft or something?”“It’s not a matter of going soft.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I never go soft, but.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“But something’s happened?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That’s it, isn’t it?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now look here, Suzuki, since you’re some kind of lower life-form in the business jungle, let me give a piece of advice to guide your future slitherings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s with reference to that grunting Goldfield and his piglet daughter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The idea that reasonable persons might be called upon to treat that creature with the respect due to the wife of Mr. Avalon Coldmoon, that talented national figure, why, man, the thing’s impossible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They’d no more balance each other than would a paper-lantern and a big bronze bell.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No one who calls himself a friend to Coldmoon could stand by and not speak against the folly of such a misalliance.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Surely, Suzuki, even you, looking at it as a businessman, can see the sense in what I’m saying.”“What a kerfuffle you do still manage to kick up!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Always something stirring, eh?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You haven’t changed one little bit in all of these ten years.Really, it’s remarkable.” Suzuki tries to slither round the question.“Since you compliment me as being remarkable, let me display some more remarkable dollops of learning appropriate to this case.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The ancient Greeks set very high store by physical prowess and encouraged its pursuit by awarding valuable prizes to the winners of all sorts of athletic contests.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, strangely enough, there is no record that they ever offered prizes for intellectual prowess.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Until recently this curious circumstance incessantly puzzled me.”“I see,” says Suzuki still trying to make himself agreeable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“That does seem odd.”“However, just the other day, I chanced, in the course of my researches into aesthetics, to light upon the explanation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Years of accumulated worrying fell instantly away from me and, in that blessed trice, as though disburdened of all errors and earthly delusions, I found myself transported to that pure realm of infinite enlightenment where my soul rejoiced in its transcendence of the world and its attainment of pansophic self-awareness.”Waverhouse departs on such a flight of gongoristic drivel that even the toadying Suzuki allows his face to slip into the lineaments of having had enough.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“He’s at it again” may be read in my master’s resigned expression as, with eyes cast down, he sits there tapping, kan-kan-kan, on the rim of the cake-dish with his ivory chopsticks.Nowise disconcerted,Waverhouse blathers on.“And to whom do you think we are indebted for that brilliant logical analysis, which, by its simple explanation of this seeming anomaly, has rescued us forever from the dark abyss of doubt?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was that famous Greek philosopher, the greatest of all scholars since scholarship began, the renowned founder of the Peripatetic School, Aristotle himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His explanation—I say, Sneaze, please stop flogging that cake-dish and pay a little more attention—may be summarized thus.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The prizes awarded at Greek contests were worth more than the performances that earned them, for the prizes were intended not only to stimulate effort but to reward achievement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, if one were to give a prize for intellectual prowess, for knowledge itself, one would have to find something to award which was more valuable than knowledge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But knowledge already is the rarest gem in the world.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The Greeks, unwilling to debase the value of knowledge, piled up chests all crammed with gold to the height of Mount Olympus.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They gathered in the wealth of Croesus, and wealth beyond that wealth, but in the end they recognized that the value of knowledge cannot be matched, let alone exceeded.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, masters of reason that they were, they decided that the prize should be nothing at all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From this, Suzuki, I trust you will have learnt that, whatever the color of your money, it is worthless stuff compared with learning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Let us accordingly apply this revealed truth, this fundamental principle, to the particular problem that has arisen today.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Surely you’re bound to see that Goldfield’s merely a paper man, a bill of exchange with eyes and a nose scrawled onto it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I may put it epigrammatically, the man’s no more than an animated banknote.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And if he’s money in motion, currency one might say, his daughter’s nothing but a circulating promissory note.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In contrast, now, let us consider Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
With consummate ease he graduated with the best degree of his year from the highest seat of learning in our land.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On leaving the Imperial University, he showed no sign of slackening of effort.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the contrary, fiddling with the antique fastening-strings of his short surcoat, he devotes himself both day and night to intensive study of the thorny problem of the stability of acorns.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And in addition to all that, this indefatigable servant of learning is just about to publish a thesis which, unquestionably, will embody intellectual concepts beside whose depth, originality, and scope those adumbrated by the great Lord Kelvin must pale into insignificance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is true he was concerned in an abortive attempt at suicide, but that was no more than a passing fancy of a kind common among lads of spirit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Certainly the incident can cast no serious doubt upon his reputation as a vast repository of learning and intelligence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I may adapt to Coldmoon’s case one of my own earlier turns of phrase, I should describe him as a circulating library.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is a high-explosive shell, perhaps only a twenty-eight centimeter, but compactly charged with knowledge.And when at the properly chosen time this projectile makes its impact upon the world of learning, then, if it detonates, detonate it will.”Waverhouse, unbelievably, seems to have run out of steam.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Confused by his own jumble of metaphors, he almost flinches, and his flow of language peters pointlessly out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As the saying goes, the dragon’s head of his opening remarks has dwindled down to a snake’s tail of an ending.However, though Waverhouse may falter, he’s unlikely to shut up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In a matter of seconds he’s off again.“In that inevitable explosion things like promissory notes, though there be thousands of them, will all be blasted into dust.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It follows that, for Coldmoon, such a female simply will not do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I cannot consent to so ill-suited an alliance.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would be as though an elephant, that wisest and most noble of all animals, were to marry the greediest piglet of a greedy farrow.” With a final burst of speed Waverhouse breasts the tape.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“That’s so, isn’t it, Sneaze?” My master, silent, resumed his melancholy tapping on the cake-dish.Looking a bit depressed and obviously at his wit’s end for a suitable answer, Suzuki mumbles something about not being able to entirely agree.His position is, indeed, delicate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His hands, as it were, are still wet with blood from his verbal assassination, barely a half-hour back, of Waverhouse’s character, and a man as outrageously tactless as my master might, at any moment, come straight out with anything.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Suzuki’s soundest tactic is to receive, and if possible smother, the Waverhouse attack, and then, in the general confusion, to wriggle away to safety as quickly as he can.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Suzuki’s clever.Very much a man cast in the modern mold, he seeks to avoid head-on collisions and considers it positively medieval to enter into arguments that, of their nature, can have no practical result.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In his opinion the purpose of life is not to talk, but to act.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If events develop as one wishes, then life, its purpose thus fulfilled, is good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if events not only develop as one wishes but do so without difficulties, fret, or altercation, then life, its purpose slitheringly fulfilled, is paradisal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Suzuki’s unwavering devotion to this Elysian principle of slithering had brought him great success in the business world he’d entered after graduating from the university.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It had brought him a watch of eighteen-carat gold.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It had brought him a request from the Goldfields that he should do them a small favor.It had even enabled him to maneuver Sneaze nine-tenths of the way toward doing what the Goldfields wished.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then Waverhouse descends upon the scene.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Out of the ordinary, careless of all conventions, totally eccentric, he manifests himself as an incarnation of capriciousness operating in accordance with a psychological pattern never previously observed in the human creature.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No wonder that Suzuki feels a bit bewildered.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though Suzuki’s principle was invented by a variety of clever gentlemen seeking success in Meiji circumstances, its prime practitioner is Suzuki Tōjūrō himself, and it is consequently he who is most signally stumped when the principle proves inapplicable.“It’s only because you’re out of your depth,”Waverhouse pressed on,“that you sit there looking supercilious and offer no more useful contribution than the cool comment that you can’t entirely agree.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if you’d been here the other day when that Nose came throwing her weight around, even you, businessman to the backbone though you are, even you would have felt like throwing up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s true, Sneaze, isn’t it?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Go on, tell him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I thought you handled the situation magnificently.”“But I’m told,” my master almost smirked, “that my conduct on that occasion created a more favorable impression than did yours.”The answering laugh was a mixture of pity and scorn.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“What incredible self-confidence!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I begin to understand how you manage to sail along at school unperturbed by the mockery of your colleagues and your pupils’ shouts of Savage Tea.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In matters of willpower I’m a match for anyone, but when it comes to sheer nerve, I’m just not even in your class.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I humble myself in the presence of such staggering self-confidence.”“Why on earth should I be moved by such puerile carryings-on?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Their grumbles don’t scare me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though Sainte-Beuve was perhaps the greatest of all critics, his lectures at the Sorbonne proved so unpopular that, whenever he walked in the streets, he was obliged to carry a dagger up his sleeve to defend himself against attacks from students.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Similarly, when Brunetière’s lectures attacked the novels of Zola.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Come off it, Sneaze.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’re not a professor or a university lecturer.For a mere teacher of the English Reader to start comparing himself with world-famous professors is like a minnow demanding to be treated as a whale.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you keep on saying things like that, you’re bound to be laughed at.”“That’s just your opinion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I see it, Sainte-Beuve and I, considered as scholars, are of roughly the same standard.”“What fantastic self-esteem!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if I were you, I’d give up any idea of going around with a dagger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You might cut yourself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, if university professors do go armed with dirks, it might be reasonable for a teacher of the English Reader to carry a folding penknife.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But even so, any edged tool is dangerous.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What you ought to do is to toddle along to the Nakamise arcade down in Asakusa and get yourself a toy pop-gun.You could carry it slung from your shoulder.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’d make a charming picture.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What d’you think, Suzuki?”Suzuki’s feeling better.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Relieved that the conversation has at long last veered away from the subject of the Goldfields, he feels it safe to venture a few, and preferably flattering, sentences.“As it always was, it’s been great fun to take part again in such a lively but good-natured discussion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not having seen you two for a full ten years, I feel as though I had just walked back into a spacious sunny landscape out of some dark and narrow alley.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As you’ll understand, conversations among business associates tend to be pretty tricky.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One has to watch one’s step, constantly minding one’s p’s and q’s, and ever alert for a stab in the back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The never-ending worry and strain is genuinely painful.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I myself enjoy frank and open conversation, and it’s marvelous to be talking again with one’s student-chums in the same old style of uninhibited honesty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m delighted that my visit brought me the added and unexpected pleasure of running into Waverhouse.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well,” he concluded, “I must leave you now.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve got a man to meet.”Having delivered himself of these slithery sentences, Suzuki was beginning to lever himself loose from my cushion, when Waverhouse remarked, “I’ll come along, too.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They’re waiting for me at the Entertainment Temperance Union over in Nihombashi.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Let’s run along together.”“Fine,” said Suzuki.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Part of the way we’ll be going in the same direction.” So, arm in arm, they left.IITO WRITE down every event that takes place during a period of twenty-four hours, and then to read that record would, I think, occupy at least another twenty-four hours.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though I am all in favor of realistically descriptive literature, I must confess that to make a literal record of all that happened in a day and a night would be a tour de force quite beyond the capacities of a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Therefore, however much my master’s paradoxical words and eccentric acts may merit being sketched from life at length and in exhaustive detail, I regret that I have neither the talent nor the energy to set them all down for my readers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Regrettable as it is, it simply can’t be helped.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even a cat needs rest.After Suzuki and Waverhouse had taken their departure, it became as quiet as a night when winter’s icy wind suddenly drops and the snow falls soundlessly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, as usual, shuts himself up in his study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In their six-mat sleeping-room, side-by-side in a bumpy row, the children lie asleep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mrs. Sneaze in the adjoining room, a room that faces south, lies in bed giving suck to Menko, her one-year-old baby daughter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It has been a hazy day of the type we often get in springtime, and dusk has fallen early.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The sound of wooden clogs passing in front of the house can be heard quite distinctly in the living room and the sound of a Chinese flute, played in random snatches by someone in the boarding-house on the next street, falls lullingly in broken drifts upon my sleepy ears.Outside it must still be hazy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having filled my stomach with that dinner of rice with fish gravy which O-san had provided in my abalone-shell, I feel that a little shut-eye is precisely what I need.It has come to my ears that haiku poets have taken to using the phrase “cat’s love” as a means of indicating that a poem is concerned with the season of spring.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I have myself observed that there are nights in early spring when my fellow cats in this neighborhood set up such a cat-erwauling that sleep is well-nigh impossible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As it happens, I personally have not yet experienced such a derangement of my senses.Nevertheless, love is a universal stimulant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is the way of all things, from Olympian Zeus right down to the very humblest of the earth-worms and mole-crickets that chirrup on this earth, to wear themselves out in this exhausting field of endeavor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, therefore, only natural that cats, too, dreamily joyful, should indulge themselves in the risk-fraught search for love.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, on looking back, I remember that I myself once pined away for love of Tortoiseshell.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I hear that even Opula, that gormandizer of rice-cakes dusted with bean-flour, that daughterly extension of the very baseline of the triangled technique, old man Goldfield, I hear that even she is smitten with love for the unlikely person of Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I, consequently, would not dream of sneering at those tomcats and their lady consorts who, throughout the whole wide world, are so inspired by the ineffable magic of these evenings of the spring that they run amuck under the excruciations of their lusts and loneliness.However, and to my infinite regret, even when invited to participate, I just don’t have the urge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In my present condition all that I need is rest.I am so utterly sleepy that I simply couldn’t perform.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, I sidle sluggishly around the children’s bedding, set paw on that forbidden territory at the end where their own feet lie and, finding a suitable space, curl up comfortably and drop off into slumber.I happen to open my eyes and, looking round, find that my master is lying asleep inside the bedding spread beside his wife’s.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he goes to bed, it is his invariable habit to bring along some small Western book from his collection, but I’ve never seen him actually read so much as two consecutive pages.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sometimes he just brings the book, places it beside his pillow, and makes no faintest attempt to read it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though it seems peculiarly unnecessary to bring a book of which not one line will be read, such actions are quite typical of my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However much his wife laughs at him, however suasively she begs him to give up this stupid habit, still he persists.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Every evening he makes a point of going to bed with a book which he does not read.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sometimes he makes a positive beast of himself and shuffles in with three or four books tucked under his arms.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For several days until a little while ago, it was his nightly practice to tote in Webster’s whacking great dictionary.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I suppose this behavior reflects some kind of psychological ailment.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as some men of peculiarly extravagant taste can only get to sleep to the gentle simmering singing of one of Ryūbundō’s special iron kettles, so too, perhaps, my master cannot sleep without a book beside his pillow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would seem that for my master a book is not a thing to be read, but a device to bring on slumber: a typographical sleeping-pill, a paginated security-blanket.I take a peep to see what he’s brought tonight and find that he’s fallen asleep with a slim, red volume lying half-open on his chin, with its top edge almost brushing his moustache.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Judging by the fact that his left-hand thumb is sandwiched between the pages, he must tonight have made a praiseworthy improvement on his usual performance to the extent of reading at least a line or two.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Beside the bed, in its accustomed place, its cold, gray surface a dull reflection of this warm spring night, his nickel watch lies gleaming.My master’s wife, the nursling baby tumbled about a foot away from her, lies open-mouthed and snoring.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Her head has slipped down from the pillow.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In my opinion, there is nothing more unbecoming in the human type than its indecent habit of sleeping with the mouth left open.Never in a lifetime would a cat be caught in such degenerate conduct.The mouth and the nose have their separate functions: the former is provided for the making of sounds and the latter for respiratory purposes.However, in northern lands the human creature has grown slothful and opens its mouth as seldom and as little as possible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One obvious result of this muscular parsimony is that northern style of tight-lipped speech in which the words would seem to be enunciated through the nostrils.That is bad, but it’s even worse when the nose is kept closed and the mouth assumes the respiratory function.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The result is not only unsightly, but could indeed, when rat shit drops from the rafters, involve real risk to health.As for the children, they too, small-scale reproductions of the indignities of their parents, lie sprawled about on their bedding.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tonko, the elder daughter, as if to demonstrate the monstrous regiment of elder sisters, lies with her right arm stretched out full so that her fist is firmly planted against her sister’s ear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In a kind of sleeping counterattack, Sunko lies flat on her back with one leg flung across her elder’s stomach.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Both have managed to revolve through ninety degrees since, properly positioned, they drifted off to sleep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, perfectly at ease in their unnatural dispositions, they slumber deeply on.There is something peculiarly moving about the faint illumination of a night-lamp in the dark hours of the spring.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Over the unpretentious, but sadly inelegant interior-scene of our dwelling, it casts a flickering radiance so sweet and gentle that it seems to be inviting our gladdest marvelment at the beauty of this night.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Wondering what the time is, I look around the room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Dead silence reigns, broken only by the ticking of the wall clock, the snores of Mrs. Sneaze, and, despite the distance, the relentless grinding of the servant’s teeth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whenever they tell that Osan woman of her grinding ways, she swears it isn’t true.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Obstinately, flatly, she takes her oath that, never from the day since she was born, not that many babies turn up tusked, has she ever ground a tooth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She neither apologizes nor attempts to break the habit, just stubbornly insists that she doesn’t remember ever having done such a thing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since she does it in her sleep, it’s probably true that she doesn’t remember doing it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But facts, remembered or not, are all, alas, still facts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There are persons in this world who, having perpetrated villainies, remain assured of their own absolute saintliness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They really do convince themselves that they’re pure of any guilt.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such utter self-deception is, I dare say, a form of simple-mindedness, but however genuine the self-deception, if the actuality is objectionable to other people it should be put down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I lay there thinking that there’s no real difference between our grinding skivvy and those evil-doing gentlefolk who think themselves so righteous, the night wore peacefully on.Suddenly I hear a light double-tapping on the wooden shutters of the kitchen entrance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Odd.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
People would hardly come visiting at this time of the night.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It must be one of those damnable rats.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So let it bump.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I mentioned earlier, I long ago decided never to catch rats.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, once again, I heard a double-tapping.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Somehow it doesn’t sound like a rat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If it is a rat, it must be an extremely cautious one.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For the rats in my master’s house, like the students at his school, devote their entire energies, both day and night, to the practice of riotous behavior and seem to believe that they were only brought into this world to disrupt as violently as possible the dopey dreamings of that pitiable man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No rat of ours would make such modest noises.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No, it is not a rat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Far too timid.The other night we had a rat come boldly into my master’s bedroom, nip off a snippet from the tip of his already stunted nose and then depart in squeaking triumph.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It just can’t be a rat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As if to confirm my suspicions, the next sound that I hear is the scraping creak of the wooden shutter being lifted from its groove, and then I hear the sliding screen being eased sideways as quietly as possible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Beyond all doubt, it’s not a rat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It can then but be human.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even Waverhouse or Suzuki would hesitate at this late hour to lift the latch and walk in unannounced, and neither, I think would go so far as to dismantle a wooden shutter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Could it, I wonder, be one of those gentleman-burglars of whom I’ve heard so much?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If it really is a burglar, I’d like to see what he looks like.As far as I can judge, two steps with muddy feet have so far been taken across the kitchen floor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The third step must have been planted on one of the removable floorboards for there was a sharp thwacking sound loud enough to echo through the silence of the night.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel as if the fur on my back were being rubbed in the wrong direction with a boot brush.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For a while there was no further sound, not even the stealthiest footstep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mrs. Sneaze snores gently on, sucking in and blowing out through her gaping gob the beneficent air of this peaceful era.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master is probably dreaming some dream in which his thumb is trapped in a scarlet book.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After a while, there comes the sound of a match being struck in the kitchen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even a gentleman-thief cannot, as I can, see in the dark.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It must be very inconvenient for him.At this point I crouched well down and tried to work out what moves the intruder would next make.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Will he proceed hither from the kitchen by way of the living room, or will he, turning left through the hall, make his way to the study?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I hear the sound of a sliding door, and then footsteps on the veranda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s gone to the study.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Dead silence followed.It then occurred to me that it would be kind, while there was still time, to wake my master and his wife.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But how?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A few impractical notions spin around inside my skull like water-wheels, but I am not visited with any sensible ideas.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It struck me that I might possibly rouse them by tugging at the bedcovers.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Two or three times I tried, worrying away at the lower end of the material, but my efforts had no effect.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I then thought I might do better if I rubbed my wet cold nose against my master’s cheek.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I accordingly put my muzzle to his face, but all I got for my trouble was a sharp smack in the snoot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He didn’t even wake but, lifting his arm in his sleep, rapped me hard on the nose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The nose, even in cats, is a vulnerable area and I suffered agonies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, I persisted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since I could think of nothing else, I tried miaowing at them.Indeed I tried.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At least twice, but somehow my throat just failed to function and no sound emerged.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When at long last, and by enormous self-discipline I did manage to emit a single feeble mew, I was quickly shocked back into silence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For, though my master continued just to lie there like a log, suddenly I heard the interloper once more on the move.I hear the little creakings of his inexorable approach along the veranda.This, I think, is it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s nothing more I can do.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, slipping in between the sliding door and a wickerwork trunk, I get myself into a position suitable at least for this stage of the proceedings: a hidey-hole from which, in the safety of concealment, I can spy upon a criminal at work.The footsteps advance along the veranda until they are immediately outside the paper-door of my master’s bedroom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There they stop dead.I dare not even breathe.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My every nerve is at full stretch as I hunch down waiting for the thief’s next move.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I realized later that my feelings at that time were precisely those which I could expect to feel if I ever hunted rats.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was as though my very soul were about to pounce from my eyes.I am indebted to this thief that, though long ago I resolved never to turn ratter, nevertheless I have been enlightened, this once in my lifetime, as to the nature of the hunting thrill.The next moment a tiny area in the very middle of the third frame of the paper-door began to change color, to darken as though it had been struck by a raindrop.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I stare at that dampened spot, I can see behind its darkening an object of pale scarlet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Suddenly the paper gives and through it pokes the bare length of a wet red tongue.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The tongue seems just to pulse there for a second, and then it vanishes into the darkness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In its place a shining thing, something menacingly glittery, appears in the tongue-licked hole.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The eye of a thief.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Strangely enough, that gleaming eye seems to disregard all other objects in the room and to be concentrating its gaze directly upon the place where I lurk behind the wickerwork trunk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though that terrifying inspection cannot have lasted for even so much as a minute, I have never endured a stare so baleful or intense.So to be stared at burns away whole stretches of one’s life-expectancy.The scorching of that eye became intolerable, and I had just made up my mind to jump out from behind the trunk when the paper-door slid gently sideways and the thief was at last disclosed to my fascinated sight.Though at this point it would be normal, in accordance with the established customs of the storyteller’s art, to offer a description of this rare and unexpected visitor, I must beg the reader’s indulgence for a small digression of which the point and pertinence will, in due course, become clear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My digression takes the form of a statement of my humble views upon the nature of omnipotence and omniscience, both human and divine; views upon which I would invite the discerning comment of all my honored readers.From time immemorial God has been worshiped as omniscient and omnipotent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In particular, the Christian God, at least up until the twentieth century, was honored for his alleged possession of those qualities.However, that alleged omniscience and omnipotence could well be regarded by the ordinary man in the street as, in fact, their precise opposites: nescience and impotence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I believe that, not since the world was first created, has anyone preceded me in identifying this extraordinary paradox.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is consequently unavoidable that I should feel a certain pride of self-discovery, pride in this revelation that I am indeed no ordinary cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is accordingly to drive home to numbskull human beings the unwisdom of sneering at cats that I offer the following analysis of the paradox which, if I had a name, would be named after its inimitable discoverer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am informed that God created all things in this universe, from which it must follow that God created men.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, I am advised that this proposition is specifically stated as a fundamental truth in some fat book which human beings call the Bible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, mankind has been engaged for several thousands of years in the accumulation of human observations about the facts of humanity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From which mass of data one particular fact has emerged which not only causes human beings to wonder at and admire themselves, but also inclines them to acquire ever-deepening credence in the omniscience and omnipotence of God.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The particular fact in question is the fact that, although mankind now teems upon this earth, no two human creatures have identical faces.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The constituents of the human face are, of course, fixed: two eyes, two ears, a nose and a mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Further, the general dimensions of those constituent items are, more or less, the same.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, though the myriads of human faces are thus all constructed from the same basic materials, all the final products differ from each other.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The human reaction to this state of affairs is not only to rejoice in how bloody marvelous it is that each and every one of them commands an individuality of appearance, but also to admire the miraculous skill of the Creator who, using such simple and uniform materials, has yet produced such an infinite variety of result.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For surely only a power of infinite originality of imagination could have created such almost incredible diversity.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even the greatest of painters cannot produce, however strenuously he exerts himself in pursuit of variety, more than twelve or thirteen individual masterpieces.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So it is natural that mankind should marvel at God’s astonishing and sin-glehanded achievement in the production of people.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since such a pro-tean creativity cannot be matched by men as themselves creators, inevitably they regard the process as a manifestation of divinity and, in particular, of divine omnipotence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For which reasons human beings stand in endless awe of God, and, of course, considered from the human viewpoint, it is entirely understandable that they should.However, considered from the feline viewpoint, the same facts lead to the opposite conclusion: that God, if not entirely impotent, is at least of limited ability, even incompetent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Certainly of no greater creative capability than muddle-headed man.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"God is supposed to have created, of intent, as many faces as there are people.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But surely one cannot just dismiss the possibility that, in fact, he lacked sureness of touch; that, though he originally intended to create every man-jack of mankind with the same face, he found the task impossible, and that he consequently produced so long a string of botched appearances as to end up with the present disorderly state of the human physiognomy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Thus the variformity of the human face can equally well be regarded either as a demonstration of God’s success or as evidence of his failure.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Lacking knowledge of his original creative intent, one can only say that the evidence of the human face argues no more strongly for God’s omnipotence than it does for his incompetence.Consider human eyes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They are embedded in pairs within a flat surface and their owners, therefore, cannot simultaneously see to both their left and right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is regrettable, but only one side of any object can, at any one time, enter their field of vision.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being thus incapable of seeing in the round, even the daily happenings of life in his own society, it is perhaps not surprising that man should get so excited about certain one-sided aspects of his limited view of reality, and, in particular, should allow himself to fall into awe of God.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Any creature capable of seeing things whole must recognize that, if it is difficult to create infinite variation, it is equally difficult to create absolute similitude.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Had Raphael ever been asked to paint two absolutely identical portraits of the Madonna, he would have found it no less irksome than to be pressed for two pictures of that subject in which every single detail was totally different.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, it is probable that the painting of identical portraits would prove the harder task.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Kōbō Daishi was not only the Great Teacher but also a master calligrapher.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But had he been asked one morning to inscribe the two characters of his own name in exactly the same style as he had done the day before, he would have found it more difficult than to write them differently.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consider, too, the nature of language-learning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Human beings learn their various tongues purely by imitation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They reproduce, without any display of initiative or inventiveness, the noises made by the daily mouthings of their mothers, nurses, and whomsoever else they may happen to hear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To the best of their ability, they imitate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, in the course of one or two decades, the languages thus produced by imitation show distinct changes in pronunciation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which amply demonstrates the human inability to make perfect imitations.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Exact imitation is extremely difficult to achieve.Now if God had shown himself able to create human beings indistinguishable from each other, that would have been impressive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If every single one of them appeared with the self-same features, like so many mold-cast masks of a fat-faced woman, then indeed would God’s omnipotence have been tellingly demonstrated.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the actual state of affairs, a situation in which God has let loose under the sun all manner of different faces, could well be taken to prove the limited competence of his creative power.I must confess that I have now forgotten why I embarked upon this digression.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, since similar forgetfulness is common among mankind, I trust such a lapse will be found pardonable in a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The fact is that the foregoing thoughts leapt naturally to my mind the moment that the paper-door slid open and I at last clapped eyes upon the thief.Why so?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
you may ask.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why should the sudden appearance of a thief upon the threshold prompt this closely reasoned, this irrefutable critique of divine omnipotence?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I said, I have forgotten why.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if I may have a moment to recollect my train of thought, I’m sure I can find the reason.Ah yes, I have it.When I looked at the thief’s calm face, I was so struck by one peculiarity that my long-held theories about God’s incompetence as a face-creator seemed in that instant to he crumbling down to nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For the peculiarity was that the thief’s face was the spitting image of the handsome face of our much-loved Avalon Coldmoon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Naturally, I lack acquaintances among the burglaring fraternity, but, basing my judgment on their outrageous behaviors, I had formed my own private picture of a burglar’s face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the face of this particular burglar did not match my image.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I had always assumed that a burglar’s nostrils would be widely splayed to left and right, that his eyes would be as big and round as copper coins, and that his hair would be close-cropped.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But there’s a vast difference between the fancied and the fact, so vast one should always be wary of giving free rein to one’s imagination.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This thief is tall and slimly built, with a charmingly darkish complexion and straight, level eyebrows: altogether a very modish sort of burglar.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He seems, again like Coldmoon, to be about twenty-six or twenty-seven.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Indeed a God so deft as to be able to produce this startling likeness cannot possibly be regarded as incompetent.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To tell the truth, the resemblance is so close that my immediate and astonished reaction was to wonder whether, bursting in like this in the middle of the night, Coldmoon had gone mad.It was only when I noticed the absence of any sign of a budding moustache that I realized that the intruder could not possibly be Coldmoon.Coldmoon is both masculine and handsome.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He has been manufactured by God with such especial care that it is proper he should so easily besot that walking credit card, Miss Opula Goldfield.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet, to judge from his appearance, this thief’s power to attract women can be no less strong than Coldmoon’s.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If that Goldfield girl is besotted by Coldmoon’s eyes and mouth, it would be no more than a matter of courtesy that she should go into similarly ardent raptures over those of this burglar.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quite apart from the question of courtesy, it would be contrary to logic if she failed to love him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being so naturally quick-minded and intelligent, she would, of course, immediately grasp the point, and it would follow that, if she were offered the burglar as a substitute for Coldmoon, she would, body and soul, adore him and live with him in conjugal felicity till death did them part.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even if Coldmoon so succumbs to the wiles of Waverhouse that this very rare and excellent match is broken off, still, so long as the burglar remains alive and well, there is no real cause for concern.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having thus projected the possible train of future events, I felt, purely for Miss Goldfield’s sake, relieved and reassured.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That this noble burglar exists as a husband-in-reserve is, I think, likely to be important to her happiness in life.The thief is carrying something under his arm.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Peering, I discover that it’s that decrepit blanket which, a little earlier on, my master had pitched away into his study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The thief is dressed in a short coat of cotton drawn tight below his bottom with a sash of blue-gray silk.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His pallid legs are bare from the knees down.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Gently he extends one foot from the veranda and sets it softly on the bedroom matting.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At which moment my dozing master, no doubt still dreaming that his finger is being savaged by a scarlet book, turns over in his sleep and, as he slumps with a heavy thud into a new position, suddenly shouts, “It’s Coldmoon!” The burglar drops the blanket and whips back as though he’d trodden on a scorpion.Through the flimsy paper of the sliding door, I see the silhouette of two long legs a-tremble.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master grunts in his sleep, mumbles something meaningless and knocks his red book sideways.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He then begins a noisy scratching of his dark-skinned arm as though he’d caught the scurvy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He suddenly goes quiet, and lies there fast asleep with his head off the pillow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His shout of Coldmoon-recognition relates, not to reality, but to some incident of dream.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, for quite a little while the burglar stood silent on the veranda watching the room for any further liveliness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Satisfied at last that my master and his wife are safely deep in sleep, he reintrudes one cautious foot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There is, this time, no commentary on Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Almost at once the second foot appears.The glow of the night lamp, which hitherto had bathed the whole of this six-mat bedroom, is now sharply segmented by the shadow of the thief.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
An utter darkness has fallen upon the wickerwork trunk and reaches halfway up the wall behind it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I turn my head and see the shadow of the intruder’s skull drifting about the wall some two-thirds of the way up to the ceiling.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though the man is certainly handsome, the misshapen shadow of his head, like some deformed potato, is positively ludicrous.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For a while he stood there staring down at Mrs. Sneaze’s face and then, suddenly and for goodness knows what reason, broke into a grin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was surprised to find that even in such aimless grinning he was a twin to Coldmoon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Lying close to Mrs. Sneaze’s pillow there is an oblong box, perhaps fifteen inches long and some four inches broad.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The lid is nailed down fast and the box itself so placed as to suggest that its contents must be precious.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is in fact that box of yams which, just the other day, Mr. Tatara Sampei presented to the Sneazes on his return from holiday at his family’s country place in Karatsu.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, one must admit, rather unusual to go to sleep with yams to decorate one’s bedside, but Mrs. Sneaze is a lady little troubled by notions of propriety of placement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She keeps high-quality cooking sugar in her chest of drawers, so the presence in her bedroom of pickles, let alone of yams, would hardly even ruffle her placid unconcern.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the burglar, a non-participant in the alleged omniscience of God, could hardly be expected to have such knowledge of her nature and it is consequently understandable that he should jump to the conclusion that a box so carefully kept within hand’s reach of a sleeping woman is certain to be worth removing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He lifts and hefts the box.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Finding its weight matches his expectations, he nods in satisfaction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It suddenly struck me as extremely funny that this gentleman-thief this very prepossessing burglar, was about to waste his expert skills in vegetable furacity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, since it could be dangerous to make my presence heard, I hold back the laughter bursting to escape.The burglar wraps the yam box carefully in the blanket and looks round the room for something with which to tie the bundle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His eye lights upon the sash that my master threw down on the floor when he was undressing for bed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The burglar ties and knots the sash around the yam box and hoists it smoothly onto his back.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I doubt if women would be attracted to the figure he now presents.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He proceeds to stuff two of the children’s sleeveless jackets into my master’s knitted underpants.Each of the leg parts looks like a snake that has swallowed a frog.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps their swollen ugliness could be better compared to the shape of some pregnant serpent.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
At all events the shape produced was odd and rather ugly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you don’t believe me, try it for yourself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The thief then tied the pant legs round his neck, leaving his hands free for further rummage.Wondering what he’ll nobble next, I watch him closely.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He spreads out my master’s silk kimono on the floor and neatly, quickly, piles upon it Mrs. Sneaze’s obi, my master’s haori, and his remaining underwear together with various bits and bobs which he finds about the room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am deeply impressed by the sheer professionalism of his larceny, the technical polish of his packaging and parcel work.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First he fashions a long silk cord by knotting Mrs. Sneaze’s obi-string to her waistband-fastener.With this cord he ties his loot into a tidy package, and lifts the lot with one hand.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Taking a last look round, he spots a packet of cheap gaspers lying beside my master’s head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He shoves the packet into his sleeve but, on second thought, takes it out again and, carefully selecting a cigarette, bends to light it at the flame of the night lamp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He inhales deeply, like a man content with a job well done.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Before the exhaled smoke had thinned to nothingness around the milky glass of the night lamp’s chimney, the sound of the burglar’s footfalls had faded away into silent distance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Husband and wife remain deep-sunk in slumber.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Contrary even to their own idea of themselves, human beings are a careless and unwary lot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I myself feel quite worn out by the night’s excitements and, if I now continue this account of them, I shall have some kind of break-down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".I slept both deep and late, so that, when I finally awoke, the sun was already bright in the blue spring sky.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master and his wife were talking to a policeman at the kitchen entrance.“I see.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You reckon he entered here and then worked round toward the bedroom?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And you two were asleep and noticed nothing at all?”“That’s right.” My master seems a bit embarrassed.“And about what time did this burglary take place?” The policeman asks the usual silly question.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one could he in a position to state the hour of such an offense, the chances are that no offense would have occurred.My master and his wife seem not to realize this point and take the question in real earnest.“I wonder whenabouts it was.”“Well now, let me think,” says Mrs. Sneaze.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She seems to imagine that by taking thought one can fix the time of events that took place when one was unconscious.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“What was the time,” she asks her husband, “when you went to bed?”“It was after you that I went to bed.”“Yes,” she agrees, “I went to bed before you did.”“I wonder what time I woke up.”“I think it was at half past seven.”“So what time would that make it when the thief broke in?”“It must, I suppose, have been sometime in the dead of night.”“Of course it was sometime in the dead of night.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But what I’m asking you about is the particular time.”“Well, that I can’t just say for certain.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not until I’ve had a good think.” She’s still committed to her thinking ways.The policeman had only asked his potty question as a matter of form, and he is in fact totally indifferent as to the precise time at which the burglar broke in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All he wants is that my master and his wife should give some kind of an answer: any answer, never mind whether true or not, would do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the victims engage in such pointless and protracted dialogue that the policeman shows signs of irritation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Eventually he snaps at them.“Right then.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So the time of the burglary is not known.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is that correct?”“I suppose it does come down to that,” my master answers in his usual drily pedagogic manner.The policeman was not amused.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He plodded stolidly on in accordance with his own routine of police procedure.“In that case you should send in a written statement of complaint to the effect that on such and such a date in this the thirty-eighth year of the Meiji Era, you, having fastened the entrances to your dwelling, retired to bed, and that subsequently a burglar, having removed such and such a sliding wooden shutter, sneaked into such and such a room or rooms and there stole such and such items of property.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Remember, this paper is not just a statement of lost goods but constitutes a formal complaint which may later be used as an accusation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’d be advised not to address it to anyone in particular.”“Do we have to identify every single item that’s been stolen?”“Yes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Set it all out in a detailed list.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coats, for instance, set down how many have gone, and the value of each one taken.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No,” he went on in answer to my master’s next suggestion, “I don’t think it would help much if I stepped inside.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The burglary has already taken place.” With which unhelpful comment he took himself off.My master, having planted himself with his writing brush and ink-stone in the very center of the room, calls his wife to come and sit beside him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, almost in belligerence, he announces, “I shall now compose a written statement of complaint.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Tell me what’s been stolen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Item by item.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sharp, if you please.”“What cheek!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Who d’you think you are to tell me to look sharp?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you talk to me in that dictatorial manner, I shall tell you nothing.” Her toilet incomplete, she plonks herself down sulkily beside him.“Just look at yourself!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You might be some cheap tart at a post-town inn.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why aren’t you wearing an obi?”“If you don’t like how I look, buy me decent clothes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A post-town tart, indeed!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How can I dress correctly when half my stuff’s been stolen?”“He took your obi?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a despicable thing to do!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All right then, we’ll start with that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What kind of obi was it?”“What d’you mean?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What kind?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How many obi do you think I’ve got?It was my black satin with the crêpe lining.”“One obi of black satin lined with crêpe.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And what would you say it cost?”“About six yen, I think.”“Six yen!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s far too expensive.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You know we can’t afford to fling our money about on fripperies.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t spend more than one yen fifty sen on the replacement.”“And where do you think you’d find a decent obi at that price?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I always say, you’re totally heartless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You couldn’t care less how wretchedly your wife may be dressed, so long as you yourself look reasonably turned out.”“All right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We’ll drop the matter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, what’s next?”“A surcoat woven with thrown silk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was given to me as a keepsake of Aunt Kōno.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You won’t find surcoats these days of that quality.”“I didn’t ask for a lecture on the decline of textiles.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What would it cost?”“Not less than fifteen yen.”“You mean you’ve been going around in a surcoat worth not less than fifteen yen?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s real extravagance.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A standard of living miles beyond our means.”“Oh, what does it matter?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You didn’t even buy it.”“What’s the next item?”“One pair of black foot-gloves.”“Yours?”“Don’t be silly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whoever heard of a woman wearing black ones?They’re yours, of course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And the price, twenty-seven sen.”“Next?”“One box of yams.”“Did he even filch the yams?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wonder how he’ll eat them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Stewed, d’you think?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Or in some kind of soup?”“How the devil should I know?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’d better run along and ask him.”“What were they worth?”“I wouldn’t know the price of yams.”“In that case, let’s say twelve yen fifty sen.”“That’s ridiculous.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How could a box of yams, even ones grown down in Kyushu and then transported here, cost as much as that?”“You said you didn’t know what they would cost.”“I did, and I don’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But twelve yen fifty sen would be plain absurd.Far, far too much.”“How can you say in one and the same breath that you don’t know their price but that twelve yen fifty sen is absurd?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It makes no sense at all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Except to prove that you’re an Otanchin Palaeologus.”“That I’m a what?”“That you’re an Otanchin Palaeologus.”“What’s that?”One can hardly blame the lady.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though long experience has given me a certain facility in decoding my master’s thoughts as expressed in vile puns and twisted references to Japanese provincial slang and the mustier tracts of Western scholarship, this particular demonstration of his skills is both sillier and more obscure than usual.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m still not sure that I understand his full intention, but I suspect he meant no more than that he thought his wife a blockhead.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why then didn’t he just leave it at “Otanchin?” Because, despite his temerarious attack on her balding pate, he lacks the guts to risk a head-on clash, and he’s not entirely certain that she’s never heard that slang-term for a fool.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So what does he do?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He sees a similarity of sound between “Otanchin” and “Konstantin,” the name of the last Palaeologue Emperor of Byzantium.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not that the sounds are sufficiently similar to justify a pun.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not that Constantine the Eleventh has any remote connection with the price of yams.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not that such truths would sway my master.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He simply wants to call his wife a blockhead without having to cope with the consequences of doing so.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No wonder Mrs. Sneaze is foxed and no wonder she presses for an explanation.“Never mind about that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What’s next on the list?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You haven’t yet mentioned my own kimono.”“Never mind about what’s next.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just tell me what ‘Otanchin Palaeologus’ means.”“It hasn’t got any meaning.”“You’re so excessively clever that I’m sure you could explain what it means if you wanted to.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What kind of a fool do you take me for?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I bet you’ve just been calling me names by taking advantage of the fact that I can’t speak English.”“Stop talking nonsense and get on with the rest of the list.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If we aren’t quick in lodging this complaint, we’ll never get our property returned.”“It’s already too late to make an effective complaint.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’d rather you told me something more about Otanchin Palaeologus.”“You really are making a nuisance of yourself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I said before, it has no meaning whatsoever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s nothing more to be said.”“Well, if that’s how you feel, I’ve nothing more to say about the list.”“What pigheadedness!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Have it your own way.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I won’t then write out this complaint for you.”“Suit yourself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But don’t come bothering me for details of what’s missing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s you, not me, who’s lodging the complaint.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I just don’t care two hoots whether you write it or you don’t.”“Then let’s forget it,” snaps my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In his usual abrupt manner he gets up and stalks off into his study.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Mrs. Sneaze retires to the living room and dumps herself down in front of her sewing-box.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For some ten minutes, this precious pair sit glaring in silence at the paper-door between them.That was the situation when Mr. Tatara Sampei, donor of yams, came bustling gaily in through the front door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This Tatara was once the Sneazes’ houseboy, but nowadays, having received his degree in law, he works in the mining department of some big company or other.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Like, but junior to, the slippery Suzuki, he’s another budding businessman.Nevertheless, because of his former connection with the family, he still occasionally visits the humble dwelling of his erstwhile benefactor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, having once been almost one of that family, he sometimes spends whole Sundays in the house.“What wonderful weather, Mrs. Sneaze.” He sits on the floor in front of her, with his trousered knees drawn up, and speaks as ever in his own Karatsu dialect.“Why, hello, Mr. Tatara.”“Is the master out?”“No, he’s in the study.”“It’s bad for the health to study as hard as he does.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Today’s a Sunday, and Sundays don’t come every day of the week.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now do they?”“There’s no point in telling me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Go and say it to my husband.”“Yes, but.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".” He looks around the room and then half-asks his hostess, “The girls, now, they’re not in?” But the words are hardly out of his mouth when Tonko and Sunko both run in from the next room.“Mr.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tatara, have you brought the goodies?” Tonko, the elder daughter, wastes no time in reminding him of a recent promise.Tatara scratches his head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“What a memory you’ve got!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m sorry I forgot them, but really, next time, I promise to remember.”“What a shame,” says Tonko, and her younger sister immediately echoes “What a shame.” Mrs. Sneaze, in a modest revival of her natural good humor, smiles slightly.“I confess I forgot the raw fish goodies, but I did bring around some yams.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Have you two girls yet tried them?”“What’s a yam?” asks Tonko, and little Miss Echo pipes up with,“What’s a yam?”“Ah, so you’ve not yet eaten them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Ask your mother to cook you some at once.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Karatsu yams are especially delicious, quite different from those you get in Tokyo.” As Tatara tootles away on his provincial trumpet, Mrs. Sneaze remembers to thank him again for his kindness.“It really was kind of you, Mr. Tatara, to bring us yams the other day.And so many of them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such a generous thought.”“Well, have you eaten them?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I had the box I made specially so that they wouldn’t get broken.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I hope you found them undamaged and in their full length.”“I’m sure we would have.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I’m sorry to say that, only last night, the whole lot were stolen by a burglar.”“You’ve been burgled for yams?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a peculiar criminal.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d never have dreamt that the passion for yams, even Karatsu yams, could be carried so far.”Tatara is enormously impressed.“Mother,” says Tonko, “Was there a burglar here last night?”“Yes,” Mrs. Sneaze answers lightly.“A burglar?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Here?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A real, real burglar?” Sunko voices wonderment, but immediately goes on to ask, “What sort of face did he have?”Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze, stumped by this curious question, finds something suitable to say, “He had,” she says, looking over at Tatara for sympathetic understanding, “a most fear-some face.”“Do you mean,” asks the tactless Tonko, “that he looked like Mr. Tatara?”“Really,Tonko, that’s very rude of you.”“Dear, oh dear,” laughs the visitor, “is my face as fearsome as all that?”He once more scratches his head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s a bald patch, about an inch across, on the back of his head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It began to appear not much more than a month ago and, though he’s taken it round to the quack, it shows no sign of improvement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, of course,Tonko who draws attention to the patch.“Why look,” she says, “Mr.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tatara’s head is shiny just like mother’s.”“Tonko, behave yourself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I told you to be quiet.”“Was the thief’s head shiny, too?” Sunko innocently asks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In spite of themselves, the adults burst out laughing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Still, the children’s chatter so interrupts all conversation that Mrs. Sneaze decides to pack them off.“Run along now and play in the garden.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Be good girls and later on I’ll find you both some sweeties.”After the girls had gone, Mrs. Sneaze turned to Tatara and with all the gravity of a fellow-sufferer enquired, “Mr.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tatara, what has happened to your head?”“Some kind of skin-infection.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not exactly moth, but a bug of some sort which takes ages to clear up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Are you having the same trouble?”“Ugh!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
don’t talk about bugs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In my case the trouble’s the usual female problem of the hair thinning because it’s drawn so tight in the married woman’s hairstyle.”“All baldness is caused by bacteria.”“Well, mine’s not.”“Come, come, Mrs. Sneaze, you’re being obstinate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One cannot fly in the face of the Scientific facts.”“Say what you like, it’s not bacteria.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But tell me, what’s the English word for baldness?”Tatara said he wasn’t sure, but he answered her correctly.“No, no,” she said, “Not that, it’s a very much longer word.”“Why not ask your husband?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He could tell you straight off.”“I’m asking you precisely because he refuses to help.”“Well, all I know is ‘baldness.’ You say the word you want’s much longer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can you give me an idea of its sound?”“‘Otanchin Palaeologus.’ I have an idea that ‘Otanchin’ means bald and ‘Palaeologus’ head.”“Possibly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ll pop into the master’s study a little later and look it up for you in Webster’s Dictionary.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By the way, the master is eccentric, isn’t he?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Fancy staying indoors and doing nothing on such a lovely day!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No wonder his stomach-troubles never get better.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why don’t you persuade him to go and view the flowers at Ueno?”“Please, you ask him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He never listens to what a woman says.”“Is he still licking jam?”“Yes, as always.”“The other day he was complaining that you’re always telling him he overdoes it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘But she’s wrong,’ he said, ‘I really don’t eat all that much.’So I told him the obvious answer was that you and the girls are also fond of jam.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Mr.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tatara, how could you say such a thing!”“But, Mrs. Sneaze, you’ve got a jam-licker’s face.”“How can you tell a thing like that by looking at someone’s face?”“I can’t, of course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, honestly, Mrs. Sneaze, don’t you ever take any?”“Well, naturally I sometimes take a little.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And why shouldn’t I?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After all, it’s ours.”Tatara laughed right out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I thought that was the answer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But seriously,” he said, adopting a more sober tone, “that really was bad luck about the burglar.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Was it only yams that he filched?”“If it were only yams, we wouldn’t be so upset.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But he’s taken all of our everyday clothing.”“Then you really are in trouble.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Will you have to borrow money again?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If only this thing here were a dog, not just an idle cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a difference that might have made.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Honestly, you ought to keep a dog, a big sturdy dog.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Cats are practically useless.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All they do is eat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This cat, for instance, has it ever even caught a rat?”“Not a single one.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s a very lazy and impudent cat.”“Ah!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
that’s terrible.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You must get rid of it at once.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Shall I take it along with me?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Boiled, you know, they’re really quite good eating.”“Don’t tell me you eat cats!”“Yes, indeed, every now and again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They taste delicious,”“You must have a remarkably strong stomach.”I have heard that among these degraded houseboys there are some so close to outright barbarism that they do, in fact, eat cats: but not until now had I ever dreamt that our Tatara, a person with whom I’d long been on terms of quite some coziness, could be so base a creature.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Of course he’s not our houseboy any longer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Far from it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though barely out of university, he is now not only a distinguished Bachelor of Law but also a rising executive in that well-known limited company, Mutsui Products.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was, therefore, more than surprised.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The proverb says, “When you see a man, take him for a felon;” the truth of that adage has been well-demonstrated by the thieving conduct of last night’s pseudo-Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thanks now to Tatara, I have just invented another proverb: “When you see a man, take him for a felophage.” The longer one lives in this wicked world, the more one learns.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is always good to learn, but as one accumulates knowledge of the world’s wickedness, one grows ever the more cautious, ever the more prepared for the worst.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Artfulness, uncharitableness, self-defensive wariness: these are the fruits of worldly learning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The penalty of age is this rather ugly knowingness.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which would seem to explain why one never finds among the old a single decent person.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They know too much to see things straight, to feel things cleanly, to act without compromise.Thinking that there might then be some merit in departing this world while still in my prime, I was making myself small in a corner lest such a departure should be forced upon me in the company of onions stewing in Tatara’s pot, when my master, drawn from his study by the sound of Tatara’s voice, slouched back into the living room.“I hear, sir, you’ve been burgled.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What a stupid thing to have happen.”Tatara opens the conversation somewhat bluntly.“That yam-purloiner was certainly stupid.” My master has no doubt whatsoever of his own profound intelligence.“Indeed, the thief was stupid, but his victim wasn’t exactly clever.”“Perhaps those with nothing worth stealing, people like Mr. Tatara, are the cleverest of all.” Rather surprisingly Mrs. Sneaze comes out on her husband’s side.“Anyway, one thing’s clear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That this cat’s totally useless.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, one can’t imagine what it thinks it’s for.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It catches no rats.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It sits calmly by while a burglar breaks in.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It serves no purpose whatsoever.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How about letting me take it?”“Well,” says My master, “maybe I will.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What would you do with it?”“Cook it and eat it.”On hearing that ferocious proposition, my master gave vent to a minister wail of dyspeptic laughter, but he answered neither yes nor no.This, to my mingled surprise and glad relief, seemed to satisfy Tatara for he pressed no further with his disgusting proposal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After a brief pause, my master, changing the subject, remarks, “The cat doesn’t matter, but I do object most strongly to anyone stealing my clothes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I feel so cold.”He looks indeed dispirited, and no wonder he feels cold.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Until yesterday he was wearing two quilted kimonos: but today, wearing only a single lined-kimono and a short-sleeved shirt, he’s been sitting about since morning and has taken no exercise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What little blood he has is totally engaged in keeping his miserable stomach going, so naturally it doesn’t get round to his arms and legs.“It’s hopeless being a teacher.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Your world gets turned upside-down by a mere burglar.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s still not too late to make a change.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why not come into the business world?”“Since my scholarly spouse just doesn’t care for businessmen, it’s a waste of time even to suggest the idea.” Mrs. Sneaze, of course, would be delighted to see him go into business.“How many years is it,”Tatara asks, “since you took your degree?”“Eight years, I think,” answers Mrs. Sneaze looking toward her husband.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master neither confirms nor denies the period.“Eight years and your pay’s the same as on the day you started.However hard you study, no one appreciates your merits.‘All by himself the master is, and lonely.’” For Mrs. Sneaze’s benefit Tatara quotes a scrap of Chinese poetry remembered from his days in middle school.Since she fails to understand him she makes no answer.“Of course I don’t like teaching, but I dislike commerce even more.” My master seems to be a bit uncertain in his own mind what it is he does like.“He dislikes everything,” says Mrs. Sneaze.“Well, anyway I’m sure he doesn’t dislike his wife.” Tatara makes an unexpected sally.“I dislike her most of all.” My master’s comment is extremely terse.Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze turns slightly away and her face stiffens, but she then looks back at her husband and says, as if she thought she were getting a good dig in at him, “I suppose you’ll be saying next that you dislike living.”“True,” came his off-hand answer, taking the wind clean out of her sails, “I don’t like living much.” He’s way past praying for.“You should go for a brisk walk every now and again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Staying indoors all day must be ruining your health.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And what’s more, you really should become a businessman.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Making money is simple as pie.”“Look who’s talking.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You yourself aren’t exactly rolling in it.”“Ah, well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But I only joined the company last year.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even so, I’ve more saved up than you have.”“How much have you saved?” Inevitably, Mrs. Sneaze rises to such bait, and puts her question with real earnestness.“Fifty yen, already.”“And how much is your salary?” Again it’s Mrs. Sneaze who asks the question.“Thirty yen a month.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The company retains five yen and saves it up for me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In an emergency, I can draw on the accumulated capital.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, why don’t you buy some tramway shares with your pin-money?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Their value will double within three or four months.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed anyone with a bit of capital could double, even triple, his money in next to no time.”“If I had any pin-money,” Mrs. Sneaze somewhat sourly observes, “I wouldn’t now be up a gum tree all on account of some petty theft.”“That’s why I keep saying your husband should go into business.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For instance, if he’d studied law and then joined a company or a bank, he would by now be earning three or four hundred yen a month.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It seems a shame he didn’t.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By the way, sir, do you happen to know a man called Suzuki Tōjūrō who got his degree in engineering?”“Yes, he called here only yesterday.”“So you’ve seen him then.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I ran into him a few days back at a party and your name cropped up.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I said I’d once been a member of your household, and he replied that he and you had once shared lodgings at some temple in Koishikawa.‘Next time you see him,’ he said,‘please give him my kindest regards and say I’ll be looking him up one of these days.’”“I gather he’s recently been transferred back to Tokyo.”“That’s right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Until the other day he was pining away somewhere down in Kyushu, but he’s just been moved up to the head office here in Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s a smooth lad, that one.Smooth as a keg of lacquer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He even takes the trouble to speak engagingly to me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Have you any idea how much he earns?”“Not the foggiest.”“Well, on top of his basic monthly pay of 250 yen, he’ll be getting bonuses twice a year, in July and December, so that his overall income can’t be less than four or five hundred yen each month.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To think that a man like that can be coining the stuff while you, a teacher of the English Reader, can scarcely make ends meet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s a lunatic state of affairs.”“Lunatic’s the word.” Even a man as snooty and superior as my master is no different from the herd of his fellow men when it comes to matters of money.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, the very fact that he’s skint the whole year long makes him rather more keen than most to get his claws on a copper.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, having spoken at such length on the marvels of making money, Tatara has now exhausted his stock of slogans about the beatitudes of the business life: so he turns to Mrs. Sneaze on a totally different tack.“Does a man called Coldmoon come visiting your husband?”“Yes, often.”“What sort of fellow is he?”“I’m told he’s a brilliant scholar.”“Handsome, would you say?”Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sneaze permits herself an unbecoming titter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

About as good-looking as me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

”“How do you come to be interested in Coldmoon?” enquires my master.“The other day someone asked me to ask around about him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is he a man worth making enquiries about?” Even before he gets an answer, Tatara shows by his condescending tone that he doesn’t think much of Coldmoon.“As a man,” says my master,“he’s a great deal more impressive than you.”“Is he, now?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"More impressive than me?” Characteristically,Tatara neither smiles nor seems offended.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A sensitive man of the utmost self-control?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A dense unfeeling dullard?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Need one ask?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

“You always did reckon yourself the bee’s knees and the cat’s whiskers.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But what’s so foolish about being well educated?”“Someone told me that once this Coldmoon gets his doctorate, then he’ll be given someone’s daughter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Something like that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So of course I said, ‘A man’s a fool who works for a doctorate just to marry a girl.Someone should not marry someone’s daughter to anyone so foolish.Better for,’ I said, ‘someone’s daughter to marry me.’”My master wobbled his head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“To whom did you say all that?”“To the Man who asked me to ask around about Coldmoon.”“Suzuki?”“Golly, no.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wouldn’t be bandying words with a big shot like that on such a delicate matter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

It would be foolhardy to do anything else.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One wrong word and I could be out on my ear.”“Tatara,” my master suddenly breaks in, “let’s go out for a walk.”Sitting there in the scanty remnants of his wardrobe he’s grown to feel downright frozen, and the thought has just filtered through that the exercise of walking might warm him up a bit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There can be no other explanation for such an unprecedented suggestion.Tatara, that unpetrine person, that seaweed in the tide-flows of the world, that reed which bends to its lightest wind, doesn’t even hesitate.“Yes, indeed, let’s go.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"I have heard there was a Zen priest called, I fancy, Bodhidharma, who remained so long immobilized in spiritual meditation that his legs just rotted away.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That he made no move, even when ivies crept through the wall and their spreading suckers sealed his eyes and mouth, did not mean that the priest was sleeping or dead.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the contrary, his mind was very much alive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Legless in the bonds of dusty vegetation, Bodhidharma came to grasp such brilliantly stylish truths as the notion that, since Zen is of itself so vast and so illumining, there can be no appreciable distinction between saints and mediocrities.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s more, I understand that the followers of Confucius also practice forms of meditation though not perhaps to the extent of self-immurement and of training their flesh to crippledom by idleness.All such meditants have powers burning in the brain that are a lot more fierce than anything non-meditants could possibly conceive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But because the outward appearance of these spiritual giants is so solemn, calm, unutterably serene, the fathead nincompoops who come and stare at them can see nothing more than ordinary persons in states of coma, catatonia, or even simple syncope.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such mediocrities slander their betters as drones and layabouts.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the fault lies in the very ordinariness of the eyes of ordinary people, for, in truth, their eyesight is defective in that their glances merely slither over external appearances, never pierce through to spiritual inwardness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now it is understandable that a man like Tatara Sampei, that personification of all things superficial, would only see shit on a shovel if, undergoing the Zen test of a man’s ability to find purity among impurities, he were so shown a shitten shovel.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But it grieves me to the core to find that my master who, after all, has read fairly widely and ought to be able to see some little way beyond the mere surface of things, should nevertheless so readily concur in the flip-pertigibbet fancies of his shallow houseboy; at least to the extent of failing to raise objections to his casserole of cat.However, when I think things over and see them in perspective, I can understand that it’s not altogether unreasonable that my master and his houseboy should thus look down on me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Two relevant sayings by ancient Chinese sages occur to my mind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Elevated and noble music cannot penetrate the ears of the worldly wise” and “Everyone sings street-songs but very few can join in singing such learned airs as ‘Shining Spring’ and ‘White Snow.’” It’s a waste of effort to try and force those incapable of seeing more than outer forms to understand the inner brilliance of their own souls.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is like pressing a shaven priest to do his hair in a bun, like asking a tunny-fish to deliver a lecture, like urging a tram to abandon its rails, like advising my master to change his job, like telling Tatara to think no more about money.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In short, it is exorbitant to expect men to be other than they are.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now the cat is a social animal and, as such, however highly he may rate his own true worth, he must contrive to remain, at least to some extent, in harmony with society as a whole.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"That’s the way things are, and it would be very much worse, indeed fatal, if in their ignorance they went so far as to kill me, flay me, serve up my butchered flesh at Tatara’s dinner table, and sell my emptied skin to a maker of cat-banjos.Since I am a truly unusual cat, one born into this world with a mission demanding purely mental activity, I am responsible for safeguarding the inestimable worth of my own rarity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As the proverb says, “The rich man’s son is never seated at the edge of the raised hall.” I, too, am far too precious to be exposed to the danger of a tumble into calamity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

Ordinary cats catch rats.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This long but faultless chain of logic leads to but one conclusion.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have finally decided to catch a rat.I understand that, now for some time, Japan has been at war with Russia.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being a Japanese cat, I naturally side with Japan.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have even been cherishing a vague ambition to organize some kind of Cats Brigade which, if only a scratch formation, could still inflict claw-damage on the Russian horde.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being thus magnificently militant, why should I dither over a miserable rat or two?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So long as the will to catch them burns within me, why, I could rake them in with my eyes shut.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Long ago, when someone asked a well-known Zen priest of that ancient time how to attain enlightenment, the priest replied “You should proceed like a cat stalking a rat.” Indeed, such utter concentration on one’s objective is always certain to bring success.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There is, of course, that other proverb which warns against over-cleverness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The over-clever woman may well have failed to sell her cow, but I’ve never heard it suggested that an over-clever cat might fail to catch a rat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Thus a cat of my outstanding qualities should have no trouble in catching any rat around.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I cannot see how I could fail to catch one.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The fact that up until now I’ve not caught any, reflects no more than my erstwhile disinclination to do so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nothing more than that.Just as yesterday, the spring sun sets and flurries of falling cherry-blossoms, whirled on occasional gusts of the evening wind, burst in through the broken kitchen door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Floating on the water in a kitchen pail, they glimmer whitely in the dim light of a kitchen lamp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Behind the stove, on a strip of wooden boarding about two feet wide, stands the abalone-shell in which I am served my meals.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Close to the living room there is a cupboard for plates and bowls, which, being six feet long, severely reduces the already limited space.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Beside the cupboard and reaching roughly up to the level of its top, shelves extend along the wall, and on one of two lower shelves there is an earthenware mortar with a small pail placed inside it upside-down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A wooden pestle and a radish-grater hang side-by-side from hooks, and ranged beside them there’s a dreary-looking pot for extinguishing live charcoal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From the point where the blackened rafters cross, a pot-hook is suspended, and on that hook a large flat basket floats in midair.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every now and again, under the pressure of the kitchen’s drafts, the basket moves with a certain magnanimity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I was a newcomer to this house, I simply could not understand why this basket hung where it did, but, learning later that it was so placed specifically to prevent cats getting at the food which it contained, I realized once again how thoroughly mean, how preternaturally bloody-minded, are the hearts and heads of humankind.The reconnaissance completed, one must plan a campaign appropriate to the site.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But a battle with rats can only take place where rats are available to be fought.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However brilliantly one may position one’s forces, they can achieve nothing if they are alone upon the field.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was thus obviously vital to determine the rats were most likely to appear.Standing in the middle of the kitchen, I look around and wonder from what direction they would probably emerge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel as Admiral Tōgō must have done as he pondered the likeliest course of the Russian fleet.That awful O-san went off to a bathhouse a little while ago and she hasn’t yet come back.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Long ago the children went to sleep.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master ate dumplings at Imozaka, came home and has now vanished into his study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His wife, I don’t know what she’s doing but I would guess she’s dozing somewhere deep in yammy dreams.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An occasional rickshaw can be heard passing along the street in front of the house: each subsequent silence makes the night more deep, its desolation lonelier.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My decision to take action, my sense of resolute high spirit, the waiting kitchen-battlefield, the all-pervading feeling of loneliness: it is the perfect setting and atmosphere for deeds of high renown.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s no doubt about it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am the Admiral Tōgō of the cats.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyone so placed must feel, however terrifying the situation, a certain wild exhilaration, but I confess that, underneath that pleasurable excitement, I was persistently nagged by one disquieting consideration.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have decided to do battle with rats, so I care nothing for the mere number of the rats to be fought, but I do find it worryingly inconvenient not to know from which direction or directions the rats will make their appearance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have collated and analyzed the results of my recent reconnaissance, and have concluded that there are three lines of advance by which these robber riffraff might debouch upon the field.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If they are gutter rats, they’ll come sneaking up the drainpipe to the sink and thence nip round behind the stove.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In which case, my correct tactic is to be in hiding behind the charcoal extinguisher and thence interdict their line of retreat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Alternatively, such villains might slide in through the hole cut at the base of the washroom’s plaster-wall for the escape of dirty water into the outside drain: if they adopt that point of entry, they could then sneak across the washroom and so pop out into the kitchen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In which case, my best tactic is to station myself on the lid of the rice-cooker from which position, as the filthy brutes glide past below me, I could drop upon them from the sky.Finally, my visual check of the terrain has revealed, at the bottom right-hand corner of the cupboard, a gnawed halfmoon of a hole which looks suspiciously convenient for raiding rats.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Putting my nose to the place, I sniff the ground.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It smells a little ratty.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If a rat comes dashing out to battle from that curved sally-port, my best tactic is to lurk behind the pillar and pounce upon him from the side as he scuttles by.A further thought then struck me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Suppose the rats should find some line of advance along unexpectedly higher ground.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I look up and the soot-black ceiling gleams evilly in the glow of the lamp.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It looks like hell hung upside-down.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is plain that with my limited strength and skills I could neither climb up there, still less climb down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Either because if I can’t, rats can’t, or because if I can’t, rats wouldn’t, I decide that there’s no likelihood that they will descend from those infernal altitudes, and I accordingly abandon any attempt to make plans to cope with that threat.Even so, there’s danger of being simultaneously attacked from three directions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If they come from only a single direction, with one eye shut I could wipe the whole lot out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If from two directions, still I’d be able to cope.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if they come from three directions, however confident I may be of my instinctive aptitude for catching rats, the situation would be distinctly dicey.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would be an affront to my own dignity to go beg help from such as Rickshaw Blacky.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What on earth shall I do?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When, having wondered what on earth to do, one still can’t think of anything, it is, I’ve found, the shortest way to peace of mind to decide that what one fears won’t happen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In point of fact, everyone chooses to assume that the insupportable will never occur.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Look around at the world.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Today’s delighted bride holds no guarantee against death tomorrow, but the bridegroom, happily chanting auspicious texts, displays no sign of worry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The fact that he doesn’t worry is not because there’s nothing to be worried about.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The reason is that, however much he worries, it will not make the slightest difference.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, too, in my case.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve no reason whatsoever to assert that simultaneous triple-pronged attacks will certainly never be launched, but to decide that they won’t sorts best with my self-assurance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All things need assurance.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not least myself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have, consequently, reached the firm conclusion that attacks from three directions will not happen.Even so I still feel tweaks of doubt.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I pondered the cause of this continuing uneasiness and worried away at the problem until at last I understood the source of my disquiet.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is the agony of not being able to find a single clear-cut answer to a problem: in my case, to the problem of deciding which of three strategies will prove most profitable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If rats emerge from the cupboard, I have a plan to deal with the situation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If they appear from the bathroom, I have another scheme to cope with that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And if they come sneaking up through the sink, I have yet another wheeze worked out to settle their slithery hash.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But to choose one of these three courses of action and then stick firmly to my choice, that I find excruciatingly difficult.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I hear that Admiral Tōgō was similarly excruciated as he pondered whether the Russian Baltic Fleet would pass through the Straits of Tsushima, or would steer a more easterly course for the Straits of Tsugaru, or would take the longest way around by heading out into the Pacific and then swinging back through the Straits of La Pérouse between Hokkaido and Sakhalin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My own predicament enabled me fully to appreciate just how worried the noble Admiral must have been.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not only am I placed in a similar situation, but I share his agony of choice.While I was thus absorbed in contriving a solution to my problem of major strategy, the damaged paper-door was suddenly slid open, and the ugly face of O-san loomed into view.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I do not intend that turn of phrase to imply that that creature lacks arms and legs; simply that the remainder of her carcass was so indistinguishable from the background darkness that only her face, hectically bright and savagely colored, struck upon my eyes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She has just returned from the public bathhouse, and her normally red cheeks look positively scarlet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even though it is still quite early, she proceeds, probably in belated wisdom learnt from last night’s happenings, carefully to fasten up the kitchen door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
From the study comes my master’s voice enjoining her to place his walking stick at hand’s reach by his bedside.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, I fail to see why such a man should want to decorate his bedside with a walking stick.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Can it be that he’s started to fancy himself in the role of that heroic assassin who, so the classics tell us, attacked the first of the Chinese Emperors?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Can it be that he sees his walking stick as that tomb-treasure sword which, at a robber’s touch, roared like a tiger, growled like a dragon, and then flew upward into the sky?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Surely not even my perplexed master could harbor such daft delusions.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But yesterday it was the yams.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now it’s a walking stick.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What will it be tomorrow?The night is still young.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The rats are not likely to appear for some time yet.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I need repose before the coming battle.There are no windows in my master’s kitchen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Instead, just below the level of the ceiling there’s a sort of transom about one foot wide, which, left open all the year round, serves as a skylight.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was brought suddenly out of my sleep by a flurry of blossoms from the early-flowering cherries blown through that opening on a gust of wind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A hazy moonlight slants into the kitchen and casts a shadow of the stove sidelong across the wooden floor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Wondering if I have overslept, I shake my ears two or three times and then look carefully around to see if anything’s developed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Dead silence reigns, through which, as was the case last night, the clock ticks steadily on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s high time that the rats came out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wonder where they will appear.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s not long before gentle noises start-up inside the cupboard.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It sounds as though rats are trying to get at something on a plate and are scrabbling at the plate’s edge with their horny claws.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the expectation that these cupboard rats will eventually emerge from the gnawed half-moon at the bottom of its door, I hunker down to wait beside that opening.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The rats seem in no hurry to come out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Eventually the plate noise stopped, but was soon succeeded by sounds of rat feet on some sort of bowl or basin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every now and again there were heavy humpings on the other side of the cupboard door, only a bare three inches distant from the tip of my waiting nose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sometimes the sounds come even closer to the hole, but then they scamper away again and not one single rat so much as shows its face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just beyond that door the foe is rampaging through the cupboard, but all I can do is lurk here quietly at the half-moon exit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which calls for patience; very great patience.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The rats, like the Russians in the basin of Port Arthur, seem to be having a rare old shindig in their bowl.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I wish that that fool O-san had the mind to leave the cupboard door at least sufficiently ajar to allow me to slip through, but what can one expect from so thick-skulled a country bumpkin.From behind the stove my abalone-shell emits a sound of gentle rocking.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Aha!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The enemy is also coming from that direction.Very well, then.I creep forward on the stealthiest of paws but catch only a glimpse of a tail among the buckets before it whisks away below the sink.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A short while later I hear the clink of my master’s gargling glass against the metal of the wash-basin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now they are behind me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I turn to face this new danger, a whopping great rat, at least six inches long, adroitly tips a small bag of tooth-powder off the shelf above the basin, and then itself goes skittering away to safety under the floorboards.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Determined not to let him escape, I spring down after him, but even before I’d landed, the filthy beast had vanished.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Catching rats, I find, is trickier than I’d thought.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps I am congenitally inculpable of catching them.When I advance upon the bathroom, rats pop out of the cupboard.When I take post by the cupboard, rats erupt from the sink.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And when I plant myself firmly in the center of the kitchen, rats shoot racketing up on all three fronts together.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Never have I seen such impudent bravado combined with such poltroonery!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Their skittering evasion of fair fight brands them unworthy adversaries for a gentleman.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Fifteen, maybe sixteen times I darted hither and thither until, all to no purpose, I had exhausted myself both physically and mentally.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am ashamed to confess my failure, but against such mean-souled adversaries even the resourceful Admiral Tōgō would have found himself stumped.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I had launched upon this venture with high courage, a determination to subdue the foe, and even a certain elevated sense of the spiritual beauty of my undertaking, but now, tired out and downright sleepy, I find it merely fatuous and irksome.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I cease to rush around and squat down right in the center of the kitchen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, though utterly motionless, if I maintain a sharp lookout all around me, the enemy, being such miserable dastards, will never dare to try on anything serious.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When, unexpectedly, one’s enemy turns out to be so pettily paltry, the sense of war as an honorable activity cannot be sustained and one is left with nothing but a feeling of naked hatred.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When that acrid animosity dulls, one becomes downhearted and even absent-minded.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And after that general dimness fades away, one just feels sleepy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So deep is the lethargy of complete disdain that one feels prepared to let one’s foes do anything they like.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For what of any possible significance, so one asks oneself, are beings so debased capable of doing?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having myself gone through all those stages, I, too, eventually grew sleepy, and dozed off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All that lives must rest, even in the midst of enemies.I woke to find a violent wind blowing around me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Again, a gust was pitching handfuls of petals through the open transom running along below the eaves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At the very moment of my waking, something, shooting out from the cupboard like a bullet from a gun, sliced across the blowing wind and, quick as a flash, fastened its snapping teeth into my left ear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’d barely time to realize what was happening before another black shadow flickered around behind me and closed its jaws upon my tail.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This all took place within the batting of an eye.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Taking no thought whatsoever, by simple reflex action I spring to my feet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Converting all my strength into a shuddering paroxysm of my skin, I try to shake these monsters off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The demon anchored to my ear, yanked off his feet as I sprang to mine, dangles down beside my face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The end of his tail, spongily soft like a rubber tube, falls unexpectedly into my mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I take a firm grip on the beastly object and, teeth clamped fast upon it, I waggle my head from side-to-side as hard as I can go.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The tail came off in my jaws, while the jactitated body, slung first against the wall plastered with old newspapers, bounced off onto the floor-boards.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"While the rat still struggles to regain his balance, quick to seize my chance I pounce upon him, but, like some rebounding ball, he whizzes up past my descending muzzle and lands surprisingly high on one of the upper shelves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tucking in his legs, he stares down at me over the edge of his shelf.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I stare up at him from the wooden floor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The distance between us is about five feet.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Clean across that distance, the moonlight slants from the transom like a woman’s broad white sash stretched out along the air.Concentrating all my strength in my legs, I leapt up at the shelf.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My front paws grasp its edge but, weighted down by the rat still riveted to my tail, my hindlegs are left scrabbling in midair.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am in danger.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I try to clamber upward by judicious adjustment of the positions of my paws, but each such effort, by reason of the rat weight on my tail, merely results in a weakening of my pawhold.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
If my paws slip just one further quarter of an inch I shall be lost.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am really in great danger.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My claws scrape noisily along the wooden ledge.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In a last effort, I try to advance my left paw, but its claws fail to gain purchase in the smooth wood surface and I finish up hanging by a single claw of my right paw.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My body, dragged fully out under its own and the rear rat’s weight, begins both to swing and to rotate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The monster on the shelf, which has hitherto been content to sit motionless and glare at me, now hops down onto my forehead.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My last claw loses hold.Melded into one black lump, the three bodies plummet downward through the slanted moonlight.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Objects on the shelf below, the earthenware mortar, the small pail standing inside it, and an empty tin, swell the falling lump which, further swollen by the dislodgement of a charcoal extinguisher, finally splits in two.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Half the ugly mass falls straight into a water jar, while the rest disintegrates into bodies wildly rolling across the kitchen floor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the dead quiet of night the noise was truly appalling.Even my own already frantic soul was further shaken by the din.“Burglars!” Hoarsely bellowing, my master comes rushing out from the bedroom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He carries a lamp in one hand and a walking stick in the other.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
From his sleepy eyes there flashes as much of the light of battle as such a man could be expected ever to muster.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I crouch down silently beside my abalone-shell.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The two rat-monsters vanish into the cupboard.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“What’s going on here?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Who made all that hideous noise?” My master, looking vaguely sheepish, shouts in his angriest voice questions that no one’s there to answer.The westering moon sank steadily lower and lower, and its broad white sash of light across the kitchen narrowed and narrowed as it sank.IIITHIS HEAT is quite unbearable,especially for a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An English clergyman, a certain Sydney Smith, once remarked that the weather was so intolerably hot that there was nothing left for it but to take off his skin and sit about in his bones.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though to be reduced to a skeleton might be going too far, I would at least be glad to slip out of my fur of spotted, palish gray and send it to be washed or even popped temporarily into pawn.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To human eyes, the feline way of life may seem both extremely simple and extremely inexpensive, for a cat’s face looks the same all the year round and we wear the same old only suit through each of the four seasons.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But cats, I can assure you, just like anyone else, feel the heat and feel the cold.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There are times when I consider that I really wouldn’t mind, just that once, soaking myself in a bath, but if I got hot water all over my fur, it would take ages to get dry again and that is why I grin and bear the stink of my own sweat and have never in all my life yet passed through the entrance of a public bathhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every now and again I think about using a fan but, since I cannot hold one in my paws, the thought’s not worth pursuing.Compared with our simplistic style, human manners are indeed extravagant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Some things should be eaten either raw or as they are, but humans go quite unnecessarily out of their way to waste both time and energy on boiling them, grilling them, pickling them in vinegar, and smarming them over with bean-paste.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The horrible results of all these processes appear to tickle them to death.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In matters of dress they are similarly absurd.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Inasmuch as they are born imperfect, it might be asking too much if one expected them to wear, as is the custom of cats, the same clothes all year long but, surely to goodness, they cannot need to swaddle their skins in such a heterogeneity of sheer clobber.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since it seems not to shame them to be indebted to sheep, to be dependent on silkworms, and even to accept the charity of cotton shrubs, one could almost assert that their extravagance is an admission of incompetence.Even if one overlooks their oddity and allows them their perversities in matters of food and clothing, I completely fail to see why they have to exhibit this same crass idiosyncrasy in matters that have no bearing whatsoever on their continuing existence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Take, for instance, their hair.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since, willy-nilly, it grows, I would have thought it simplest and best for any creature just to leave it alone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But no.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not for humans.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Totally unnecessarily, they trick themselves out in every conceivable sort and kind of hair-do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And even take pride in their idiot variations.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Those who call themselves priests keep their heads clean-shaven blue: blue in summer, winter blue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet when it’s hot they put on sunhats, and when it’s cold they hood themselves in bits of blanket.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Given all this hatting and hooding, why do they shave their heads?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s absolutely senseless.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Again, there are some who, using a sawlike instrument called a comb, part their hair down the middle and look as pleased as punch with the result.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Others rake out an artificial separation of the hair three-sevenths of the way across their cranial bones, and some of these extend that scraped division right over the top of their skulls so that the hair flops out at the back like false banana-leaves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Some have the hair on their crowns shorn flat but cut the hair at the sides, both left and right, to hang down straight.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This creation of a square frame for a round head makes them look, if they can be said to look like anything, as though they were staring out on the world through a cedar hedge just trimmed by a maniac gardener.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In addition to these styles there are those based on cutting every hair to a standard length: the five-inch cut, the three-inch cut, and even the one-inch cut.Who knows, if such close cropping is continued, they’ll finish up with a cut inside their skulls.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Maybe the minus-one-inch cut, even a minus-three-inch cut will be the ultimate fashion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, I cannot understand why mankind becomes enslaved to such fool fads.Why, for instance, do they use two legs when they all have four available?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such waste of natural resources!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If they used four legs to get about, they’d all be a great deal nippier; nevertheless, they persist in the folly of using only two and leave the other pair just hanging from their shoulders like a couple of dried codfish that someone brought around as a present.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One can only deduce that human beings, having so very much more spare time than do cats, lighten their natural boredom by putting their minds to thinking up such nonsenses.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The odd thing is not simply that these creatures of endless leisure assure each other, whenever two of them get together, of just how busy they are, but that their faces do in fact look busy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Indeed they look so fussed that one wonders just how many men get eaten by their business.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I sometimes hear them say, when they have the good fortune to make my acquaintance, how nice and easy life could be if one lived it like a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If they really want their lives to be nice and easy, it’s already in their own good power to make them so.Nothing stands in the way.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nobody insists that they should fuss about as they do.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is entirely of their own free will that they make more engagements than they can possibly keep and then complain about being so horribly busy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Men who build themselves red-hot fires shouldn’t complain of the heat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even we cats, if we had to think up twenty different ways of scissoring our fur, would not for long remain as carefree as we are.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyone who wants to be carefree must train himself to be, like me, able to wear a fur coat in the summer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Still.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I must admit it is a little hot.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, it is too hot, a fur coat in the summer.In this appalling heat I can’t even get that afternoon nap which is my sole and special pleasure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How then shall I while the time away?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since I have long neglected my study of human society, I thought I might usefully devote a few hours to watching them toiling and moiling away in their usual freakish fashions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unfortunately, my master’s character, at least in the matter of napping, is more than a little aluroid.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He takes his afternoon siestas no less seriously than I do and, since the summer holidays began, he has not done a stroke of what humans would call work.Thus, however closely I may observe him, I should learn nothing new about the human condition.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If only someone like Waverhouse would drop in, then there’d be some chance of a twitch in my master’s depressingly dyspeptic skin, some hope of him stirring from his catlike languor.Just is I was thinking it is indeed about time that Waverhouse dropped by, I hear the sound of somebody splashing water in the bathroom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And it’s not just splashing water that I hear, for the splasher punctuates his aquatics with loud expressions of his appreciation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Perfect.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How wonderfully refreshing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One more bucketful, if you please!” The voice rings brashly through the house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s only one man in the world who would speak so loudly and who would make himself, unbidden, so very much at home in my master’s dwelling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It must, thank God, be Waverhouse.I was just thinking, “Well, at least today I shall be eased of half the long day’s tedium,” when the man himself walks straight into the living room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His shoulders recovered beneath kimono sleeves, he’s wiping sweat from his face as, without any ceremony at all, he pitches his hat down on the matting and calls out, “Hello there.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tell me, Mrs. Sneaze, how’s your husband bearing up today?” Mrs. Sneaze had been comfortably asleep in the next room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hunkered down on her knees with her gormless face bent over onto her sewing-box, she was shocked awake as Waverhouse’s yelpings pierced deep into her ears.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When, trying to lever her sleepy eyes wide open, she came into the room,Waverhouse, already seated in his fine linen kimono, was happily fanning himself.“Good afternoon,” she says and, still looking somewhat confused, almost shyly adds, “I’d no idea you were here.” As she bowed in greeting a bead of sweat glissades to gather at the tip of her nose.“I’ve only this minute arrived.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
With your servant’s kind assistance I’ve just been having a most splendid shower in the bathroom.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
As a result I now feel greatly refreshed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hot, though, isn’t it?”“Very hot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
These last few days one’s been perspiring even when sitting still.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But you look as well as ever.” Mrs. Sneaze has not yet wiped the sweat-drop from her nose.“Thank you, yes I am.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Our usual spells of heat hardly affect me at all, but this recent weather has been something special.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One can’t help feeling sluggish.”“How very true.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve never before felt need of a nap but in this weather, being so very hot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“You had a nap?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s good.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
If one could only sleep during the daytime and then still sleep at night.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"why, nothing could be more wonderful.” As always, he rattles along as the mood of the moment takes him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He seems, however, this time faintly dissatisfied with what’s popped out of his mouth, for he hurries to add, “Take me, for example.By nature I need no sleep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, when I see a man like Sneaze who is invariably sleeping whenever I call, I feet distinctly envious.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, I expect such heat is pretty rough on a dyspeptic.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On days like this even a healthy person feels too tired to balance his head on his shoulders.However, since one’s head is fixed tight, one can’t just wrench it off.”Rather unusually,Waverhouse seems uncertain what to do with his head.“Now you, Mrs. Sneaze, with all that hair on your head, don’t you find it hard even to sit up?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The weight of your chignon alone must leave you aching to lie down.”Mrs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze, thinking that Waverhouse is referring again to her nap by drawing attention to her disordered hair, giggles with embarrassment.Touching her hand to her hair, she mumbles “How unkind you are!”Waverhouse, totally unconscious of her reaction, goes off at a tangent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“D’you know,” he says, “yesterday I tried to fry an egg on the roof.”“How’s that?”“The roof tiles were so marvelously baking-hot that I thought it a pity not to make practical use of them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So I buttered a tile and broke an egg onto it.”“Gracious me!”“But the sun, you know, let me down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even though I waited for ages, the egg was barely half-done.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So I went downstairs to read the newspapers.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then a friend dropped in, and somehow I forgot about the egg.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was only this morning that I suddenly remembered and, thinking it must be done by now, went up to took at it.”“How was it?”“Far from being ready to eat, it had gone completely runny.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, it had run away, all down the side of the house.”“Oh dear.” Mrs. Sneaze frowned to show she was impressed.“But isn’t it strange that all through the hot season the weather was so cool and then it should turn so hot now.”“Yes, indeed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Right up until recently we’ve been shivering in our summer clothes and then, quite suddenly, the day before yesterday, this awful heat began.”“Crabs walk sideways but this year’s weather walks backward.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Maybe it’s trying to teach us the truth of that Chinese saying that sometimes it is reasonable to act contrary to reason.”“Come again,” says Mrs. Sneaze who’s not much up on Chinese proverbs.“It was nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The fact is that the way this weather is retrogressing is really just like Hercules’ bull.” Carried away on the tide of his crankiness, Waverhouse starts making ever more odd remarks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Inevitably, my master’s wife, marooned in ignorance, is left behind as Waverhouse drifts off beyond the horizons of her comprehension.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, having so recently burnt her fingers over that bit of unreasonable Chinese reason, she was not out looking for a further scorching.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, “Oh,” she says, and sits silent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which doesn’t, of course, suit Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He hasn’t gone to the trouble of dragging in Hercules’ bull not to be asked about it.“Mrs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze,” he says, driven to the direct question, “do you know about ‘Hercules’ bull’?”“No,” she says, “I don’t.”“Ah, well if you don’t, shall I tell you about it?”Since she can hardly ask him to shut up, “Please do,” she answers.“One day in ancient times Hercules was leading a bull along.”“This Hercules, was he some sort of cowherd?”“Oh no, not a cowherd.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Indeed he was neither a cowherd nor yet the owner of a chain of butcher-shops.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In those far days there were, in fact, no butcher-shops in Greece.”“Ah!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So it’s a Greek story?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You should’ve told me so at the start.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"”At least Mrs. Sneaze has shown that she knows that Greece is the name of a country.“But I mentioned Hercules, didn’t I?”“Is Hercules another name for Greece?”“Well, Hercules was a Greek hero.”“No wonder I didn’t know his name!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, what did he do?”“Like you, dear lady, he felt sleepy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And in fact he fell asleep.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
”“Really!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mr. Waverhouse!”“And while he slept, along came Vulcan’s son.”“Now who’s this Vulcan fellow?”“Vulcan was a blacksmith, and his son stole Hercules’ bull, but in a rather special way.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can you guess what he did?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He dragged the bull off by its tail.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, when Hercules woke up he began searching for his bull and bellowing, ‘Bull, where are you?’ But he couldn’t find it and he couldn’t track it down because, you see, the beast had been hauled off backward so there weren’t any hoofmarks pointing to where it had gone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Pretty smart, don’t you agree?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For a blacksmith’s son?” Dragged off track by his own tale, Waverhouse has already forgotten that he had been discussing the unseasonable heat.“By the way,” he rattled on, “what’s your husband doing?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Taking his usual nap?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When such noddings-off are mentioned in Chinese poetry they sound refined, even romantic, but when, as in your husband’s case, they happen day in, day out, the whole concept becomes vulgarized.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He has reduced an eternal elegance of life to a daily form of fragmentary death.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Forgive my asking you,” he brings his speech to a sudden conclusion, “but please do go and wake him up.”Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze seems to agree with the Waverhouse view of naps as a form of piecemeal perishing for, as she gets to her feet, she says, “Indeed he’s pretty far gone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Of course it’s bad for his health.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Especially right on top of his lunch.”“Talking of lunch, the fact is I’ve not had mine yet.” Waverhouse drops broad hints composedly, magnanimously, as though they were pearls of wisdom.“Oh, I am sorry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I never thought of it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s lunchtime, of course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".Well, would you perhaps like some rice, pickles, seaweed, things like that, and a little hot tea?”“No thanks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I can manage without them.”“Well, as we hadn’t realized you would be honoring us today, we’ve nothing special we can offer you.” Not unnaturally, Mrs. Sneaze responds with an edge of sarcasm, which is all quite wasted on Waverhouse.“No and indeed no,” he imperturbably replies, “neither with hot tea nor with heated water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On my way here, I ordered a lunch to be sent to your house and that’s what I’m going to eat.” In his most matter-of-fact manner Waverhouse states his quite outrageous actions.Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze said, “Oh!” But in that one gasped sound three separate “oh’s” were mingled: her “oh” of blank surprise, her “oh” of piqued annoyance, and her “oh” of gratified relief.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
At which moment my master comes tottering in from the study.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He had just begun to doze off into sleep when it became so unusually noisy that he was hauled back into consciousness, like something being scraped against its natural grain.“You’re a rowdy fellow,” he grumbles sourly through his yawns.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Always the same.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just when I was getting off to sleep, feeling so pleasant and relaxed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Aha!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So you’re awake!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m extremely sorry to have disturbed your heavenly repose, but missing it just once in a while may even do you good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Please come and be seated.”Waverhouse makes himself an agreeable host to my master in my master’s house.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master sits down without a word, and, taking a cigarette from a box of wooden crazy-work, begins to puff at it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, happening to notice the hat which Waverhouse had tossed away into a corner, he observes, “I see you’ve bought a hat.”“What d’you think of it?” Waverhouse fetches it and holds it proudly out for the Sneazes to inspect.“Oh, how pretty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s very closely woven.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And so soft.” Mrs. Sneaze strokes it almost greedily.“This hat, dear lady, is a handy hat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And as obedient as a man could wish.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Look.” He clenched his hand into a knobbly fist and drove it sharply into the side of his precious panama.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A fist-shaped dent remained, but before Mrs. Sneaze could finish her gasp of surprise, Waverhouse whipped his hand inside the hat, gave it a sharpish shove, and the hat popped back into shape.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He then grasped the hat by opposite sides of its brim and squashed it flat as dough beneath a rolling pin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Next he rolled it up, as one might roll a light straw mat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Finally, saying, “Didn’t I say it was handy,” be tucked it away into the breast-fold of his kimono.“How extraordinary!” Mrs. Sneaze marvels as if she were watching that master magician Kitensai Shoichi performing one of his most dazzling sleights of hand.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse himself appears to be bitten by the spirit of his own act for, producing from his left-hand sleeve the tube of hat he’d thrust into the breast of his kimono, he announces, “Not a scratch upon it.” He then bats the hat back into its original shape and, sticking his forefinger into its crown, spins it around like a conjuror’s plate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I thought the act was over, but Waverhouse proceeded neatly to flip his whirling headgear over his head and onto the floor behind him, where, as the climax of his performance, he sat down squarely on it with a heavy solid whump.“You’re sure it’s all right?” Even my master looks somewhat concerned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mrs. Sneaze, genuinely anxious, squeaks, “Please, you’d better stop.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would be terrible to spoil so fine a hat.”Only its owner wants to keep going.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“But it can’t be spoiled.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s the wonder of it.” He heaves the crumpled object out from under his bottom and jams it on his head.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It sprang back into shape.“Indeed it’s a very strong hat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Isn’t it extraordinary?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Quite amazing.”Mrs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze is more and more impressed.“Oh, there’s nothing extraordinary about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s just that kind of hat,” says Waverhouse smirking out from under its brim.A moment later Mrs. Sneaze turns to her husband.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I think you, too, had better buy a hat like that.”“But he’s already got a splendid boater.”“Just the other day the children trampled on it and it’s all squashed out of shape.” Mrs. Sneaze persists.“Oh dear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That was a pity.”“That’s why I think he should buy a hat like yours, strong and splendiferous.” She has no idea what panama hats can cost, so nothing moderates the urgency of her proddings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Really, my dear, you must get one, just like this.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
”At this point Waverhouse produces from his right sleeve a pair of scissors in a scarlet sheath.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Mrs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze,” he says, “forget the hat for a moment and take a look at these scissors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They, too, are fantastically handy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You can use them in fourteen different ways.” If it hadn’t been for those scissors my master would have succumbed to wifely pressure in the matter of the hat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He was extremely lucky that the inborn female sense of curiosity diverted his wife’s attention.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It crossed my mind that Waverhouse had acted of intent, helpfully and tactfully, but after careful consideration I’ve concluded that it was pure good luck that saved my master from painful outlay on a panama hat.No sooner has Mrs. Sneaze responded with a, “What are the fourteen ways?” than Waverhouse is off again in triumphantly full flow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I shall explain each of them, so listen carefully.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All right?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You see here a crescent-shaped opening?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One sticks one’s cigar in here to nip its lip-end before smoking.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This gadget down here by the handle can cut through wire as though it were mere noodle.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now if you put the scissors flat down upon paper, there’s a ruler for you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Here, on the back-edge of this blade, there’s a scale engraved so the scissors can be used as a measure.Over here there’s a file for one’s fingernails.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Right?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now then, if you push this blade-tip out, you can twist it around and around to drive screws.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, it serves as a hammer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And you can use this blade-tip to lever open with the greatest of case even the most carefully nailed lid.Furthermore, the end of this other blade, being ground to so fine a point, makes an excellent gimlet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
With this thing you can scrape out any mistakes in your writing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And finally, if you take the whole thing to pieces, you get a perfectly good knife.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, Mrs. Sneaze, there’s actually one more especially interesting feature.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Here in the handle there’s a tiny ball about the size of a fly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You see it?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, take a peep right into it.”“No.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’d rather not.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m sure you’re going to make fun of me again.”“I’m grieved that you should have so little confidence in me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, just this once, take me at my word and have a little look.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Oh, please, just one quick squint.” He handed her the scissors.Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze takes them very gingerly and, setting her eyeball close to the magic spot, does her best to see into it.“Well?”“Nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s all black.”“All black?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That won’t do.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Turn a little toward the paper-window and look against the light.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t tilt the scissors like that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Right, that’s it.Now you can see, can’t you?”“Oh, my!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s a photograph, isn’t it?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How can a tiny photograph be fixed in here?”“That’s what’s so remarkable.” Mrs. Sneaze and Waverhouse are now absorbed in their conversation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, silent now for some time but intrigued by the idea of the photograph, seems suddenly possessed by an urge to see it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He asks his wife to let him but she, her eye still glued to the scissors, just babbles on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“How very lovely.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What a beautiful study of the nude.” She won’t be parted from the scissors.“Come on, let me see it.”“You wait.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What lovely tresses, all the way down to her hips.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How movingly her face is lifted.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Rather a tall girl, I’d say, but indeed a beauty!”“Damn it, let me see.” My master, now distinctly marked, flares up at his wife.“There you are then.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Gawp away to your heart’s content.” As she was handing the scissors over, the servant trundles in from the kitchen with an announcement that Waverhouse’s meal has been delivered.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed she carries with her two lidded bamboo plates loaded with cold buckwheat noodles.“Aha,” says Waverhouse, “so here, Mrs. Sneaze, is the lunch I bought myself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With your permission, I propose to eat it now.” He bows respectfully.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As he seems to have spoken half in earnest and half in jest, Mrs.Sneaze is at a loss how best to answer, so she just says lightly, “Please do,” and settles back to watch.At long last my master drags his eyes away from the photograph and remarks, “In weather as hot as this, noodles are bad for one’s health.”“No danger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What one likes seldom upsets one.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact I’ve heard,” says Waverhouse, lifting one of the lids, “that a little of what you fancy does you good.” He appears satisfied by what he’s seen on the plate for he goes straight on to observe, “In my opinion noodles that have been left to stand are, like heavily bearded men, never to be relied upon.” He adds green horseradish to his dish of soy sauce and stirs away like mad.“Steady on,” says my master in genuinely anxious tones, “if you put in that much spice it’ll be too hot to eat.”“Noodles must be eaten with soy sauce and green horse-radish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I bet you don’t even like noodles.”“I do indeed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The normal kind.”“That’s the stuff for pack-horse drivers.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A man insensitive to cold buckwheat noodles spiced like this is a man to be devoutly pitied.” So saying, Waverhouse digs his cedar-wood chopsticks deep into the mass of noodles, scoops up a hefty helping and lifts it some two inches.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Did you know, Mrs. Sneaze, that there are several styles for eating noodles?Raw beginners always use too much sauce and then they munch this delicacy like so many cattle chewing the cud.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That way, the exquisite savor of the noodles is inevitably lost.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The correct procedure is to scoop them up like this.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
” Waverhouse raises his chopsticks above the bamboo plate until a foot-long curtain of noodles dangles in the air.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He looks down at the plate to check that he’s lifted his lading clear of the plate but finds a dozen or so of the tail-ends still lying coiled within it.“What very long noodles!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Look, Mrs. Sneaze, aren’t they the longest that you ever saw?” Waverhouse demands that his audience should participate, if only by interjections.“Indeed, they are lengthy!” she answers, as if impressed by his dissertation.“Now, you dip just one-third of these long strands in the sauce, then swallow them in a single gulp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You mustn’t chew them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Mastication destroys their unique flavor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The whole point of noodles is in the way they slither down one’s throat.” He thereupon raises his chopsticks to a dramatic height and the ends of the longest strands at last swing clear of the plate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, as he starts to lower his arm again, the tail-ends of the noodles slowly start submerging into the sauce dish held in his left hand.Which, in accordance with Archimedes’ Law, causes the sauce slowly to rise in the dish as its volume is displaced by noodles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, since the dish was originally eight-tenths full of sauce, the level of the liquid reached its brim before Waverhouse could get even one-quarter, let alone the connoisseur’s one-third, of the length of his wriggling noodles into the sauce.The chopsticks appear paralyzed about five inches above the dish and so remain for an awkward pause while Waverhouse considers his dilemma.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he lowers the noodles one more fraction of an inch, the sauce must overflow, but if he does not lower them, he must fail to conform with the standards he has established for the proper style of stuffing oneself with noodles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No wonder he looks moithered and half-hesitates.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, suddenly, jerking his head and neck forward and downward like a striking snake, he jabbed his mouth at the chopsticks,There was a slushy slurping sound, his throttle surged and receded once or twice and the noodles were all gone.A few tears oozed from the corners of his eyes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
To this day I am not sure whether those tear drops were a tribute to the strength of the green horseradish or evidence of the painful effort such gurgitation must involve.“What an extraordinary performance!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How on earth,” enquires my flabbergasted master, “do you contrive to gulp down such a mass of vermicelli in one consuming go?”“Amazing, isn’t he!” Mrs. Sneaze is equally lost in admiration.Waverhouse says nothing, puts down the chopsticks, and pats his chest an easing couple of times.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Well, Mrs. Sneaze,” he eventually answers, “a plate of noodles should be consumed in three and a half, at most in four, mouthfuls.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you drag out the process longer than that, the noodles will not taste their best.” He wipes his face with a handkerchief and sits back to take a well-earned breather.At this point who should walk in but Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His feet are soiled with summer dust but, for no reason I can offer, despite the broiling heat he’s wearing a winter hat.“Hello!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Here comes our handsome hero!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, since I’m still in the middle of eating, you must excuse me.” Waverhouse, totally unabashed, settles down to finishing off the noodles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This time, rather sensibly, he makes no effort to give a repeat performance as a vermicelli virtuoso, and is consequently spared the indignities of needing support from handkerchiefs and breathers between mouthfuls.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Eating normally he empties both the bamboo plates in a matter of minutes.“Coldmoon,” says my master, “how’s your thesis coming along?” And Waverhouse adds, “Since the delectable Miss Goldfield is yearning to be yours, you should in common kindness submit the finished text as fast as possible.”Coldmoon breaks as usual into his disconcertingly idiot grin.“Inasmuch as waiting is a cruelty to her, I’d like indeed to finish it quickly,” he replies, “but the nature of its subject is such that a great deal of drudging research is unavoidable.” He spoke with measured seriousness of things he couldn’t possibly himself be taking seriously.“Quite so,” says Waverhouse adopting Coldmoon’s style with contra-puntal skill.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“The subject being what it is, naturally it cannot be handled just as Coldmoon wishes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, that nasality her mother being the snorter that she is, naturally it would be prudent to trim one’s sails to the way she blows.”The only relatively sensible comment comes from my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“What did you say was the subject of your thesis?”“It is entitled ‘The Effects of Ultraviolet Rays upon Galvanic Action in the Eyeball of the Frog.’”“Remarkable.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just what one might expect from Coldmoon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I like both the rhythm and the substantial originality of that last bit, the electrifying shock in that ‘eyeball of the frog.’ How about it, Sneaze?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ought we not to inform the Goldfields of at least the title before our scholar finishes his paper?”My master, disregarding these waggeries from Waverhouse, asks Coldmoon, “Can such a subject really involve much drudgery of research?”“Oh yes, it’s a complicated question.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For one thing, the structure of the lens in the eyeball of the frog is by no means simple.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hundreds, even thousands, of experiments will have to be carried out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For a start I’m planning to construct a round glass ball.”“A glass ball?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Surely, you could find one quite easily in a glass shop?”“Oh, no, far from it,” says Coldmoon, throwing out his chest a little.“To begin with, things like circles and straight lines are pure geometrical concepts, and neither actual circles nor actual straight lines can, in this imperfect world, ever realize such idealities.”“If they can never exist, hadn’t you better abandon the attempt to create them?” butts in Waverhouse.“Well, I thought I’d begin by making a ball suitable for my experiments and, in fact, I started on it the other day.”“And have you finished it?” asks my master as if the task were an easy matter.“How could I?” says Coldmoon, but then, realizing perhaps that he’s getting close to self-contradiction, hurries on to explain.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“It’s really frightfully difficult.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After I’ve filed it for some time, I notice that the radius on one side is too long, so I grind it fractionally shorter, but this leads on to trouble, because now I find the radius on the other side excessive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When, with great effort I grind that excess off, the entire ball becomes misshapen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"At this stage in my studies I have no choice but to grind glass balls morning, noon, and night.”“I seem to recall,” says Waverhouse, now very much in his element, “a Kabuki play in which one character gains his ends by disguising himself as a gardener.” He strikes an attitude and quotes, “‘As I was luckily brought up among civilian non-officials, no one knows my face: so I enter as a cultivator of chrysanthemums.’ You, Coldmoon, seem bent on gaining your ends disguised as a cultivator of crystals.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Thinking it peculiar that, years after his graduation, he should still be using the library, I said to him, ‘Knarle-Damson,’ I said, ‘I’m most impressed, Knarle-Damson, to find you still imbibing at the fount of learning.’ He gave me a very odd look and explained that, far from wanting to consult a book, he’d been caught short as he passed the university and had just popped in for a pee.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"“It’s all very well,” he said, “to pass your days frotting away at glass but when do you expect to finish your thesis and get your doctorate?”“At my present rate of progress, maybe in ten years.” Coldmoon seems far less concerned than my master about the doctorate.“Ten years, eh?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I think you’d better bring your grinding to a halt rather sooner than that.”“Ten years is an optimistic estimate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Of course I’d be only too happy to get it quickly, and so set the young lady’s mind at rest, but until I’ve got the glass ball properly ground, I can’t even launch out on my first experiment.” Coldmoon’s voice trailed off into silence as though his mind were staring into the lens of a frog’s eyeball but, after a brief pause, he continued.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"“How very odd,” he says, “I can’t understand it.”There are occasions when Waverhouse fulfills a useful social function.When a conversation flags, when one is embarrassed, when one becomes sleepy, when one is troubled, then, as on all other occasions, Waverhouse can be relied upon to have something immediate and diverting to say.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"But it remains a fact that it was a disappointment in love that has made me, to this day, a lonely bachelor.” Waverhouse leveled a steady look upon each of his listeners, one after the other.It was Mrs. Sneaze who laughed, though she added, “But how interesting.”My master said, “Bosh,” and turned to stare off into the garden.Coldmoon, though he grinned, said politely, “I would like, for my own future benefit, to hear the story of your ancient love.”“My story, too, contains elements of the mysterious.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Having passed through the Valley of the Bamboo Shoots at Kambara in Echigo, I was climbing up through the Pass of the Octopus Trap on my way to the Aizu territory.”“What odd-named places!” My master interrupts again.“Oh, do keep quiet and listen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"But in a romantic story such as this, one shouldn’t be too scrupulous over the logic of its details.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why, in one of Kyoka’s novels, you’ll find a crab crawling out of the snow.”“I see,” said Coldmoon who thereupon resumed his serious attitude of listening.“In those days I was outstandingly capable, really in the champion class, of eating ugly foods, but, being more or less wearied of locusts, slugs, red frogs, and such like, I thought snake-rice sounded like a welcome change.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So I told the old man I’d be delighted.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He then set a pot on the fire and put some rice inside it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

The only oddity was that there were about ten holes of various sizes in the lid of the pot.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Snakes, and all of them long ones, coiled up tight, as Coldmoon will appreciate, in their winter torpor.”“Please stop talking about such nasty things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s quite revolting,” says Mrs. Sneaze with a girlish shudder.“Oh I can’t possibly stop, for all these matters lie at the bottom of my broken-heartedness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, by and by, the old man lifted the pot’s lid with his left hand while with his other he nimbly grabbed up a wad of snakes from the basket.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He threw them into the pot and popped the lid back on.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And I must admit that, though I’m neither squeamish nor particularly scared of snakes, the old man’s nonchalant action did, at that moment, leave me gasping.”“Oh, please do stop.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I can’t stand gruesome stories.” Mrs. Sneaze is actually quite frightened.“Very soon now I’ll be coming to the broken-hearted bit, so please just do be patient.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, barely a minute had passed when, to my great surprise, a snake’s head popped out of a hole in the lid.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d barely realized what it was before another one popped its face out from a neighboring hole, and I’d barely registered that second head before another and another and another erupted into view until the whole lid was studded with snakes’ faces.”“Why did they stick their heads out?” asks my master.“Because, in agony, they were trying to crawl away from the heat building up inside the pot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After a while the old man said, speaking, naturally, in his local dialect, something like, ‘Right then, give ’em the old heave-ho.’ His wife said, ‘Aye’ and the girl said, ‘Yes’ and each of them, grasping a snake’s head firmly, gave it a savage yank.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"While the flesh remained in the pot, the head and a length of bones came waggling free in their hands.”“What you might call boned snake?” asks Coldmoon with a laugh.“Yes, indeed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Boned, or even spineless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But wasn’t it all exceedingly clever?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They lifted the lid, took a ladle, stirred the rice and the snake-flesh into one great wonderful mishmash and then invited me to tuck in.”“Did you actually eat it?” asks my master in a slightly edgy sort of voice.His wife makes a sour face and grumblingly complains.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I do so wish you’d all stop talking about it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m feeling sick right down to my stomach, and I shan’t dare eat for days.”“You only say that, Mrs. Sneaze, because you’ve never had the luck to taste snake-rice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you but tried it once, you’d never forget its exquisite flavor.”“Never.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nothing on earth could induce me to touch the nasty stuff.”“Anyway, I dined well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I forgot the bitter cold.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I studied the girl’s face to my heart’s content and, though I could happily have stared at her forever, when they suggested I should go to sleep, I remembered that I was in fact dog tired from my traveling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So I took their advice and laid down, and before long everything blurred and I was fast asleep.”“And what happened then?” This time it’s Mrs. Sneaze who urges him to continue.“When I woke up next morning, heartache had set in.”“Did anything happen to you?” asks Mrs. Sneaze.“No, nothing special happened to me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I just woke up and, while I was smoking a cigarette, I chanced to look out through the back window, and there I saw, washing its face in the water flowing from a bamboo-pipe, someone as bald as a kettle.”“The old man,” asks my master, “or the old woman?”“At first I couldn’t tell.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I sat there watching it in vague distaste for quite some time and, when at last the kettle turned towards me, I got the shock of my life.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For it was the girl to whom I had already lost my heart.”“But you said earlier that she wore her hair in the style of a marriageable girl,” my master promptly objects.“The night before, unmitigated beauty: in the morning, unmitigated kettle.”“Really!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What balderdash will you trot out next.” As is usual when he feels put out, my master stares at the ceiling.“Naturally, I was most deeply shocked, even a little frightened, but, making myself inconspicuous, I continued to watch.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At long last the kettle finished washing its face, featly donned the wig waiting on a nearby stone and then came tripping primly back to the hut.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I understood everything.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But though I understood, I have from that moment been a man incurably wretched, a man with a broken heart.”“The silliest broken heart that ever was.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Observe, my dear Coldmoon, how gay and lively he contrives to be despite his broken heart.”Turning toward Coldmoon, my master registers his low opinion of his friend’s disastrous love affair.“But,” says Coldmoon, “if the girl had not been bald, and if Waverhouse had brought her back with him to Tokyo, he might now be livelier than he is.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The fact remains that it is infinitely pitiable that the young lady happened to be bald.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But tell me, Waverhouse, how did it come about that a girl so young should have lost her hair?”“Well, naturally I’ve thought about that too, and I’m certain now that the depilation must be due entirely to over-indulgence in snake-rice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It goes to the head, you know.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It drives the blood upward, damaging the capillaries in the follicles of the scalp.”“I’m so glad nothing so terrible happened to you,” says Mrs. Sneaze with an undertone of sarcasm.“It is true that I was spared the affliction of going bald, but instead, as you can see, I have become a presbyope.” Taking off his goldrimmed spectacles, he polishes them carefully with his pocket handkerchief.There was a short silence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
To be a presbyope sounded so awful that none dared ask for an explanation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But my master, possibly being made of sterner stuff, possibly because he knows that nearsightedness is more often caused by the passing of the years than by one night’s meal of snake-rice, was not yet done.“I seem to remember,” he eventually said,“that you mentioned some mystery that would have moved the interest of Lafcadio Hearn.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What mystery?”“Did she buy the wig or simply pick it up, and, if she picked it up, where?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That,” said Waverhouse, replacing his spectacles on his nose, “is the mystery.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To this day I cannot work it out.”“It’s just like listening to a comic storyteller,” says Mrs. Sneaze.As Waverhouse’s improbable tale had come to its conclusion, I thought he might shut-up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But no.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He appears by nature incapable of keeping quiet unless actually gagged.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For he’s at it again already.“My disappointment in love was, of course, a bitter experience: but had I married that heavenly girl in ignorance of kettledom, the matter would have remained a lifelong cause of friction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One has to be careful.In matters like marriage, one tends only to discover at the very last moment hidden defects in unexpected places.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I therefore advise you, Coldmoon, not to waste your youth in futile yearnings or in pointless despair but to keep on grinding away at your balls of glass with an easy mind and heart.”“I’d be happy,” answers Coldmoon, “to do nothing more.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, the Goldfield ladies, to my considerable botheration, do keep on at me.”He grimaces in exaggerated annoyance.“True.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You are, in your case, somewhat put upon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But there are many comic cases of people thrusting themselves forward to invite disquiet.Take, for example, the case of Knarle-Damson, that well-known piddler upon seats of learning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His was extremely odd.”“What did he do?” asks my master, entering into the swing of the conversation.“Well, it was like this.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Once upon a long, long time ago, he stayed at the East-West Inn in Shizuoka.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just for one night, mind you, but that same evening he offered marriage to one of the servants working there.I myself am pretty easy-going, but I would not find it easy to go as far as that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The fact was, that in those days one of the maids at that Inn, they called her Summer, was a raving beauty, and it just so happened that she looked after Knarle-Damson’s room, so he could not help but meet her.”“The meeting was no doubt fated, just like yours in that something-or-other pass,” observes my master.“Yes, there is some resemblance between the cases.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, there are obvious similarities between Knarle-Damson and myself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, he proposed to this Summer girl but, before she gave her answer, he felt a need for watermelon.”“Huh?” My master looks puzzled.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And not only he, for both his wife and Coldmoon cock their heads sideways as they try to see the connection.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Waverhouse disregards them all and proceeds blithely with his story.“He summoned the girl and asked her if one could get a watermelon in Shizuoka.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She replied that, though the town was not as up-to-date as Tokyo, even in Shizuoka watermelons could be had, and almost immediately she brought him a tray heaped high with slices of the fruit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, while waiting for her answer, Knarle-Damson scoffed the lot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But before she gave her answer, Knarle-Damson got the gripes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He groaned away like mad but, since that didn’t help, he summoned the girl again and this time asked if there was a doctor available.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The girl replied that, though the town was not as up-to-date as Tokyo, still, even in Shizuoka, doctors were available, and in a matter of minutes she ushered one in to his room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The doctor, incidentally, had a very odd name, something like Heaven-and-Earth, anyway something obviously cribbed, for effect, from the Chinese classics.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, next morning when Knarle-Damson woke up, he was to find his gut-ache gone, and, some fifteen minutes before he was due to leave, he again summoned the Summer girl and asked for her answer to his proposal of marriage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The girl replied with laughter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She then said that down in Shizuoka it is possible to find doctors and watermelons at very short notice but that, even in Shizuoka, few find brides in a single night.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She turned, went out of the room and that was the last he saw of her.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And ever since that day, Knarle-Damson has remained, like me, a man scarred by a disappointment in love.Almost a recluse, he’ll only go to a library when pressed there by his bladder.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which all goes to show the wickedness and cruelty of women.”My master, most unusually, comes out this time in strong support of Waverhouse’s theme.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“How right you are,” he says, “how very right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just the other day I was reading one of de Musset’s plays in which some character quoted Ovid to the effect that, lighter than a feather is dust; than dust, wind; than wind, woman; but than woman, nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A very penetrating observation, isn’t it?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Women are indeed the dreaded end.” My master adopts an exceedingly cavalier attitude, but his wife, of course, is not going to let these flourishes pass unchallenged.“You complain about women being light, but I can’t see any particular merit in the fact that men are heavy.”“What do you mean by heavy?”“Heavy is just heavy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Like you.”“Why d’you say I’m heavy?”“Because you are heavy.Very heavy.”They’re off on one of their crazy arguments again.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For a time Waverhouse just sits there, listening with amusement to their increasingly bitter bickering, but eventually he opens his mouth.“The way you two go on at each other, hammering away until you’re red in the face, is perhaps the clearest possible demonstration that you truly are husband and wife.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m inclined to think that marriage in the old days was a less meaningful thing than it is today.” None of his listeners could tell whether he was teasing or complimenting his host and hostess but, since their bickering was halted, he could with profit have just stopped there.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But that’s not the way of a Waverhouse, who always has more to say.“I hear that in the old days no woman would have dreamt of answering back to her husband.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
From the man’s point of view it must have been like marriage to a deaf-mute.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wouldn’t have liked that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not one little bit.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I certainly prefer women who, like you, Mrs. Sneaze, have the spirit to retort,‘Because you are heavy,’ or something else in the same vein.If one is to be married, it would be insupportably boring never to have the liveliness of an occasional spat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My mother, for instance, spent her whole life saying,‘Yes’ and ‘You’re right’ to my frequently foolish father.She lived with him for twenty or so assenting years, and in all that stretch she never set foot outside the house except to go to a temple.Really, it’s too pitiful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Still, women in those days were not necessarily any better behaved than the women of today.You know, Mrs. Sneaze, people talk down their noses about the depraved conduct of modern, girl students, but the truth is that things were very much worse in those so-called good old days.”“Really?” Mrs. Sneaze is serious.“Of course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"You remember?”“I don’t remember anything of the sort.”“I don’t know how things were in your part of the country, but that’s most certainly the way it was in Shizuoka.”“Surely not,” murmurs Mrs. Sneaze.“Do you mean that for a fact?” asks Coldmoon in a tone of voice that shows he can’t quite credit it.“For an absolute, rock hard fact.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"The chief clerk’s name is Jimbei, and he sits at his counter with the invariable expression of a man who’s lost his mother only three days back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sitting right beside Jimbei you’ll find a young man of twenty-four, maybe twenty-five, whose name is Hatsu.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Hatsu’s very pale.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He looks like one of those novices who, in demonstration of their devotion to the thirty-third priest-prince of the Shingon Sect, take nothing but buckwheat-water for twenty-one days at a stretch.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And next to Hatsu there’s Chodon.Chodon’s the one who’s hunched dejectedly above his abacus as though but yesterday he lost his home in a fire.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

“Is this a chanting of the genealogy of your draper or is it a tale about the maiden-mongers of Shizuoka?”“Ah yes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was telling you the story of the maiden-mongers.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As a matter of fact, there’s an extremely strange story I was going to tell you about that draper’s, but I’ll cut it out and concentrate on the sellers of little girls.”“Why not cut that too?” suggests my master.“Oh no!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wouldn’t feel right if I abandoned that story.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For it provides exceedingly valuable data by which to compare the characters of modern women with those of their predecessors in the early Meiji Era.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, as I was saying, when my father and I arrived in front of Isegen, the maiden-monger addressed my father in these terms: ‘’ow about one of these ’ere little leftovers?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Take a toddler, sir, and I’ll make ’er special cheap.’ He’s put his shoulder-pole down on the ground and is wiping sweat from his brow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"My father taps on their heads as one might rap a melon and says,‘Yes, they sound quite good.’ The negotiations then begin in earnest and, after a great deal of chaffering, my father finally says,‘That’s all very well, but can you guarantee their quality?’ ‘Yes,’ says the man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"“Women today, on their way to and from schools, at concerts, at charity parties and at garden parties, are, in effect, already selling themselves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Their light behavior is tantamount to such statements as, ‘Hey, how about buying me?’ or ‘Oh, so you’re not much interested!’There is accordingly no contemporary need for hawkers or other middlemen selling on commission, and the street cries of our modern cities are of course the poorer by the disappearance of maiden-mongers shouting their wares.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such changes are bound to follow from the introduction and dissemination of modern ideas of the individual’s independence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The older generation get unnecessarily worked up and moan and groan as though the world were coming to its end, but that’s the trend of modern civilization and I, for one, welcome and encourage these changes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"That way, one can easily end up husbandless and, even after fifty or sixty years of assiduous search, still not be a bride.”Coldmoon, very much a bright young man of this twentieth century, spoke for his generation and, having so spoken, blew cigarette smoke into Waverhouse’s face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But Waverhouse is not a man to flinch from a mere residue of burnt tobacco.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“As you say,” he responded, “among schoolgirls and young ladies, nowadays their very flesh and bones are permeated with, if not actually manufactured out of, self-esteem and self-confidence, and it is indeed admirable that they should prove themselves a match for men in every possible field.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

lt just so happens that almost everything aesthetically beautiful seems to have originated in Greece.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Aesthetics and the Greeks: you speak of one and you are speaking of the other.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I see those dark-skinned girls putting their whole hearts into their gymnastics, into my mind, invariably, leaps the story of Agnodice.” He’s wearing his font-of-all-wisdom face as he babbles on and on.“So you’ve managed to find another of those awkward names,” says Coldmoon with his usual, witless grin.“Agnodice was a wonderful woman.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I look back at her across the gulf of centuries, still I am impressed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In those far days the Laws of Athens forbade women to be midwives.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Isn’t there any way I can?’ So she thought and thought, doing nothing else for three straight days and nights, and just at dawn on the third day, as she heard the yowling of a babe newborn next door, the solution flashed upon her.She immediately cut off her long hair, dressed herself as a man, and took to attending the lectures on childbirth then being given by the eminent Hierophilus.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

She was hauled before the courts.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And she stood in danger of the direst punishment for breaking the laws of Athens.”“You sound just like a professional storyteller,” says Mrs. Sneaze.“Aren’t I good?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well then, at that point all the women of Athens got together and signed such an enormous round robin in support of Agnodice that the magistrates felt unable to ignore it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the end she was let off, and the laws were changed to allow women to become midwives, and they all lived happily ever after.”“You do know about so many things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s wonderful,” sighs Mrs. Sneaze.“True.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

another visitor!” squeaked Mrs. Sneaze and scuttled off into the living room.And who should it be but our old friend Beauchamp Blowlamp.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
With his arrival the entire cast of the eccentrics who haunt my master’s house was gathered upon stage.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Lest that should sound ungracious, perhaps I could better emphasize that sufficient eccentrics are gathered to keep a cat amused, and it would indeed be ungracious if I were not satisfied with that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Even in this vast city, such personages are rare, and I take it as the highest accolade that I am accepted by them as one of their company.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is only the consciousness of that honor that enables me to forget the hardship of being condemned to endure this heat in a fur bag.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And I am especially grateful thus to be kept amused for a whole half-day.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whenever the four of them get together like this, something entertaining is bound to transpire, so I watch them respectfully from that draft-cooled place by the door to which I have retired.“I’m afraid I haven’t been around to see you for quite some time,” says Beauchamp with a modest bow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His head, I notice, shines as brightly as it did the other day.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Judged by his head alone, he might be taken for a second-rate actor, but the ceremonious manner in which he wears his very stiff white cotton hakama makes him look like nothing so much as a student-swordsman from the fencing-school of Sakakibara Kenkichi.Indeed, the only part of Beauchamp’s body which looks in the least bit normal is the section between his hips and his shoulders.“Well, how nice of you to call.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In this hot weather, too.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Come right in.”Waverhouse, as usual, plays the host in someone else’s home.“I haven’t seen you for a long time, sir,” Beauchamp says to him.“Quite so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not, I believe, since that Reading Party last spring.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Are you still active in that line?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Have you again performed the part of a high-class prostitute?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You did it very well.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I applauded you like mad.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Did you notice?”“Yes, I was much encouraged.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Your kind appreciation gave me the strength to carry on until the end.”“When are you having your next meeting?” interjects my master.“We rest during July and August but we hope to be livening up again in September.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Can you suggest anything interesting we might tackle?”“Well,” my master answers half-heartedly.“Look here, Beauchamp,” says Coldmoon suddenly, “Why don’t you try my piece?”“If it’s yours, it must be interesting, but what’s this piece you’ve written?”“A drama,” says Coldmoon with all the brass-faced equanimity he could muster.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His three companions are dumbfounded, and stare upon him with looks of unanimous wonder.“A drama!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Good for you!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A comedy or tragedy?” Beauchamp was the first to recover and find his tongue.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
With the utmost composure.Coldmoon gives his reply.“It’s neither a comedy nor a tragedy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since people these days are always fussing about whether a play should be old-style drama or new-style drama, I decided to invent a totally new type and have accordingly written what I call a haiku-play.”“What on earth’s a haiku-play?”“A play imbued with the spirit of haiku.” My master and Waverhouse, apparently dazed by the concept of an essentially tiny poem blown out to the length of a play, say nothing, but Beauchamp presses on.“How do you implement that interesting idea?”“Well, since the work is of the haiku mode, I decided it should not be too lengthy or too viciously clear-cut.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is accordingly a one act play, in fact a single scene.”“I understand.”“Let me first describe the setting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It must, of course, be very simple.I envisage one big willow in the center of the stage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
From its trunk a single branch extends stage-right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And on that branch there’s a crow.”“Won’t the crow fly off?” says my master worriedly, as if talking to himself.“That’s no problem.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One just ties the crow’s leg to the branch with a stoutish bit of string.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, underneath the branch there’s a wooden bathtub.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And in the bathtub, sitting sideways, there’s a beautiful woman washing herself with a cotton towel.”“That’s a bit decadent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Besides, who could you get to play the woman?” asks Waverhouse.“Again, no problem.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just hire a model from an art school.”“The Metropolitan Police Bureau will undoubtedly prove sticky.” My master’s worriment is not allayed.“But it ought to be all right so long as one doesn’t present this work of art as some form of show.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If this were the sort of thing that the police get sticky about, it would be impossible ever to draw from the nude.”“But nude models are provided for students to study, not just to stare at.”“If you scholars, the intellectual cream of Japan, remain so straight-laced in your ancient bigotry, there’s no real hope for the future of Japan.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What’s the distinction between painting and drama?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Are they not both arts?” Coldmoon, very evidently enjoying himself, lashes out at the prudery of his listeners.“Well, let’s leave all that for the moment,” says Beauchamp, “but tell us how your play proceeds.” He may not intend to use the play, but he clearly wants to know how that promising opening scene will be developed.“Enter the haiku-poet Takahama Kyoshi.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He advances along the ramp leading to the stage carrying a walking stick and wearing a white pith-helmet.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Under his silk-gauze surcoat, his white kimono, patterned with colored splashes, is tucked up at the back, and he wears shoes in the Western style.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is thus costumed to look like a contractor of Army supplies but, being a haiku-poet, he must walk in a leisurely manner looking as though deeply absorbed in the composition of a poem.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he reaches the main stage, he notices first the willow tree and then the light-skinned lady in her bath.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Startled, he looks up and sees the crow peering down at her from its long branch.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At this point the poet strikes a pose, which should be held for at least fifty seconds, to indicate how deeply he is moved by the refined haiku-like effect of the scene before him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then in a deep resonant voice he declaims:“A crowIs in loveWith a woman in a bath”As soon as the last word has been spoken, the clappers are cracked and the curtain falls.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well now, what do you think of it?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t you like it?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I need hardly say that any sensible man would rather play the part of a haiku-poet than that of a high-class tart.”Beauchamp, however, looks undecided and comments with a serious face, “It seems too short.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I think it needs a little more action, something that will add real human interest.”Waverhouse, who has so far been keeping comparatively quiet, can hardly be expected indefinitely to pass up such a splendid opportunity for the display of his peculiar talents.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“So that wee bit of a thing is what you call a haiku-play?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Quite awful!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ueda Bin is constantly pointing out in his essays and articles that the spirit of haiku, as also indeed the comic spirit, lacks constructive positivism.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He argues that they undermine the morals and hence the morale of the Japanese nation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And, as one would expect, whatever Bin points out is very much to the point.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’d have you laughed out of town if you dared risk staging such an artsy-craftsy bit of rubbish.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any case, it’s all so uncleancut that no one could tell whether it’s meant to be straight theater or burlesque.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A thing so indeterminate could, in fact, be anything.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Forgive me that I take the liberty of saying so, my dear Coldmoon, but I really do think you’d do better to stay in your laboratory and limit your creativity to the grinding of glass balls.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You could, I’m sure, write hundreds of such plays but, since they could achieve nothing but the ruin of our nation, what would be the point?”Coldmoon looks slightly huffed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Do you think its effect is as demoralizing as all that?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Myself, I think it’s constructive, positivist, definitely yea-saying.” He is seeking to vindicate something too unimportant to merit vindication.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“The point is that Kyoshi actually makes the crow fall in love with the woman.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His lines having that effect are, I consider, an affirmation of life, and that, I think, is very positivist.”“Now that,” says Waverhouse, “is a totally new approach.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A novel concept casting fresh light upon dramatic theory.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We must listen with the deepest attention.”“As a bachelor of science, such an idea as that of a crow falling in love with a woman strikes me as illogical.”“Quite so.”“But this illogicality is expressed with such consummate artistry that it does not seem in the least illogical to the audience.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The effect of great dramatic artistry is, in fact, to impose upon the listener a willing suspension of disbelief.”“I doubt it,” says my master in tones of the deepest dubiety, but Coldmoon pays him no heed.“You ask why the unreasonable should not sound unreasonable?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, when I have given the psychological explanation, you will understand why.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, the emotion of being in love, or of not being in love can only be experienced by the poet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It has nothing whatsoever to do with the crow.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Similarly, the concept of a crow in love is not a concept likely to cross the mind of a crow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In short, it is the poet himself who is in love with the woman.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The moment Kyoshi clapped eyes on her he must have fallen head over heels in love.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He then sees the crow sitting immobile on the branch and staring down at her.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being himself smitten with love for the lady, he assumes that the crow is similarly moved.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is, of course, mistaken, but nevertheless, indeed for that very reason, the basic idea of the play is not simply literary, but positivist as well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I would in particular suggest that the manner in which the poet, while still contriving himself to appear objective and heart-free, transposes his own sentiments to become crow-sentiments is indisputably yea-saying and positivist.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I ask you, gentlemen, am I not right?”“It’s a well-turned argument,” says Waverhouse, “but I bet it would leave Kyoshi, if he ever heard it, distinctly taken aback.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I accept that your exposition of the play is positivist but, if the play were to be staged, the audience reaction would undoubtedly be negative.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Don’t you agree, Beauchamp?”“Yes, I confess I think it’s a little too negative.” Beauchamp confesses with due critical gravity.My master seems to think things have gone far enough and, to ease the pressure upon his favorite disciple, he seeks to lead the conversation away from Coldmoon’s ill-received venture into the literary field.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“But tell me, Beauchamp,” he says, “have you perhaps written any new masterpieces recently?”“Nothing really worth showing you, but I am, in fact, thinking of publishing a collection of them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Luckily, I chance to have the manuscript with me, and I’d welcome your opinion of these trifles I’ve composed.” He thereupon produced from his breast a package wrapped in a cloth of purple crepe.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Loosening the material, he carefully extracted a notebook some fifty or sixty pages thick which he proceeded to deposit, reverently, before my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master assumes his most magisterial mien and then, with a grave “Allow me,” opens the book.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There, on the first page, stands an inscription:DedicatedTo the frail OpulaMy master stared at the page, wordless and with an enigmatic expression on his face, for such a long time that Waverhouse peered across from beside him.“What have we here?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
New-style poetry?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Aha!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Already dedicated!How splendid of you, Beauchamp,” he says with all the enthusiasm of a hound on the scent, “to come out bang with so bold a dedication.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To, if my eyes do not deceive me, a certain Opula?”My master, now looking more puzzled than enigmatic, turns to the poet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“My dear Beauchamp,” he says, “this Opula, is she a real person?”“Oh yes indeed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She’s one of the young ladies whom I invited to our last Reading Party, the one where Waverhouse so generously applauded me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She lives, in fact, in this neighborhood.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Actually, I called at her home on my way here but learnt, to my sorrow, that she’s been away since last month.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I gather that the whole family is spending the summer at Oiso.”Beauchamp looks peculiarly solemn as, with corroborative detail, he affirms the reality of his dedication.“Come now, Sneaze, don’t go pulling a long face like that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This is the twentieth century and you’d best get used to it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let’s get down to considering the masterpiece.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First of all, Beauchamp, this dedication seems a bit of a bosh shot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What do you mean by ‘frail’?”“Well, I meant ‘frail’ in the romantic sense, to convey the idea of a person infinitely delicate, infinitely refined and ethereal.”“Did you now.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, the word can, of course, be so used but it does have other, coarser connotations.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Especially if it were read as an adjectival noun, you could be thought to be calling her some sort of franion.So if I were you, I’d rephrase it.”“Could you suggest how?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d like it to be unmisinterpretably poetic.”“Well, I think I’d say something like ‘Dedicated to all that’s frail beneath the nares of Opula.’ It wouldn’t involve much change in wording, but yet it makes an enormous difference in the feeling.”“I see,” says Beauchamp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"While it is quite clear that he doesn’t understand the balderdash proposed by Waverhouse, he is trying hard to look as though he had grasped, considered, and accepted it.My master, who has been sitting silently, turns the first page and begins to read aloud from the opening section.“In the fragrance of that incense which I burn.When I am weary, seeminglyYour soul trails in the smoky twist and turnOf love requited.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Woe, ah woe is me,Who in a world as bitter as is thisMust in a mist of useless yearning yearnFor the sweet fire of your impassioned kiss.“This, I’m afraid,” he says with a sigh, “is a bit beyond me,” and he passes the notebook along to Waverhouse.“The effect is strained, the imagery too heightened,” says Waverhouse passing it on to Coldmoon.“I .",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"e,” says Coldmoon, and returns it to the author.“It’s only natural that you should fail to understand it.” Beauchamp leaps to his own defense.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“In the last ten years the world of poetry has advanced and altered out of all recognition.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Modern poetry is not easy.You can’t understand it if you do no more than glance through it in bed or while you’re waiting at a railway station.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"More often than not, modern poets are unable to answer even the simplest questions about their own work.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such poets write by direct inspiration, and are not to be held responsible for more than the writing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Annotation, critical commentary, and exegesis, all these may be left to the scholars.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We poets are not to be bothered with such trivia.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only the other day some fellow with a name like Sōseki published a short story entitled ‘A Single Night.’ But it’s so vague that no one could make head or tail of it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I eventually got hold of the man and questioned him very seriously about the real meaning of his story.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He not only refused to give any explanation, but even implied that, if the story happened in fact to have any meaning at all, he couldn’t care less.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His attitude was, I think, typical of a modern poet.”“He may be a poet, but he sounds, doesn’t he, downright odd,” observes my master.“He’s a fool.”Waverhouse demolishes this Sōseki in one curt breath.Beauchamp, however, has by no means finished defending the merits of his own daft poem.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Nobody in our poetry group is in any way associated with this Sōseki fellow, and it would be unreasonable if you gentlemen were to condemn my poems by reason of some such imagined association.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I took great pains with the construction of this work, and I would like in particular to draw your attention to my telling contrast of this bitter world with the sweetness of a kiss.”“The pains you must have taken,” says my master somewhat ambiguously, “have not gone unremarked.”“Indeed,” says Waverhouse, “the skill with which you have made ‘bitter’ and ‘sweet’ reflect each other is as interesting as if you had spiced each syllable of a haiku with seventeen different peppery tastes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The saying speaks of only seven such peppery tangs but, so tasteful, Beauchamp, is the concoction you’ve cooked up, that no saying is sufficient to say how inimitable it is, and how totally lost I am in admiration of your art.”Rather unkindly, Waverhouse diverts himself at the expense of an honest man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Possibly for that reason, my master suddenly got to his feet and went off into his study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Possibly not, for he quickly re-emerged with a piece of paper in his hand.“Now that we’ve considered Coldmoon’s play and Beauchamp’s poem, perhaps you will grant me the boon of your expert comments on this little thing here that I’ve written.” My master looks as if he means what he says to be taken seriously.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If so, he is to be immediately disappointed.“If it’s that epitaph thing for Mr. the-late and-sainted Natural Man, I’ve heard it twice already.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If not thrice,” says Waverhouse dismissingly.“For heaven’s sake,Waverhouse, why don’t you just pipe down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, Beauchamp, I’d like you to understand that this is not an example of my best and serious work.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I wrote it just for fun, so I’m not especially proud of it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But let’s just see if you like it.”“I’d be delighted to hear it.”“You too, Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since you’re here, you might as well listen.”“Of course, but it’s not long, is it?”“Very short.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I doubt,” says my master quite untruthfully, “whether it contains as many as three score words and ten,” whereupon, giving no opportunity for further interruptions, he launches out upon a recital of his homespun master-work.“‘The Spirit of Japan,’ cries Japanese man;‘Long may it live,’ cries heBut his cry breaks off in that kind of coughWhich comes from the soul’s T.B.”“What a magnificient opening,” burbles Coldmoon with real enthusiasm.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“The theme rises before one, immediate, undodgeable, and imposing, like a mountain!”“‘The Spirit of Japan,’ scream the papers,Pickpockets scream it too:In one great jump the Japanese SpiritCrosses the ocean blueAnd is lectured upon in England,While a play on this staggering themeIs a huge success on the German stage.A huge success?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A scream!”“Splendid,” says Waverhouse, letting his head fall backwards in token of his approbation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“It’s even better than that epiphanic epitaph.”“Admiral Tōgō has the Japanese Spirit,So has the man in the street:Fish shop managers, swindlers, murderers,None would be complete,None would be the men they are,None would be a manIf he wasn’t wrapped up like a tuppenny cupIn the Spirit of Japan”“Please,” breathes Coldmoon, “please do mention that Coldmoon has it too.”“But if you ask what this Spirit isThey give that cough and say‘The Spirit of Japan is the Japanese Spirit,’Then they walk awayAnd when they’ve walked ten yards or soThey clear their throats of phlegm,And that clearing sound is the Japanese Spirit Manifest in them.”“Oh I like that,” says Waverhouse, “that’s a very well-turned phrase.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze, you’ve got talent, real literary talent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And the next stanza?”“Is the Spirit of Japan triangular?Is it, do you think, a square?Why no indeed!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As the words themselvesExplicitly declare,It’s an airy, fairy, spiritual thingAnd things that close to GodCan’t be defined in a formulaOr measured with a measuring-rod.”“It’s certainly an interesting composition and most unusual in that, defying tradition, it has a strong didactic element.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But don’t you think it contains too many Spirits of Japan.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One can have,” says Beauchamp mildly, “too much of the best of things.”“A good point.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I agree.”Waverhouse chips in yet again with two-pen-nyworth of tar.“There’s not one man in the whole of JapanWho has not used the phrase,But I have not met one user yetWho knows what it conveys.The Spirit of Japan, the Japanese Spirit,Could it conceivably beNothing but another of those long-nosed goblins Only the mad can see?”My master comes to the end of his poem and, believing it pregnant with eminently debatable material, sits back in expectation of an ava-lanche of comment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, though the piece is undoubtedly that masterpiece for which the anthologists have been waiting, its endless Western form and its lack of clear meaning have resulted in the present audience not realizing that the recitation is over.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They, accordingly, just sit there.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For a long time.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Eventually, no more verses being vouchsafed them, Coldmoon ventures “Is that all?”My master answers with a noncommittal, I thought falsely carefree, kind of throaty grunt.Very much contrary to my own expectations, Waverhouse failed to rise to the occasion with one of his usual flights of fantastication.Instead, after a brief interval, he turned to my master and said, “How about collecting some of your shorter pieces into a book?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then you, too, could dedicate it to someone.”“How about to you?” my master flippantly suggests.“Not on your life,” says Waverhouse very firmly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He takes out the scissors which he had earlier analyzed for the benefit of Mrs. Sneaze and begins clipping away at his fingernails.Coldmoon turns to Beauchamp and, somewhat cautiously, enquires,“Are you closely acquainted with Miss Opula Goldfield?”“After I invited her to our Reading Party last spring, we became friends and we now see quite a lot of each other.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whenever I’m with her I feel, as it were, inspired, and even after we’ve parted, I still feel, at least for quite a time, such a flame alight within me that poems, both in the traditional forms and in the modern style, come singing up like steam from a kettle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I believe that this little collection contains so high a proportion of love poems precisely because I am so deeply stirred by women and, in particular, by her.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The only way I know by which to express my sincere gratitude is by dedicating this book to the source of its inspiration.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I stand at the end of a long tradition inasmuch as, since time immemorial, no poet wrote fine poetry save under the inspiration of some deeply cherished woman.”“Is that indeed so?” says Coldmoon as though he had just learnt a fact of imponderable gravity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But deep behind the sober skin of his face I could see him laughing at the folly of his friend.Even this gathering of gasbags cannot wheeze on forever, and the pressure of their conversation is now fast whimpering down toward exhaustion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being under no obligation to listen all day long to their endless blather, their carping and flapdoodle, I excused myself and went out into the garden in search of a praying mantis.The sun is going down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Its reddened light, filtered through the green foliage of a sultan’s parasol, flecks the ground in patches.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"High up on the trunk of the tree, cicadas are singing their hearts out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tonight, perhaps, a little rain may fall.IVI HAVE,of late,taken to taking exercise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To those who may sneer at me saying, “What sauce, a mere cat taking exercise indeed!” I would like to address you with the few following words.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was not until recently that human beings, previously content to regard eating and sleeping as their only purposes in life, began to grasp the point of taking exercise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Let all mankind remember in what self-complacent idleness they used to pass their days; how passionately they once believed that impassivity of mind and body were the signs of a noble soul, and that the honor of a nobleman resided in his ability to do nothing more strenuous than to plant his bum on a cushion that there it might, in comfort, rot away.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is only recently that, like some infectious disease brought from the West to this pure land of the gods, a stream of silly injunctions has been sprayed upon us to take exercise, to gulp milk, to shower ourselves with freezing water, to plonk ourselves in the sea, and, in the summertime, to sequester ourselves in the mountains on a diet, allegedly healthy, of nothing more solid than mist.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such importations seem to me about as salubrious as the black plague, tuberculosis, and that very Western malady, neurasthenia.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, since I am only one year old, born as I was last year, I cannot personally testify as to the state of affairs when human beings here first began to suffer from these sicknesses.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It happened at a time before I came to float along in this vale of tears.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, one may fairly equate a cat’s one year, with ten for human beings: and though our span of life is two or three times shorter than theirs, a cat may still therein achieve full feline self-development.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It follows that any evaluation of a cat’s life and a man’s life by reference to a common time-scale must result in grievous error.That point is surely proven by the fact that I, who am but a year and a few months old, possess the discernment to make such an analysis.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In contrast, the third daughter of my master, whom I understand to be already in her third year, is lamentably backward, a laggard in all learning, a slow-coach in development.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her accomplishments are limited.She yowls, she mucks her bed and she sucks milk from her mother.Compared with someone like myself who am distressed by the state of the world and deplore the degeneracy of the age, that girl is truly infantile.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is consequently not in the least surprising that I should have stored away, deep within my mind, the entire history of taking exercise, of sea-bathing, and of going away for a change of air.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If there should be anyone surprised at a thing so trifling as this vast extent of my knowledge, it could only be another of those handicapped humans, those stumbling creatures whom heaven has retarded with the gift of no more than a measly couple of legs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From time immemorial man has been a slow-coach, so it is only very recently that such inveterate sluggards have begun to recommend the virtues of exercise, and, as if the notion were their own incredible discovery, to babble endlessly of the benefits of bobbing about in the sea.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Per contra, I was aware of such things in my pre-natal condition, and to fully realize the benisons of brine one needs but walk on a beach.Precisely how many fish are frolicking about in so vast a volume of water, I would not care to guess; however it is certain that not a single specimen has ever fallen so sick as to need the attentions of a doctor.There they all are, swimming about in the best of health.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When a fish does catch some illness, its body first becomes helpless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But let it be remembered that the death of a fish is described in Japanese as an ascen-sion.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Birds, we say, drop dead, become mere fallen things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Men are simply said to have kicked the bucket.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But fish, I stress, ascend.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, just ask anyone who’s journeyed overseas, anyone who’s crossed the Indian Ocean, whether they’ve seen a dying fish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Of course they haven’t.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And no wonder.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However often you might plow back and forth across that endless waste of water, never would you see afloat upon its waves one single fish that had just given up its last breath.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Given up, I should perhaps fish-pertinently say, its last seawater gulp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Had you assiduously searched since time began, were you now to go on steaming day and night up and down that wide and boundless expanse of water, not one solitary fish would ever be seen to ascend.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since fish do not ascend, their undying strength, their hardihood, indeed their deathlessness, is easily deduced.How comes it, then, that fish should be so death defyingly hardy?Here once again, mankind can give no answer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the answer, as I shortly shall disclose, is simplicity itself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The answer is that fish are hardy because they incessantly bathe in the sea, because they swill saltwater.It’s as simple as that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, since the benefits of sea bathing are so evidenced by fish, surely it must follow that the practice would be beneficial to mankind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Lo and behold, in 1750 a certain Dr. Richard Russell came out with the humanly exaggerated pronouncement that anyone who jumped into the sea at Brighton would find that all his various diseases would be cured on the spot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is it not laughable that it took mankind so long to arrive at so simple a conclusion?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even we cats, when the time is ripe, intend to go down to the seaside, to some place like Kaniakura.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But now is not the time.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There is always a right time for everything.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as the Japanese people before the Restoration of the Emperor, both lived and died without benefit of sea bathing, so cats today have not yet reached the appropriate stage for leaping naked into the briny deep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Timing is all important, and a hurried job is a job half-botched.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, since no cat taken today to be drowned in some shrine’s canal will ever come home safely, it would be most imprudent indeed for me to go plunging in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Until by the laws of evolution we cats have developed the characteristics needed to resist the rage of overwhelming waves; until, in fact, a dead cat can be said not to have died but, like fish, to have ascended, until that happy day, I won’t go near the water.Postponing my sea bathing to some later date, I have anyway decided to make a start on some sort of exercise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In this enlightened twentieth century, any failure to take exercise is likely to be interpreted as a sign of pauperdom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which would be bad for one’s reputation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you don’t take exercise, you will be judged incapable of taking it by reason of an inability to afford either the time or the expense, or both.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is thus no longer a simple question of not taking exercise.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In olden times those who did take physical exercise, persons such as the riffraff of male servants in an upper-class household, were regarded with a proper scorn.But nowadays it is precisely those who do not take some form of physical exercise at whom the world turns up its nose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The world’s evalua-tions of an individual’s social worth, like the slits in my eyeballs, change with time and circumstance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In point of fact my pupil-slits vary but modestly between broad and narrow, but mankind’s value judgements turn somersaults and cartwheels for no conceivable reason.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Still, now that I come to think of it, there may perhaps be sense in such peculiar topsy-turvydom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For just as there are two ends to every string, there are two sides to every question.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps in its extreme adaptability mankind has found a way to make apparent opposites come out with identical meanings.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, if one takes the symbols meaning “idea” and turns them upside-down, one finds oneself with the symbols meaning “plan.”Charming, isn’t it?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A similar conception can be seen at work in the Japanese practice of viewing the so-called Bridge of Heaven by bending down and peering backward between one’s parted legs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Seen thus, the sea and its reflection of the pine-trees on the sandbar appear like true pines reared into the sky, whereas the true pines and the sky appear as trees reflected upon the water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is indeed a remarkable effect.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even the works of Shakespeare might be more thoroughly appreciated if they were re-examined from unorthodox positions.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Someone, once in a while, should take a good long look at Hamlet through his legs.Presented upside-down, that tragedy might earn the bald remark “Ye Gods, this play is bad.” How else, except by standing on their heads, can the critics in our literary world make any progress?Considered against that background, it is hardly surprising that those who once spoke ill of physical exercise should suddenly go crazy about sports, that even women should walk about on the streets with tennis rackets clutched in their hands.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So far as I’m concerned, I have no criticisms to offer on any of these matters provided no misguided human being has the effrontery to criticize a cat for the sauciness of its interest in taking physical exercise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That said, perhaps I ought to satisfy your probable curiosity, to offer some explanation of the exercise I take.As you are aware, it is my misfortune that my paws cannot grasp any kind of implement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am consequently unable to pick up balls or to grip such things as bats and bloody rackets.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Moreover, even could I handle them, I cannot buy them for I don’t have any money.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For these two reasons, I have chosen such kinds of exercise as cost nothing and need no special equipment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I suppose you might consequently assume that my idea of exercise must be limited to merely walking about, or to running away like Rickshaw Blacky with a slice of stolen tuna fish jammed in my jaws.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But to swagger about on the ground by the mere mechanical movement of four legs and in strict obedience to the laws of gravity, that is all too simple; simple and therefore totally uninteresting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There is indeed one kind of exercise called “movements” in which my master occasionally indulges.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But it is, in fact, no more than its name suggests, a matter of mere mechanical movements.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which, to my mind, is a des-ecration of the sanctity of exercise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, if some true incentive is involved, I do not always scorn the simplicities of mere movement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For example, I get real pleasure from racing for dried bonito and from going on salmon hunts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But those activities are related to specific objectives.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If the incentives are removed, the activities become mere waste of spirit, ashes in the mouth.When there is no prize to provide the needed stimulus, then my preference is for exercises that demand some kind of genuine skill.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I have devised a variety of exercises satisfying that requirement.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One is jumping from the kitchen-eaves up and onto the main roof of the house.Another is standing with all four legs together on the plum-blossom shape of the narrow tile at the very top of the roof.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An especially difficult feat is walking along the laundry pole, which usually proves a failure because my claws can’t penetrate the hard and slippery surface of bamboo.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps my most interesting exercise is jumping suddenly from behind onto the children’s backs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, unless I am extremely careful about the method and timing of such exploits, the penalties involved can be uncommonly painful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I derive so very little pleasure from having my head stuffed deep in a paperbag that I only risk this splendid exercise three times, at most, in a month.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One must also recognize the disadvantage that any success in this form of exercise depends entirely, and unsatisfactorily, upon the availability of some human partner.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Yet another form of exercise is clawing the covers of books.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In this case two kinds of snags arise.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First, there is the invariable drubbing administered by my master whenever he catches me at it.Secondly, though the exercise undoubtedly develops a certain dexterity of finger, it does nothing at all for the remaining muscles of my body.I have so far only described those comparatively crude activities which I would choose to call old-fashioned exercises.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, my newfangled sports include a few of the most exquisite refinement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First among such sports comes hunting the praying mantis, which is only less noble than hunting rats by the lesser degree of its dangers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The open season, with the quarry in superb condition, runs from high mid-summer until early in the autumn.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The hunting rules are as follows.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
First one goes to the garden to flush one’s quarry out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Given the proper weather, one may expect to find at least a brace of them browsing in the open.Next, having chosen one particular mantis, a sudden dash, a regular windslicer, is made towards the quarry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The mantis, thus alerted to its danger, rears its head and readies for the fray.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For all its puniness, the mantis, at least until it realizes the hopelessness of any further resistance, is a plucky little beast, and its fatuous readiness to make a fight of it adds zest to the fun.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I, accordingly, open by patting him lightly on the head with the flat of my right, front paw.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The head is soft and is generally cocked to one side.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At this point, the expression on the quarry’s face adds singular edge to my pleasure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The beast is clearly puzzled.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I immediately spring around behind him and, from that new position, lightly claw at his wings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"These wings are normally folded carefully close but, if clawed with exactly the right degree of scratchiness, they can be har-rowed loose, and from beneath the beast a disheveled flurry of underwear, a yellowish tatter of stuff like thin transparent paper, droops flimsy into view.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Oh, what an elegant fellow!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Tricked out in double lined clothing even at the height of summer!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And may it bring him luck!Invariably, at this moment the mantis twists his long, green neck around to face me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, turning his whole body in the same direction, sometimes he defiantly advances and sometimes simply stands there like some dwarf-annoyed giraffe.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
If he remains transfixed in that latter attitude I shall be cheated of my exercise.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, having given him every chance to take the initiative, I then give him a stimulating smack.If the mantis happens to have the least intelligence, he will now attempt escape, but some, ill-schooled and of a barbarous ferocity, will persevere in derring-do, even to the point of launching an attack.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When dealing with such savages, I carefully calculate the precisely proper moment to strike back and then, suddenly, deliver a really heavy blow as he advances at me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I would say that on such occasions the beast is usually batted sideways for a distance of between two and three feet.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, if my quarry displays a civilized recognition of its plight and drags away in pitiful retreat, then I am moved to pity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Off I go, racing along like a flying bird, two or three times around a convenient tree in the garden.Yet, when I return I rarely find that the mantis has managed to crawl away more than five or six inches.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now conscious of my power, he has no stomach for continued battle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He staggers away, tottering first left and then right in dazed attempts to escape me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Matching his movements, this way and that, I harry him back and forth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sometimes in his ultimate despair, he makes the ultimate effort of fluttering his wings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is the nature of the wings, as of the neck, of a praying mantis to be exceedingly long and exceedingly slender.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I understand that these wings are entirely ornamental and are of no more practical use to a praying mantis than are, to a human being, the English, French, and German languages.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It follows that, however ultimate his effort, however grand his pitiful remonstrance, no fluttering of those ineffectual wings can have on me the very least effect.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One speaks of his effort but, in reality, there’s nothing so purposeful about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One should not use a word so energetic to describe the shambling totter, torn wings a-drag along the ground, of this pathetic creature.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For I confess that I really do feel a wee mite sorry for my miserable antagonist.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, my need for physical exercise outweighs all other considerations, and into every life, even that of a mantis, a little rain must fall.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My conscience salved, I dart beyond him from behind, twist, and so confront him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In his condition, having committed himself to forward movement, he has no choice but to keep coming.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Equally and naturally, faced with such aggression, I have no choice but to give him a whack on the nose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My foe collapses, falls down flat with his wings spread out on either side.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Extending a front paw, I hold him down in that squashed-face position whilst I take a little breather.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Myself at ease again, I let the wretched perisher get up and struggle on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, again, I catch him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My strategy is based, of course, on the classic Chinese methods of Kung Ming, that military marvel of the Shu Kingdom in the third century, who, seven times in succession, first caught, then freed, his enemy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For maybe thirty minutes I pursue that classic alternation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Eventually, the mantis abandons hope and, even when free to drag himself away, lies there motionless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I lift him lightly in my mouth and spit him out again.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since, even then, he just lies loafing on the ground, I prod him with my paw.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Under that stimulus the mantis hauls himself erect and makes a kind of clumsy leap for freedom.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So once again, down comes my quick immobilizing paw.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the end, bored by the repetitions, I conclude my exercise by eating him.Incidentally, for the benefit of those who’ve never munched mantis, I would report that the taste is rather unpleasant and I have been led to understand that the nutrimental value is negligible.Next to mantis hunting, my favorite sport is cricketing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In exactly the same way as, among the varieties of man, one can find oily creatures, cheeky chaps, and chatterboxes, so among the species of cicada there are oily cicadas, pert cicadas, and chatterboxes, too.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The oily ones are not much fun, being in fact too greasily importunate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The cheeky chaps annoy one, being a sight too uppity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And I am consequently most interested in silencing the chatterboxes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They do not appear until the end of summer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There comes a day when, unexpectedly, the first cool wind of autumn blows through the gaps torn in the sleeves of one’s kimono, making one feel a sniffling cold is surely on its way.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just about then the chatterboxes, tails cocked up behind them, start their singing din.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And a deal of din they make.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So much noise, in fact, one could almost believe they have no purposes in life except to chatter at the top of their rowdy voices and to be caught by cats.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is in early autumn that I catch them, and cricketing is what I call this form of taking exercise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I must first emphasize that in hunting for live chatterboxes there’s no point in quest-ing on the ground.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Any that are on the ground will invariably be found half-buried under ants.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Those which I stalk are not the perished relics at the mercy of the pismires, but those alive and chattering away in the branches of tall trees.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whilst I am on this general subject, it occurs to me to query whether these noisy creatures are shouting o-shi-i-tsuku-tsuku or tsuku-tsuku-o-shi-i.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I suspect there could be real significance in the difference, a difference no doubt capable of casting much-needed light on the whole field of cicada studies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is a topic that cries out for the exercise of the particular gifts of humankind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, man’s natural proclivity for this kind of investigation is the sole characteristic by which he is superior to a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which is, of course, precisely the reason that human beings, proud of their singularity, attach so much importance to such pettifogging points.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, if men can’t offer an immediate answer, I suggest that for all our sakes they think the matter over very carefully.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, so far as my cricketing is concerned, the outcome of their ponderings, whatever that may be, could hardly matter less.Now, with respect to the practice of cricketing, all I have to do is to climb toward the source of noise and catch the so-called singer while he is totally absorbed in his so-called act of singing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Superficially the simplest of all exercises, it is in fact quite difficult.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since I have four legs, I do not regard myself as inferior to any other animal in the matter of moving about on the surface of this planet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, by mathematical deduction of comparative mobility by reference to the number of legs involved, the average cat would seem to be at least twice as nimble as the average man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when it comes to climbing trees, there are many animals more dexterous than the cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Apart from monkeys, those absolute professionals, one is bound to concede that men, descended as they are from tree-conditioned apes, sometimes display a truly formidable skill at climbing trees.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I hasten to add that, since climbing trees is unnatural, being a direct defiance of the laws of gravity, I cannot consider a failure to shine in such unreasonable activity as in any way shameful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But it is a disadvantage to a cricketer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Luckily, I happen to possess this useful set of claws which makes it possible for me, however clumsily, to get up trees, but it’s not as easy as you might think.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s more, a chatterbox, unlike the pitiable mantis, really can fly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And once it takes to the wing, all my painful climbing profits me nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Indeed a dismal outcome.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It has, moreover, the dangerous and ugly habit of pissing in one’s eye.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One can’t complain of its taking flight, but such filthy micturition is hardly playing the game.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What psychological pressure induces this incontinence at the moment immediately prior to an act of aviation?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is it, perhaps, that the thought of flying is too unbearable to bear?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Or is it simply that a pissed-on prowler is so shockedly surprised that his intended prey gains ample time to escape?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If that latter hypothesis is correct, this urinating insect falls into a common category with the ink-ejecting squid, with the tattoo-flashing brawler in the alleyways of Tokyo, and with my poor old idiot master spouting clouds of protective Latin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Again, I would stress that this question of urination at take-off is no mere piddling matter, but an issue of possibly fundamental relevance to the study of cicadas.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The problem certainly merits the detailed study of a doctoral dissertation.But I digress too far.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Let us return to the practicalities of cricketing.The spot where the cicadas most thickly concentrate (if you object to my use in this context of the word “concentrate,” then I was originally prepared to substitute the word “assemble,” but I find that latter word so banal that I have decided to stick to “concentrate”) is the green paulownia, the so-called Sultan’s Parasol which, I am reliably informed, is known to the Chinese as the Chinese Parasol.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, the green paulownia is densely foliaged and each of its leaves is as big as a big, round fan.It is consequently hard to see the branches where my quarry lurks; a fact which constitutes another hazard for the keen cricketer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I sometimes think that it was with my predicament in mind that the author of that popular song wrote those words of yearning for “one, though heard, invisible.” In any event, the best I can do is to work my way toward that place from which the song appears to emanate.About six feet up from the ground, the trunks of all green paulownias fork conveniently into two.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Within that crotch I rest from the exer-tion of my initial climb and, peering upward between the backs of the leaves, try to see where the chatterboxes are.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sometimes, however, before I even get to the crotch, one or two of my potential victims grow alarmed and, with a curious rustling sound, impatiently take flight.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then I’ve really had it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For, judging them by their readiness to be led, and their mindless passion for conformity of conduct, these chatterboxes are no less imbecile than men.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As soon as the first one flies away, all the others follow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There are occasions, therefore, when by the time I’ve reached the fork, the whole tree stands deserted in a dead dispiriting silence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On one such day I’d climbed up to the fork only to find, however hard I peered and however much I pricked my ears, no faintest sign or sound of a chatterbox.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Deciding it would be too much of a bore to start all over again in some other tree, I concluded that the sensible thing would be to stay where I was, enjoy the relaxation and wait for a second chance when the refugees returned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Before long I grew sleepy, and soon was happily far away in the pleasant land of Nod.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My awakening was unpleasant, for I’d fallen thuddingly down onto a flagstone in the garden.Nevertheless, I usually manage to catch one chatterbox for every tree I climb.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, alas, an unavoidable characteristic of this sport, one which sadly reduces my interest in it, that, so long as I’m up in the tree, I have to hold my captive in my mouth; for, by the time I’ve descended and can spit him out on the ground, he is usually dead.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However hard I may thereafter play with him and scratch him, he offers no response.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The most exquisite moment in cricketing occurs when, after sneaking quietly upon a chatterbox whose whole vibrating being is concentrated upon song, upon the soul-absorbing business of scraping his tail parts in and out of the main shell of his body, suddenly I pounce and my paws clamp down upon him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How piercingly he shrieks, with what a threshing ecstasy of terror he shakes his thin transparent wings in efforts to escape.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The sheer speed and intensity of these happenings creates an aesthetic experience impossible to describe.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One can only say that the magnificence of its death-throes is the supreme achievement of a cicada’s life.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every time I catch a chatterbox I ask, in suitably pressing terms, for a demonstration of his thrilling artistry.When tired of his performance, I beg his pardon for the interruption and pop him into my mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Occasional virtuosi have been known to continue with their act even after my mouth has closed behind them.After cricketing, my next most favored form of physical exercise is pine sliding.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A detailed explanation would be too much, so I’ll offer only the minimum of comment needed for an understanding of this sport.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Its name suggests that it is sliding down pine trees, but, in fact, it doesn’t.It is, indeed, another form of climbing trees.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But whereas when cricketing I climb to catch a chatterbox, when pine sliding I climb purely for the climbing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ever since Genzaemon warmed the room for laypriest Saimyoji, that one-time Regent at Kamakura, by burning those trees to which Genzaemon in his own happier days had been particularly attached, the pine tree has been not only, as the song about that incident assures us, naturally an evergreen, but also most unnaturally rough-barked to one’s touch.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whatever the explanation, there is certainly no tree less slippery than the pine, and no trunk in the world affords a better climbing surface either for hands or for feet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Clearly, when it comes to claws, nothing is more clawable and I can consequently run up a pine trunk in one breath.Having run up, I run down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now there are two styles of downward running.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One way is to descend, effectively upside-down, with one’s head facing the ground; the other is to descend tail-first in the normal attitude for an ascending climb.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And which, I would ask you know-it-all human beings, would you suppose is the more difficult style of the two?Being but shallow brained, you probably think that one would find it easier to position one’s head so as to lead in the direction of desired movement; you’d be wrong.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When you heard me speak of running downward, no doubt you thought immediately of Yoshitsune’s headlong horse charge down the cliff at Hiyodori-goe.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And I can imagine you thinking to yourself that anything good enough for a human hero like Yoshitsune must be more than sufficient for some unnamed, unknown cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But such disdain would be entirely misplaced.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just to begin with, do you know how cats’ claws grow, their directional positioning in accordance with their function?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They are, in fact, retrorsely curved so that, like firemen’s hooks, they are peculiarly suited to catching hold of things and drawing them chestward.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They are virtually useless for pushing things away.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, since I am a terrestrial creature, it would be a breach of natural law if, having dashed up a pine tree trunk, I were to remain indefinitely and unsupported at the swaying top of the tree.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I would certainly fall down.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And, if that fall were nowise checked, the rate of my descent could well prove lethal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, when I take measures to mitigate the potentially disastrous effects of the laws of gravity and nature, I call the consequent process of descent “descending.”Though there may seem to be a substantial difference between descending and free falling, it isn’t as great as one might fondly imagine; indeed, no more than a single letter’s worth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since I do not care to free all out of a pine tree top, I must find some means to check the natural acceleration of my body.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And that’s where my claws come in; or rather, out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being retrorsely curved, all my twenty claws, appropriately extended from my heaven-facing body, provide a gripping power and frictional resistance sufficient to transform the hazards of free fall into the relative safety of descent.Simple, isn’t it?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But you just try to come down from a pine tree like a wolf on the fold in the headlong Yoshitsune style, and that’s not simple at all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Claws are useless.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nothing retards the slithering acceleration of your body’s weight, and those who’d hoped thus safely to descend, finish up by plummeting earthward like boulders dropped by rocs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You will, accordingly, appreciate that the headlong descent of Hiyodori-goe was an exceptionally difficult feat, one which only a veritable hero could successfully accomplish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Among cats, probably only I, the Yoshitsune of my kind, can pull it off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I accordingly feel I have earned my right to give a name to this particular sport, and I have chosen “pine sliding.”I cannot conclude these few words on the subject of sport without at least some mention of “going around the fence.” My master’s garden, rectangular in shape, is on all sides separated from neighboring properties by a bamboo fence about three feet high.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The section running parallel to the veranda is some fifty feet long, and the two side-sections are each about half that length.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The object of the aforementioned sport is to walk right around the whole property without falling off the thin top edge of the fence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There are times, I confess, when I do topple off, but, when successful, I find such tours of the horizon eminently gratifying.Really, great fun.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The fence is supported here and there, and particularly at the corners, by sturdy cedar stakes, fire hardened at each end, on the tops of which I can conveniently take breathers in the course of my circumambulation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I found myself today in really rather good form.Before lunch I managed three successful tours, and on each occasion my performance improved.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Naturally, every improvement adds to the fun.I was just about halfway home on my fourth time around when three crows, gliding down from the next-door roof, settled on the fence-top, side-by- side, some six short feet ahead of me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Cheeky bastards!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quite apart from the fact that they’re interrupting my exercise, such low-born, ill-bred, rain-guttersnipes have no right whatsoever to come trespassing, indeed seemingly to start squatting, on my fence-property.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So I told them, in terms of hissing clarity, to get lost.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The nearest crow, turning its head toward me, appears to be grinning like a half-wit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The next one unconcernedly studies my master’s garden.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And the third continues wiping his filthy beak on a projecting splinter of the fence bamboo.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He had all too evidently just finished eating something rather nasty.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I stood there balanced on the fence, giving them a civilized three minutes grace to shove off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve heard that these birds are commonly called Crowmagnons, and they certainly look as daft and primitively barbarous as their uncouth nickname would suggest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Despite my courteous waiting, they neither greeted me nor flew away.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Becoming at last inpatient, I began slowly to advance; whereupon the nearest Crowmagnon tentatively stirred his wings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I thought he was at last backing off in face of my power, but all he did was to shift his posture so as to present his arse, rather than his head, toward me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Outright insolence!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Conduct unbecoming even a Crow-magnon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Were we on the ground, I would call him to immediate account, but, alas, being as I am engaged upon a passage both strenuous and perilous, I really can’t be bothered to be diverted from my purpose by such aboriginal naiseries.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the other hand, I do not greatly care for the idea of being stuck here while a trey of brainless birds waits for whatever impulse will lift them into the air.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For one thing, there’s my poor tired feet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Those feathered lightweights are used to standing around in such precarious places so that, if my fence-top happens to please them, they might perch here forever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I, on the other hand, am already exhausted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This is my fourth time around today, and this particular exercise is anyway no less tricky than tightrope-walking.At the best of times, each teetering step I take could throw me clean off-balance, which makes it all the more unpardonable that these three blackamoors should loaf here blocking the way.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If it comes to the worst, I shall just have to abandon today’s exercises and hop down from the fence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s a bore, of course, but perhaps I might as well hop down now.After all, I am heavily outnumbered by the enemy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Besides, the poor simple things do seem to be strangers in these parts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Their beaks, I notice, are almost affectedly pointed, the sort of savage, stabbing snout that, found amongst his sons, would make its foul possessor the most sharply favored member of a long-nosed goblin’s brood.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The signs are unmistakable that these Crow-magnon louts will be equally ill-natured.If I start a fight and then, by sheer mischance, happen to lose my foot-ing, the loss of face will be much greater than if I just chose to disengage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, thinking that it might be prudent to avoid a showdown, I had just decided to hop down when the arse-presenting savage offered me a rudery.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Arseholes,” he observed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His immediate neighbor repeated this coarse remark, while the last one of the trio took the trouble to say it twice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I simply could not overlook behavior so offensive.First and foremost, to allow myself to be grossly insulted in my own garden by these mere crows would reflect adversely upon my good name.Should you object that I do not have a name to be reflected upon, I will amend that sentence to refer to reflections upon my honor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When my honor is involved, cost what it may, I cannot retreat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At this point it occurred to me that a disorderly rabble is often described as a “flock of crows;” so it is just possible that, though they outnumber me three to one, when it comes to the crunch they’ll prove more weak than they look.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus comforted, thus grimly resolute, I began slowly to advance.The crows, oblivious to my action, seem to be talking among themselves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They are exasperating!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If only the fence were wider by five or six inches, I’d really give them hell.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But as things are, however vehemently vexed I may feel, I can only tiptoe slowly forward to avenge my injured honor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Eventually, I reached a point a bare half-foot away from the nearest bird and was urging myself onward to one last final effort when, all together and as though by prearrangement, the three brutes suddenly flapped their wings and lumbered up to hang a couple of feet above me in the air.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The down-draught gusted into my face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unsportingly surprised, I lost my balance and fell off sideways into the garden.Kicking myself for permitting such a shameful mishap to occur, I looked up from the ground to find all three marauders safely landed back again where they had perched before.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Their three sharp beaks in parallel alignment, they peer down superciliously into my angry eyes.The bloody nerve of them!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I responded with a glowering scowl.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which left them quite unmoved.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So next I snarled and arched my back.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Equally ineffective.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as the subtlety of symbolic poetry is lost on a material-ist, so were the symbols of my anger quite meaningless to the crows.Which, now that I reflect upon the matter, is perfectly understandable.Hitherto, and wrongly, I have been seeking to cope with crows as if they had been cats.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Had that been the case, they would by now, most certainly, have reacted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But crows are crows, and what but crow behavior can anyone expect of them?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My efforts have, in fact, all been as pointless as the increasingly short-tempered arguments of a businessman trying to budge my master; as pointless as Yoritomo’s gift of a solid silver cat to the unworldly Saigyo; as pointless as the bird shit that these fools and their fool cousins fly over to Ueno to deposit on the statue of poor Sai-o Takamori.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Once I have conceived a thought, I waste no time before I act upon it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It were better to give up than to persist in a dialogue with dunces, so I abandoned my endeavors and withdrew to the veranda.It was time for dinner anyway.Exercise has merits, but one mustn’t overdo it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My whole body felt limp and almost slovenly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What’s more I feel horribly hot.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We are now at the beginning of autumn, and during my exercise my fur seems to have become saturated with afternoon sunshine.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The sweat which oozes from the pores in my skin refuses to drop away, but clings in greasy clots around the roots of every separate hair.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My back itches.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One can clearly distinguish between itches caused by perspiration and itches caused by creeping fleas.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If the site of the itch lies within reach of my mouth, I can bite the cause, and if within reach of my feet, I know precisely how to scratch it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if the irritation is at the midpoint of my spine, I simply can’t get at it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In such a case, one must either frot oneself on the first available human being or scrape one’s back against a pine tree’s bark.Since men are both vain and stupid, I approach them in a suitably ingratiating manner using, as they would say, “tones that would wheedle a cat.” Such are the tones men sometimes use to me, but, seen from my position, the phrase should be “tones by which a cat may be wheedled.”Not that it matters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, human beings being the nitwits that they are, a purring approach to any of them, either male or female, is usually interpreted as proof that I love them, and they consequently let me do as I like, and on occasions, poor dumb creatures, they even stroke my head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of late, however, just because some kind of parasitic insect, fleas, in fact, have taken to breeding in my fur, even my most tentative approaches to a human being evoke a gross response.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am grabbed by the scruff of the neck and pitched clean out of the room.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It seems that this sudden aversion stems from human disgust with those barely visible and totally insignificant insects which I harbor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A heartless and most callous attitude!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How can such inconsiderate behavior possibly be justified by the presence in my coat of one or two thousand footling fleas?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The answer is, of course, that Article One of those Laws of Love (by which all human creatures regulate their lives) specifically enjoins that “ye shall love one another for so long as it serves thine individual interest.”Now that the human attitude towards me has so completely changed, I cannot exploit manpower to ease my itching, however virulent it may become.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I therefore have no choice but to resort to the alternative method of finding relief in scraping myself on pine bark.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
To that end I was just going down the veranda steps when I realized that even this alternative solution was a silly idea and would not work.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The point is that pines secrete an extremely sticky resin which, once it has gummed the ends of my fur together, cannot be loosened even if struck by lightning, or fired upon by the whole Russian Baltic Fleet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s more, as soon as five hairs stick together, then ten, then thirty hairs get inextri-cably stuck.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am a dainty cat of candid temperament, and any creature as clinging, poisonous, and vindictive as this tenacious resin is an anath-ema to me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I cannot stand persons of that kind, and even if one such particular person were the most beautiful cat in the world, let alone a creature loathsome as resin, still I’d be revolted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is outrageous that my charmingly pale gray coat can be ruined by a substance whose social and evolutionary status is no higher than that of the gummy muck which streams in the cold north wind from the corners of Rickshaw Blacky’s eyes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Resin ought to realize the impropriety of its nature, but will, of course, do no such thing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, the very moment my back makes contact with a pine tree, great clots of resin gather on my fur.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To have anything to do with so insensitive, so inconsiderate a creature would not only be beneath my personal dignity, but would be a defilement to anyone in my coat and lineage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I conclude that, however fleasome I may feel, I have no choice but to grin and bear it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nonetheless, it is extremely disheartening to find that the two standard means of alleviating my discomfort are both unavailable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unless I can quickly find some other solution, the irritation in my skin, and the thought of gumminess in my mind, will bring me to a nervous breakdown.Sinking down upon my hind-legs into a thinking posture, I had scarcely begun my search for bright ideas when an illuminating memory flashed upon me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Every so often my scruffy master saunters off out of the house with a cake of soap and a hand towel.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he returns some thirty or forty minutes later, his normally dull complexion, while not exactly glowing, has nevertheless acquired a certain modest liveliness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If such expeditions can confer a sheen of vitality upon that shabby sloven, what wonders they might work upon myself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, of course, true that I am already so extremely handsome that improvements, if possible, are hardly necessary, but if by some misfortune I were to fall sick and perish at this very tender age of one year and a few odd months, I could never forgive myself for allowing so irremediable a loss to be inflicted upon the populace of the world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I believe that the object of my master’s sorties is one of those devices invented by mankind as a means of easing the tedium of its existence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Inasmuch as the public bath is an invention of mankind, it can hardly be much use to anyone but, clutching as I am at straws, I might as well investigate the matter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If it’s as pointless as I anticipate, nothing would be simpler than to drop my enquiries; but I remain unsure whether human beings are sufficiently broadminded to give a cat, a member of another species, even a chance to investigate the efficacy of an institution devised for human purposes.I cannot imagine that I could be refused entry when nobody dreams of questioning the casual comings and goings of my master, but it would be socially most embarrassing to find myself turned from the door.Prudence suggests the wisdom of reconnaissance and, if I like the look of the place, then I can hop in with a hand towel in my mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My plan of action formed, I set off for the public bath at a properly leisurely pace.As one turns left around the corner from our side street, one may observe a little further up the road an object like an upended bamboo waterpipe puffing thin smoke-fumes straight up into the sky.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That fum-ing finger marks the site of the public bathhouse.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I stole in through its back entrance.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That style of entry is usually looked down upon as mean-spirited or cowardly, but such criticisms are merely the tedious grumbles spiced with jealousy which one must expect from persons only capable of gaining access by front doors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is abundantly clear from the records of history that persons of high intelligence invariably launch attacks both suddenly and from the rear.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Furthermore, I note from my study of The Making of a Gentleman (volume two, chapter one, pages five and six) that a backdoor, like a gentleman’s last will and testament, provides the means whereby an individual establishes his true moral excellence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being a truly twentieth-century cat, I have had included in my education, more than sufficient of such weighty learning, to make it inappropriate for anyone to sneer at my selected mode of entry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, once I was inside, I found on my immediate left a positive mountain of pine logs cut into eight-inch lengths and, next to it, a heaped-up hill of coal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Some of my readers may wonder what the subtle significance of my careful distinction between a mountain of logs and a mere hill of coal is.There is, in fact, no subtle significance whatsoever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I simply used the two words, “hill” and “mountain,” as they should correctly be used.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Far from having time to think about literary niceties, I am overwhelmed with pity for the human race which, having regularly dieted on such revolting objects as rice, birds, fish, and even animals, is now apparently reduced to munching lumps of coal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Right in front of me I see an open entrance about six feet wide.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I peep through and find everything dead quiet but, from somewhere beyond, there comes a lively buzz of human voices and I deduce that the bath must be where the sound originates.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I move forward between the woodpile and the coal heap, turn left and find a glazed window to my right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the ledge below, a considerable number of small round tubs is piled up into a pyramid.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My heart goes out to them, for it must be painfully contrary to a round thing’s concept of reality to be constricted within a triangular world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To the south of these piles the sill juts out for a few feet with, as if to welcome me, wooden boarding on it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since the board is roughly three feet up from the ground, it is, from my point of view, at an ideal hopping height.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“All right,” I said to myself, and, as I flew up nimbly to the board, the public bath, like something dangled, suddenly appeared beneath my very nose.There is nothing in the world more pleasant than to eat something one has never yet eaten, or to see something one has never seen before.If my readers, like my master, spend thirty or forty minutes on three days of every passing week in the world of the public bath, then of course that world can offer them few surprises: but if, like me, they have never seen that spectacle, they should make immediate arrangements to do so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Don’t worry about the deathbed of your parents, but at all costs do not miss the grand show of the public bath.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The world is wide, but in my opinion it has no sight more startlingly remarkable to offer.Wherein, you ask, resides its crass spectacularity?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, it is so variously spectacular that I hesitate to particularize.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First of all, the human beings vociferously swarming about beyond the window-glass are all stark naked.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
As totally unclothed as Formosan aborigines.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Primeval Adams still prancing about in this twentieth century.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am moved by so much nudity to preface my comments with a history of clothing, but it would take so long that I will spare my readers any rehash of the learned observations of Herr Doktor Diogenes Teufelsdrockh in his monumental study on this subject ( Die Kleider, Werden und Wizken) and simply refer them to a slightly less learned commentary on that work, Mr. Thomas Carlyle’s Sartor Resartus.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The essential fact remains that the clothes are the man, that the ungarbed man is nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Skipping centuries of sartorial civilization, indeed a tautological phrase, I would remind my readers that Beau Nash, in the heyday of his social regulation of eighteenth-century Bath, a royally patronized hotsprings spa in the west of England, established the inflexible rule that men and women submerging themselves in those salutary waters should, nevertheless, be clothed from their shoulders down to their feet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A further relevant incident occurred, again in a certain English city, just after the mid-point of the nineteenth century.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It so happened that this city then founded a School of Art and, quite naturally, the school’s function involved the presence and display of various studies, drawings, paintings, models, and statues of the naked human figure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the inauguration of this school placed both its own staff and the city fathers in a deeply embarrassing situation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There could be no question but that the leading ladies of the city must be invited to the opening ceremony.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unfortunately, all civilized females of that era were unshakably sure that human beings are clothes-animals having no relationship whatsoever, let alone blood-kinship, with the skin-clad apes.A man without his clothes, they knew it for a fact, was like an elephant shorn of its trunk, a school without its students, soldiers devoid of courage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyone without the other of these pairs would be so totally decharacterized as to become, if not a complete nonentity, at least an entity of a basely tran-substantiated nature, and a man so transubstanti-ated would be, at best, a beast.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The ladies, as the saying is, laid it on the line.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“For us to consort with such beast-humans, even though those bestialities were only present in the form of drawings and statues, would compromise our honor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If they are to be present at the ceremony, we will not attend.”The school authorities thought the ladies were all being a little silly but, in the West as in the East, women, however physically unfit for the hard slog of pounding rice or of slashing about on the battlefield, are indispensably ornamental features of any opening ceremony.What, then, could be done?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The school authorities took themselves off to a draper’s shop, bought thirty-five and seven-eighths rolls of suitable black material and clothed their beastly prints, their less-than-human statues, in a hundred yards of humanizing huckaback.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Lest any lady’s modesty might be outraged accidentally, they even masked the faces of their statues in swathes of sable stuffs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"European marble and Hellenic plaster thus yashmaked out of the animal kingdom, I am happy to record that the ceremony went off to the complete satisfaction of all concerned.From those remarkable accounts the importance of clothes to mankind may be deduced.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, very recently, there has been a swing in the opposite direction and people may now be found who go about incessantly advocating nudity, praising nude pictures and generally making a naked menace of themselves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I think they are in error.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, since I have remained decently clothed from the moment of my birth, how could I think otherwise?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The craze for the nude began when, at the Renaissance, the traditional customs of the ancient Greeks and Romans were repopularized, for their own lewd ends, by the Italianate promot-ers of that cultural rebirth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The ancient Greeks and Romans were culturally accustomed to nudity, and it is highly unlikely that they recognized any connection between nakedness and public morality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But in northern Europe the prevailing climate is cold.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even in Japan there is a saying that “one cannot travel naked,” so that, by natural law, in Germany or England, a naked man is very soon a dead one.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since dying is daft, northerners wear clothes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And when everyone wears clothes, human beings become clothes-animals.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And having once become clothes-animals, they are unable to conceive that any naked animal whom they may happen to run across could possibly also be human.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Its absence of clobber immediately identifies its brutish nature.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, it is understandable that Europeans, especially northern Europeans, might regard nude pictures and nude statues as essentially bestial.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In other words, Europeans and Japanese have the good sense to recognize nudes and representations of nudity as life-forms inferior to cats.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But nudes are beautiful, you say?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What of it?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Beasts, though beautiful, are beasts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Some of my more knowledgeable readers, seeking to catch me in an inconsistency, may possibly ask whether I’ve ever seen a European lady in evening dress?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Inevitably, being only a cat, I’ve never had that honor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I am reliably advised that Western ladies in formal evening wear do in fact expose their shoulders, arms, and even breasts, which is, of course, disgusting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Before Renaissance times, women’s dress styles did not sink to such scandalous levels, to such ridiculous decolletages.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Instead, at all times women wore the clothes one would normally expect on any human being.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why, then, have they transformed themselves to look like vulgar acrobats?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would be far too wearisome to set down all the dreary history of that decadence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Let it suffice that those who know the reasons, know them, and that those who don’t, don’t need to.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, whatever the historical background, the fact remains that modern women, each and every night, trick themselves out in virtual undress and evince the deepest self-satisfaction with their bizarre appearances.However, it would seem that somewhere under that beastly brazenness, they retain some spark of human feeling, because, as soon as the sun comes up, they cover their shoulders, sleeve their arms, and tuck away their breasts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is all the more odd in that, not only do they sheathe themselves by day to the point of near invisibility, but they carry their lunacy to the extreme of considering it extremely disgraceful to expose so much as a single day-lit toenail to the public view.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such inane contra-riety surely proves that women’s evening dresses are the brainchild of some gibbering conference of brain-damaged freaks.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If women resent that logic, why don’t they try walking about in the daytime with bared shoulders, arms, and breasts?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The same type of enquiry should also be addressed to nudists.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If they are so besotted with the nude, why don’t they strip their daughters?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And why, while they’re about it, don’t they and their families stroll around Ueno Park in no more than that nakedness they so affect to love?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It can’t be done, they say?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But of course it can.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The only reason why they hesitate is not, I bet, because it can’t be done, but simply because Europeans don’t do it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The proof of my point is in their dusk behavior.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There they are, swaggering down to the lmpe-rial Hotel, all dolled-up in those crazy evening dresses.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What origin and history do such cockeyed costumes have?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nothing indigenous.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Our bird-brained ladies flaunt themselves in goose-skinned flesh and feathers solely because that is the mode in Europe.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Europeans are powerful, so it matters not how ridiculous or daft their goings on, everyone must imitate even their daftest designs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yield to the long, and be trimmed down; yield to the powerful, and be humbled; yield to the weighty, and be squashed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Prudence demands a due degree of yielding, but surely only dullards yield all along the line, surely only chimpanzees ape everything they see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If my readers answer that they can’t help being dullards, can’t help being born without ability to discriminate in imitation, then of course I pardon them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But in that case, they must abandon all pretense that the Japanese are a great nation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I might add that all my foregoing comments apply with equal force in the field of academic studies, but, since I am here only concerned with questions of clothing, I will not now press the scholastic parallels.I think I have established the importance of their clothes to human beings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, their clothing is so demonstrably all-important to them that one may reasonably wonder whether human beings are clothes, or clothes are the current acme of the evolutionary process.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am tempted to suggest that human history is not the history of flesh and bone and blood, but a mere chronicle of costumes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Things have indeed come to a pretty pass when a naked man is seen, not as a man, but as a monster.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If by mutual agreement all men were to become monsters, obviously none would see anything monstrous in the others.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which would be a happy situation, were it not that men would be unhappy with it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When mankind first appeared upon the earth, a benign nature manufactured them to standard specifications, and all, equally naked, were pitched forth into the world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Had mankind been created with an inborn readiness to be content with equality, I cannot see why, born naked, they should have been discontent to live and die unclothed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, one of these primeval nudists seems to have communed with himself along the following lines.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Since I and all my fellowman are indistinguishably alike, what is the point of effort?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However hard I strive, I cannot of myself climb beyond the common rut.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, since I yearn to be conspicuous, I think I’ll drape myself in something that will draw the eyes and blow the minds of all these clones around me.” I would guess that he thought and thought for at least ten years before he came up with a stupendous idea, that glory of man’s inventiveness, pants.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He put them on at once and, puffed up with pride and all primordial pompousness, paraded about among his startled fellows.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
From him descend today’s quaintclouted rickshawmen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It seems a little strange to have taken ten long years to think up something as simple, and as brief, as shorts, but the strangeness is only a kind of optical illusion created by time’s immensely long perspective.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the days of man’s remote antiquity, no such breathtaking invention as pants had ever been achieved.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve heard that it took Descartes, no intellectual slouch, a full ten years to arrive at his famous conclusion, obvious surely to any three-year-old, that I think and therefore I am.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since original thought is thus demonstrably difficult, perhaps one should concede that it was an intellectual feat, even if it took ten years, for the wits of proto-rickshawman to formulate the notion of knickers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, ennobled by their knickers, the breed of rickshawmen became lords of creation and stalked the highways of the world with such overweening pride that some of the more spirited among the cloutless monsters were provoked into competition.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Judging by its uselessness, I would guess that they spent a mere six years in planning their particular invention, the good-for-nothing surcoat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The knickers’ glory faded and the golden age of surcoats shone upon the world, and from those innovators are descended all the green-grocers, chemists, drapers, and haberdashers of today.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When twilight fell, first upon knickers and then upon surcoats, there came the dawn of Japanese skirted-trousers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"These were designed by monsters peeved by the surcoat boom, and the descendants of their inventors include both the warriors of medieval times and all contemporary government officials.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The plain, if regrettable, fact is that all the originally naked monsters strove vaingloriously to outdo each other in the novelty and weirdness of their gear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The ultimate grotesquerie has only recently appeared in swallow-tailed jackets.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet if one ponders the history of these quaint manifestations, one recognizes that there is nothing random in their occurrence.The development was neither haphazard nor aimless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the contrary, it is man’s deathless eagerness to compete, the driving stretch of his intrepid spirit, his resolute determination to outdo all other members of his species, which has guided the production of successive styles of clothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A member of this species does not go around shouting aloud that he or she differs in himself (or herself) from others of the species: instead each one goes about wearing different clothes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From this observed behavior a major psychological truth about this race of forked destroyers may be deduced: that, just as nature abhors a vacuum,“mankind abhors equality.” Being thus psychologically determined, they now have no choice whatsoever but to continue enveloping themselves in clothes and would regard a deprivation thereof with as much alarm as they would face a cutting off of flesh or the removal of a bone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To them it would be absolute madness to cast their various clouts, a ripping away of their essential human substance, and as unthinkable to attempt a return to their original condition of equality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even if they could bear the shame of being accounted lunatics, it would not be feasible to return to a state of nature in which, by all civilized standards, they would automatically become not merely lunatics but monsters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even if all the billions of human inhabitants of this globe could be rehabilitated as monsters, even if they were purged of their shame by total reassurance that, since all were monsters, none were monsters, believe you me, it still would do no good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The very next day after the reign of equality among monsters had been re-established, the monsters would be at it once again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If they can’t compete with their clothes on, then they will compete as monsters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With every man-jack stark-staring naked, they would begin to differentiate between degrees of staring starkness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For which reason alone, it would, I think, be best if clothes were not abandoned.It is consequently incredible that the assorted human creatures now displayed before my very eyes should have taken off their clothes.Surcoats, skirted trousers, even their smallest smalls, things from which their owners would as soon be parted as from their guts and bladders, are all stacked up on shelves while the recreated monsters are, with complete composure, even chatting, scandalously exposing their archetypal nudity to the public view.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Are you surprised then, gentle readers, that some time back I described this scene as genuinely spectacular?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Shocked as I was, and am, it will be my honor to record for the benefit of all truly civilized gentlemen as much as I can of this extraordinary sight.I must start by confessing that, faced by such mind-boggling chaos, I don’t know how to start describing it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The monsters show no method in their madness, and it consequently is difficult to systematize analysis thereof.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, I can’t be sure that it actually is a bath, but I make the wild surmise that it can’t be anything else.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is about three feet wide and nine feet long, and is divided by an upright board into two sections.One section contains white-colored bathwater.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I understand that this is what they call a medicated bath: it has a turbid look, as though lime had been dissolved in it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Actually, it looks not only turbid with lime, but also heavily charged and scummed with grease.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s hardly a wonder that it looks so whitely stale, for I’m told that the water is changed but once a week.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The other section comprises the ordinary bath, but, here again, by no stretch of the imagination could its water be described as crystal clear or pellucid.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It has the peculiarly repulsive color of stirred rainwater which, against the danger of fire, has stood for months in a rain tank on a public street.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Next, though the effort kills me, I will describe the monsters themselves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I see two youngsters standing beside that tank of dirty water.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They stand facing each other and are pouring pail after pail of hot water over each other’s bellies.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which certainly seems a worthwhile occupation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The two men are faultlessly developed, so far as the sun-burnt blackness of their skin is concerned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I watch them, thinking that these monsters have remarkably sturdy figures, one of them, pawing at his chest with a hand towel, suddenly speaks to the other.“Kin, old man, I’ve got a pain right here.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wonder what it is.”“That’s your stomach.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Stomach pains can kill you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’d better watch it carefully,” is Kin’s most earnest advice.“But it’s here, on my left,” says the first one, pointing at his left lung.“Sure, that there’s your stomach.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the left, the stomach, and on the right, the lung.”“Really?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I thought the stomach was about here,” and this time he taps himself lightly on the hip.“Don’t be silly, that’s the lumbago,” Kin mockingly replies.At this point, a man of about twenty-five or twenty-six and sporting a thin moustache jumped into the bath with a plop.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Next minute, the soap and loosened dirt upon his body rose to the surface, and the water glinted richly as if it might be mined for mineral wealth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Right beside him a bald-headed old man is talking to some close-cropped crony.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only their heads are visible above the water.“Nothing’s much fun anymore when you get to be old like me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Once one gets decrepit, one can’t keep up with the youngsters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when it comes to a hot bath, even though they say that only lads can take real heat, that, for me, must still be really hot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Otherwise,” the old man boastfully observed, “I don’t feel right.”“But you, sir, are in spanking health.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not bad at all to be as energetic as you are.”“I’m not all that energetic, you know.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I only manage to keep free from illness.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A man, they say, should live to be a hundred and twenty provided he does nothing bad.”“What!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Does one live as long as that?”“Of course.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I guarantee it up to a hundred and twenty.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the days before the Restoration there was a family called Magaribuchi-they were personal retainers of the Shogun—they used to live up here in Tokyo at Ushigome—and one of their male servants lived to a hundred and thirty.”“That’s a remarkable age.”“Yes, indeed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He was in fact so old that he’d clean forgotten his age.He told me he could remember it until he turned a hundred, but then he just lost count.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, when I knew him he was a hundred and thirty and still going strong.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I don’t know what’s become of him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For all I know, he may be out there still, still alive and kicking.” So saying, he emerged from the bath.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His whiskered friend remained in the water, grinning to himself and scattering all around him suds that glittered like small flecks of mica.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The man who thereupon got into the bath was certainly no ordinary monster; for all across his back was spread a vast tattoo.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It seemed to represent that legendary hero, lwami Jutaro-, about to decapitate a python with a huge high-brandished sword.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For some sad reason, the tattoo has not yet been completed and the python must be guessed at.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The great Jutaro- looks a mite discomfited.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As this illustrated man jumped into the water, “Much too tepid,” he remarked.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The man entering immediately behind him seems disposed to agree.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Oh dear,” he says, “they ought to heat it up a bit.” Just the same his features crack into a strained grimace, as though the water were in fact too hot for him.Finding himself right next to the tattooed monster, “Hello, chief,” he greets him.The tattooed monster nodded and, after a while, enquired “And how is Mr. Tami?”“Couldn’t say.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s gone so potty about gambling.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
”“Not just gambling.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
”“So?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s something wrong with that one.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s always bloody-minded.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I don’t know, but no one really likes him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can’t quite put a finger on it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Somehow one can’t quite trust him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A man with a trade just shouldn’t be like that.”“Exactly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Mr. Tami is rather too pleased with himself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Too damn stuck up, I’d say.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s why folk don’t trust him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Wouldn’t you say?”“You’re right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He thinks he’s in a class by himself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which never pays.”“All the old craftsmen around here are dying off.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The only ones left are you, Mr. Moto the cooper, the master brickmaker, and that’s about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, as you know, I too was born in these parts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But just take Mr. Tami.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nobody knows where he sprang from.”“True.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s a wonder that he’s come as far as he has.”“Indeed it is.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Somehow nobody likes him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nobody even wants to pass the time of day with such an awkward bastard.” Poor old Mr. Tami is getting it in the neck from all and sundry.Shifting my gaze away from the section filled with filthy rainwater, I now concentrate upon the section filled with limey goo.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It proves to be packed with people.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, it would be more exact to describe it as containing hot water between men rather than as containing men in its hot water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All the creatures here are, moreover, quite remarkably lethargic.For quite some time now, men have been climbing in but none has yet climbed out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One cannot wonder that the water gets fouled when so many people use it and a whole week trundles by before the water’s changed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Duly impressed by the turmoil in that tub, I peered more deeply among its tight-squeezed monsters and there I found my wretched master cowering in the left-hand corner, squashed and par-boiled poppy-red.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Poor old thing!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Someone ought to make a gap and let him scramble out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But no one seems willing to budge an inch, and indeed my master himself appears perfectly happy to stay where he is.He simply stands there motionless as his skin climbs through the gradu-ations of red to a vile vermilion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a ghastly ordeal!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I guess his readiness to suffer such dire reddening reflects a determination to extract his full two farthings worth in return for the bathhouse fee.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, devoted as I am to that dim monster of mine, I cannot sit here comfy on my ledge without worrying lest, dizzied by steam and medicating chemicals, he drown if he dallies longer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As these thoughts drifted through my mind, the fellow floating next to my master frowns and then remarks, “All the same, this is a bit too strong.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s boiling up, really scorching, from somewhere here behind me.” I deduce that, reluctant to come out with a flat complaint which might impugn his manliness, he is trying indirectly to rouse the sympathy of his boiling fellow-monsters.“Oh no, this is just about right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Any cooler, and a medicinal bath has no effect at all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Back where I come from we take them twice as hot as this.” Some braggart speaks from the depths of swirling steam.“Anyway, what the hell kind of good can these baths do?” enquires another monster who has covered his knobbly head with a neatly folded hand towel.“It’s good for all sorts of things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They say it’s good for everything.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, it’s terrific,” replies a man with a face one could mistake, as much by reason of its color as of its shape, for a haggard cucumber.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I thought to myself that if these limey waves are truly so effective, he ought to at least look a little more plump, a little more firm on the vine.“I always say that the first day, when they put the medicine in, is not the best for results.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One needs to wait until the third day, even the fourth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Today, for instance, everything’s just about right.” This knowing comment, accompanied by an equally knowing look, came from a fat-tish man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps his chubbiness is really no more than layers of dirt deposited by the water.“Would it, d’you think, be good to drink?” asks a high-pitched queru-lous voice which quavers up from somewhere unidentifiable.“If you feel a cold coming on, down a mugful just before going to bed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you do that, you won’t need to wake up in the night to go for a pee.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s quite extraordinary.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You ought to try it.” Again, I cannot tell from which of the steam-wreathed faces this wisdom bubbled out.Turning my gaze from the baths, I stare down at the duckboards on the bathhouse floor where rows of naked men are sitting and sprawling in ugly disarray.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Each adopts the posture that best suits him for scrub-bing away at whichsoever portion of his body occupies his attention.Among these seriously contorted nudists, two attract my most astonished stare.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One, flat on his back gawping up at the skylight; the other, flat on his stomach, is peering down the drainhole in the floor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Their utter self-abandonment, the totality of their idleness, is somehow deeply impressive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In another part of the forest, as Shakespeare pleasantly put it, a man with a shaven head squats down with his face to the stone of the wall while a younger, smaller man, also shaven-pated, stands behind him pounding away at his shoulders.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They seem to have some kind of master-pupil relationship, and the pupil-type is busy playing the part of an unpaid bath attendant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There is, of course, a genuine bath attendant also somewhere on the scene.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is, in fact, not giving anyone a massage but merely tilting heated water out of an oblong pail over the shoulders of a seated patron.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He looks as though he must have caught a cold because, despite the fearful hotness of the place, he’s wearing a sort of padded sleeveless vest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I notice that, by a crooking of his right big toe, his foot is gripped on a camlet rag.My glance drifts away to light upon a selfish monster hoarding no less than three wash pails for himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Oddly enough, he keeps pressing his neighbor to make use of his soap; perhaps in order to inflict upon that defenseless creature a long and slightly loony flow of talk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I strain my ears to catch the conversation, which is, in truth, a monologue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“A gun is an imported thing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Something foreign, not something Japanese.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In the good old days it was all a matter of sword against sword.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But foreigners are cowards, so they dreamt up something dastardly like guns.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They don’t come from China, though.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Long-range fighting with guns is what you’d expect from one of those Western countries.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There weren’t any guns in the days of Coxinga who, for all his Chinese name, was descended from the Emperor Seiwa through the Minamoto line.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yoshitsune, the best of the Minamotos, was not killed when they say he was.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No, indeed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Instead he fled from Hokkaido to Manchuria, taking with him a Hokkaido man especially good at giving advice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then Yoshitsune’s son, calling himself a Manchurian, attacked the Emperor of China and the Great Ming was flat flummoxed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So what did he do?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He sent a messenger to the third Tokugawa Shogun begging for the loan of three thousand soldiers.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the Shogun kept the messenger waiting in Japan for two whole years.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I can’t remember the messenger’s name, but he had some name or other.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In the end the Shogun sent him down to Nagasaki where he got mixed up with a prostitute.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She then had a son.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And that son was Coxinga.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, when the messenger at last got home to China, he found that the Emperor of the Ming had been destroyed by traitors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”I can’t make heads or tails of this amazing rigmarole.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It sounds so totally barmy, so crazed a mixture of garbled legends and historical untruths, that my attention again drifts away to focus on a gloomy looking fellow, maybe twenty-five or twenty-six years old, who appears to be steaming his crotch in the medicated water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He wears a vacant expression and seems to be suffering from a swelling or something.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The very young man of seventeen or eighteen who sits beside him, talking in an affected manner, is presumably some houseboy from the neighborhood.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Next to this mincing youth I see an odd looking back.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Each joint in its spine sticks jaggedly out as though a knotted, bamboo rod had been rammed up under the skin from somewhere down between the buttocks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On either side of the spine, perfectly aligned, are four black marks like peg holes on a piquet board.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All eight places are inflamed, some of them oozing pus.Though I’ve tried to describe each thing as it appeared before my eyes, I now realize that there’s still so much to write about that, with my limited skill, I can never set down more than a fraction of the totality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I was quietly flinching from the consequences of my own rash undertak-ing to describe in every detail the more spectacular features of a bathhouse when a bald-skulled oldster, maybe seventy years old and dressed in a light-blue, cotton kimono, suddenly appeared at the entrance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This hairless apparition bowed reverentially to his drove of naked monsters and then addressed them with the greatest fluency.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Good sirs,” he says,“I thank you for your regular and daily visits to my humble establishment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Today it is, beyond these friendly walls, more than a little chilly; so please, I beg of you, take your time, both within and without my spotless baths, to warm yourselves at comfortable leisure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hey, you there you in charge of the baths, make quite sure that the water is kept at precisely the proper temperature.”To which the bath attendant briefly answers, “Right.”“Now there’s an amiable fellow,” says the cracked historian of the doings of Coxinga, speaking admiringly of the aged proprietor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“To run this kind of business, you have to have his knack for it.”I was so struck by the sudden appearance of this strange old man that I decided to discontinue my overall surveillance of the bathhouse scene while I concentrated upon a more particularized scanning of so rum an individual.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I watched him, the old man, catching sight of a child some four years old who has just finished bathing, extends a mottled hand and, in that wheedling voice with which the old present their false advances to the young, calls out, “Come over here, my master.” The child, frightened by that trampled pudding of a face which the gaffer bent upon him, promptly began to scream.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The old man looked surprised.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Why!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
you’re crying!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What’s the matter?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Frightened of the old man?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, I never!” His voice showed that he was genuinely astonished but, soon giving up this coaxing as a bad job, he quickly switched his attentions to the child’s father.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Hello, Gen-san!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How are you?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A bit cold today, eh?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And what about that burglar who broke into the big shop round the corner?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Must have been a fathead.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He cut a square hole in the wooden side-gate but then, can you believe it, took off without nicking a thing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Must have seen a copper or a watchman, I suppose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But what a waste of effort, eh!” Still grinning at the idea of the burglar’s rash stupidity, he turns to someone else.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Isn’t it cold, though!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps, being young, you don’t yet feel how it bites.” It seems to me that, unique in his antiquity, he’s the only person in the building who feels the cold at all.Having been thus absorbed for several minutes in studying the old man’s antics, I had virtually forgotten about all the other monsters, including my own master who was presumably still wedged in his boiling corner.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was jerked from my absorption by a sudden loud shouting in the middle of the room.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And who should be the source of it but Mr.Sneaze himself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That my master’s voice should be overloud and dis-agreeably indistinct is nothing new, but I was a little surprised to hear it raised in this particular place.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I guessed in a flash that his raucous yaw-ping had been caused by a rush of blood to his noddle in consequence of his unwisely protracted immersion in water heated up to cure all ills.Naturally, no one would object to such a hullaballoo, however raspingly unpleasant, if it were brought on by physical distress: but, as grew obvious soon enough, my beloved master, far from being geyser-dizzied out of his normal senses, was in fact being very much his own true self when he started bawling in that thickly violent voice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For the cause of the nasty uproar was a childishly idiotic squabble which he had started with some conceited pup, some totally insignificant houseboy.“Get away from here!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Go on, further off!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’re splashing water into my pail.” His shouting scraped one’s eardrums.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One’s attitude to such outbursts depends, of course, upon one’s point of view.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One could, for instance, as I had done, conclude he had just gone potty with the heat.Another, perhaps one generous-minded person in ten thousand, might see a parallel with that courageous tongue lashing which Takayama Hikokuro dared to inflict upon a bandit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For all I know, that may have been precisely how my master saw himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But since the houseboy clearly does not see himself in the bandit’s role, we are unlikely to witness a successful repetition of that historic encounter.“I was sitting here long before you came and plumped yourself down.” The boy’s reply, calmly delivered over his shoulder, was not unreasonable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, since that answer made it clear that the lad was not prepared to budge, it did not please my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, even though his blood was up, must have realized that neither the words nor the style of their delivery could really be picked upon as those of a bandit, but his howling outburst was not in fact occasioned by the boy’s propinquity or any splashing of water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The truth was that, for some considerable time, the boy and his equally young companion had been swapping remarks in a pertly unpleasing manner utterly inappropriate to their age.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master had endured their prattle for as long as he could but, more and more exasperated, had finally blown up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, even though he had been perfectly civilly answered, the real cause of his fury remained unsoothed and he could not bring himself to leave the place without a last explosion of his heart.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Hobbledehoys,” he shouted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Damned young idiots.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Splashing your dirty water in other people’s pails.”In my own heart of hearts I felt considerable sympathy for my master, because I, too, had found the boys’ behavior actively distasteful.Nevertheless, I was bound to regard my master’s behavior during the incident as conduct unbecoming in a teacher.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The trouble is that he is, by nature, something of a dry, old stick.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Far too strict and far too rigid.Not only is he as rough and dessicated as a lump of coke, but he’s also cinder-hard.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m told that years ago when Hannibal was crossing the Alps, the advance of his army was impeded by a gigantic rock inconveniently blocking the mountain path.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Hannibal is said to have soused the stone with vinegar and then to have lit a bonfire underneath it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The rock thus softened, he sawed it into segments, like someone slicing fish-paste, and so passed all his army safely on its way.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A man like my master, on whom no effect whatsoever is produced by hours of steady boiling in a medicated bath, ought perhaps to be soused with vinegar and then grilled on an open fire.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Failing some such treatment, his granitic obstinacy will not be softened though hordes of houseboys niggle away at the igneous rock of his nature for a hundred thousand years.The objects floating in the bath and lazing about on the bathroom’s floor are all monsters, teratoids dehumanized by the husking of their clothes; as such, they cannot be judged by normal civilized standards.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In their teratical world anyone can do what he likes, anything can happen.A stomach can resite itself in a pulmonary location; Coxinga can be blood-kin to the Seiwa Minamotos; and that Mr. Tami, much maligned, may well be unreliable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But as soon as those naked objects emerge from their bathhouse into the normal world, they garb themselves in obedience to the requirements of civilization and, once robed, they resume the nature and behavior patterns of human beings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master stands on the threshold between two worlds.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Standing as he does between the bathroom and the changing room, he is poised at the verge of his return to worldliness, to the sad mundanities of man, to the suavities of compromise, the specious words, and the accommodating practices of his species in society.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If, on the verge of returning to that world, he yet maintains so brute an obstinacy, surely his mokelike stubbornness must be a deep-rooted disease; a disease, indeed, so very firmly rooted as to be virtually ineradicable.In my humble opinion, there is only one cure for his condition, and that would be to get the principal of his school to give him the sack.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, being unable to adapt himself to any change of circumstances, would, if sacked, undoubtedly end up on the streets, and, if thus turned adrift, would equally certainly die in the gutter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In short, to sack him would be to kill him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master loves being ill, but he would very much hate to die.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He welters in hypochondriacal orgies of self-pity, but lacks the strength of soul to seriously look on death.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, if anyone scares him with the news that some continued illness must Iead to his demise, my craven master will immediately be both terrified out of his wits and, as I see it, terrified also into the best of health.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only the terror of death by dismissal can shrivel the roots of his almost ineradicable stubbornness.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And if dismissal doesn’t do the trick, well then, that, I’m afraid, is that, and the poor old perisher will perish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Still, in all, that foolish, fond old man, sick or well, remains my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was he who in my kittenhood took me in and fed me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I recall the tale of the Chinese poet who, given a meal when starving, later repaid that debt by saving his benefactor’s life, and I consider it should not be impossible for a cat at least to be moved by his master’s fate.My soul brims full with pity and I become so preoccupied with the internal spectacle of the generous workings of my own deep-feeling heart that, once again, my attention wandered from the scene sprawled out below me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was sharply brought back to reality by a hubbub of abuse coming from the medicinal bath.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thinking that maybe another squabble has broken out, I shift my gaze to find the throng of monsters all shoving and shouting as they struggle to get out of the narrow cleft of the adit to the bath.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Horribly hairy legs and horrible hairless things are juxtaposed and tangled in a horrible squirm to escape.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is the early evening of an autumn day, and a red-gold flattish light burns here and there upon the boiling steam which rises up to the ceiling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Through the hot, foggy veils whose swirlings fill the room I catch appalling glimpses of wild stampeding monsters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Their shrieks and bellows pierce my ears, and from all sides their agonized shouting that the bloody water’s boiling, mix in my skull as one loud howl of anguish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The shouts were mul-ticolored: some yellow with sheer fear, some a despairing blue, some furiously scarlet, some a revengeful black.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They spilt across each other, filling the bathroom with crashing columns of indescribable noise, the din of pandemonium, such sounds as have no context but Hell and the public bathhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Fascinated by this truly awful sight, I just stood there as though riveted to my ledge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The hideous roar climbed to a sort of blubbering climax where the pressure of mindless sound seemed just about to burst the walls apart when, from the swaying mass of turnbling naked bodies, a veritable giant lifted into view.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He stands a good three inches taller than the tallest of his fellows.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not only that, but his radish-colored face is thickly bearded.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The effect is so remarkable that one daren’t affirm that the beard is actually growing on that face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It might be that the face has somehow got entangled in that beard.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This apparition emits a booming sound like a large, cracked temple bell struck in the heat of noon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Pour in cold water.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quick,” he thundered.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“This bath is on the boil.” Both voice and face towered above the squawking rabble around him, and for a moment a sort of silence reigned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The giant had become the only person in the room.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A superman; a living embodiment of Nietzsche’s vision of Uebermensch; the Demon King among his swarm of devils; the master-monster; Tyrannosaurus Rex.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I stood goggling at him, someone beyond the bath answered through the sudden calm with a grunting cry of, “Yah.” Assent?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Derision?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I shall never know.All I can say is that when I peered through the dark haze to identify the source of that ambiguous response, I could just make out the figure of the bathhouse attendant, padded still in his sleeveless vest, using all his strength to heave a whacking great lump of coal into the opened lid of the furnace.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The coal made cracking sounds, and the attendant’s profile came radiantly alight.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Behind his body the brick wall gleamed with fire and the reflected glare burned at me through the darkness.Thoroughly alarmed, I reared back from the window and, with one turning spring, hopped down and ran off home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But as I ran I pondered what I’d seen and the conclusions were clear.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Although the human creatures in that bathhouse had been seeking a monstrous equality by stripping off their clothes, even from that leveling stark-nakedness a hero had emerged to tower above his fellows.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I did not know what had happened to that hero, but I was certainly sure that equality is unachievable, however stark things may become.On reaching home, I find that all is peaceful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, his face still glowing from the bath, is quietly eating supper: but, catching sight of me as I jump up onto the veranda, he breaks his silence to remark, “What a happy-go-lucky cat!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I wonder what he’s been up to, coming home as late as this.”My master has little money, but I note that on the table tonight there are laden dishes for a three-course meal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Grilled fish will be one of them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I don’t know what the fish is called, but I guess it was probably caught in the sea off Shinagawa sometime yesterday.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have already expatiated at length upon the natural healthiness of fish as fostered by their salt environment; however, once a fish has been caught and boiled or, like this one, grilled, questions of environmental advantage are just no longer relevant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This fish would have done much better to stay alive in the sea, even if, in the course of time, it had eventually to suffer such ills as all fish-flesh is heir to.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So thinking, I sat myself down beside the table.I pretended not to look while looking; looking, in particular, for a chance to snatch a piece of anything edible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Those who do not know how to look while not looking must give up any hope of ever eating good fish.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master pecked in silence at the fish, but soon put down his chopsticks as if to say that he didn’t much like the taste.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His wife, seated directly opposite him in matching silence, is anxiously watching how his chopsticks move up and down and whether my master’s jaws are opening and closing.“I say,” he suddenly asked her, “give that cat a whack on the head.”“What happens if I whack it?”“Never you mind what happens: just whack it.”“Like this?” asks his wife, tapping my head with the palm of her hand.It didn’t hurt at all.“Well, look at that!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It didn’t give the least miaow.”“No,” she says, “it didn’t.”“Then whack it again.”“It’ll be just the same, however often I try.” She gave me another tap on the head.Since I still felt nothing, I naturally kept quiet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But what could be the point of these peculiar orders?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As a prudent and intelligent cat, I find my master’s behavior utterly incomprehensible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Any person who could understand what he’s driving at, would then know how to react, but it’s not that easy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His wife is simply told to “whack it,” but she, the whack-er, is self-statedly at a loss to know why she should whack; I, the unfortunate whackee, am no less lost to understand what it’s all about.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master is becoming a little edgily impatient, for twice already his instructions have failed to produce the result which he only knows that he desires.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is therefore almost sharply that he says, “Whack it so that it miaows.”His wife assumed a resigned sort of expression and wearily asking,“Why on earth should you want to make the wretched thing miaow?”gave me another, slightly harder, slap.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now that I know what he wants, it’s all absurdly easy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I can satisfy my master with a mere miaow, but it’s really rather depressing, not just to witness but actually to participate in, yet another demonstration of his addlepated conduct.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he wanted me to miaow, he should have said so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His wife would have been spared two or three totally unnecessary efforts, and I would not have needed to endure more than a single whack.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An order to whack should only be given when only a whack is wanted, but in this case what was wanted was simply a miaow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now whacking may indeed fall within his sphere of responsibility, but miaowing lies in mine.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s a damned impertinence that he should dare to assume that an instruction to whack includes, or implies, an instruction to miaow, which is a matter totally within my discretion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he is taking my miaows for granted, indeed he presumes too far.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such failure to respect another person’s personality, a deadly insult to any cat, is the sort of crude insensitivity which one must expect from creatures like my master’s own particular pet aversion, the nauseous Mr.Goldfield.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the same behavior on the part of my master, a man so confident of his open-heartedness that he struts about stark-naked, can only be seen as an act of unwonted weakness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet, as I know, my master is not mean.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
From which it follows that his venture into whacking was not motivated by any deviousness or malice.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In my opinion, his orders were hatched in a brain as guileless and dim as that of a mosquito larva.If one gobbles rice, one’s stomach becomes full.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one is cut, one bleeds.If one is killed, one dies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Therefore, such reasoning runs, if one is whacked, one must perforce miaow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though I have done my best to justify my master’s ways toward me, I regret to be bound to point out the clottish absurdity of such a style of logic.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For if one were to concur in that logic, it would follow that if one falls in a river, one is required to drown; that if one eats fried fish, one must then get the squatters; that if one gets a salary, one must turn up for work; and that if one studies books, one cannot fail to make oneself a great name in the world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If that were the way things worked, there’d be some a bit embarrassed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I, for instance, would find it annoying to be obliged to miaow when whacked.What, I ask, would be the point of being born a cat if, like the bell-clock at Mejiro, one is expected to give off sounds every time one’s struck?Having thus mentally reprimanded my presumptuous master, then and then only I obliged him with a mew.As soon as I miaowed, my master turned to his wife.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Hear that?” he said.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Now tell me, is a miaow an interjection or an adverb?”The question was so abrupt that Mrs. Sneaze said nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To tell the truth, my own immediate reaction was to think that, after all, he really had been driven out of his mind by his experiences in the bathhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is, of course, well-known in the neighborhood for his eccentricities.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve even heard him called a clear case of neurosis.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, my master’s self-conceit is so unshakable that he insists that, far from being a neurotic himself, it is his detractors in whom neurotic tendencies are clear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When his neighbors call him a dog, he calls them, in mere fairness, so he puts it, filthy pigs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He seems, indeed, besotted with maintaining his ideas of fairness: to the point of being a positive public nuisance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He really sees nothing odd in asking questions as ludicrous as that last enquiry to his wife about the proper parsing of a cat’s miaow, but to the general run of his listeners his questions do suggest a certain mental instability.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, his wife, understandably mystified, makes no attempt to answer him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For obvious reasons, I too can offer nothing in reply.My master waited for a moment and then, in a loud voice, suddenly shouted out, “Hey!”His wife looked up in surprise and answered, “Yes?”“Is that ‘yes’ an interjection or an adverb?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tell me now, which is it?”“Whichever it is, it surely doesn’t matter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What a silly thing to ask!”“On the contrary, it matters a very great deal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That grammatical problem is an issue currently preoccupying the best brains among leading authorities on linguistics in Japan.”“Gracious me!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You mean that our leading authorities are bending their brains to a cat’s miaow?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a dreadful state of affairs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, cats don’t speak in Japanese.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Surely, a miaow is a word from the language of cats.”“That’s precisely the point.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The problem is a hard one in the very difficult field of comparative linguistics.”“Is that indeed so?” It is clear that she is sufficiently intelligent to be disinterested in such silly matters.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“And have these leading authorities yet discovered what part of speech compares with a cat’s miaow?”“It’s so serious a problem that it can’t immediately be resolved.” He munches away at that fish, and then proceeds to tuck into the next course of stewed pork and potatoes.“This will be pork, won’t it?”“Yes, it’s pork.”“Huh,” he grunted in tones of deep disdain.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Huh,” and then guzzled it down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thereafter, holding out a saké cup, “I’ll have another cup.”“You’re drinking rather a lot today.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Already you look quite red.”“Certainly I’m drinking,” he began, but broke off to veer away on a new mad tack.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Do you know,” he demanded, “the longest word in the world?”“I think I’ve heard it somewhere.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let me think now.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Yes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Isn’t it ‘Hoshoji-no-Nyudo-Saki-no-Kampaku-dajodaijin?’”“No, I don’t mean a title like that ‘Former Chief Adviser to the Emperor and Prime Minister.’ I mean a true, long word.”“Do you mean one of those crab-written sideways words from the West?”“Yes.”“Well then, no.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That I wouldn’t know.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But I do know that you’ve had quite enough saké.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’ll have some rice now, won’t you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Right?”“Wrong.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
First I’ll drink some more.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Would you like to know that longest word?”“All right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But after, you’ll have some rice?”“The word is ‘Archaiomelesidonophrunicherata.’”“You made it up.”“Of course I didn’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s Greek.”“What does it mean in Japanese?”“I don’t know what it means.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I only know its spelling.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even if written sparingly it will cover about six and a quarter inches.”It is my master’s singularity that he makes this sort of statement, which most men would vouchsafe in their cups, in dead cold sobriety.All the same, it’s certainly true that he’s drinking far too much tonight.He normally limits himself to no more than a couple of cups of saké, and he’s already tossed back four.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His normal dosage turns his face quite red, so the double dosage has inevitably flushed his features to the color of red-hot tongs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He looks to be in some distress, but he keeps on knocking them back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He extends the cup again.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“One more,” he says.His wife, finding this really too much, makes a wry face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Don’t you think you’ve had enough?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’ll only get a pain.”“Never mind the pain.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From now on, I’m going to train myself into a steady drinker.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Oinachi Keigetsu has recommended that I devote myself to drink.”“And who may this Keigetsu be?” Great and famous though he is, in the eyes of Mrs. Sneaze he isn’t worth a ha’penny.“Keigetsu is a literary colleague, a first-rate critic of these present times.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He has advised me to spend less time at home communing with a cat, to get out and about, and to drink on all occasions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since he’s almost a doctor, albeit one of literature, it would seem all right to drink on doctor’s orders.”“Don’t be so ridiculous!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I don’t care what he’s called or who he is.It’s none of his business to urge other people to drink; especially people who happen to have weak stomachs.”“He didn’t just recommend drinking.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He also said I ought to be more sociable and take a fling at the fast life: wine, women, song, even travel.”“Are you actually trying to tell me that a so-called first-class critic has been making such outrageous suggestions?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What kind of a man can he be?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Truly, I’m shocked to learn that presumably responsible literary figures would recommend that a married man should go out on the loose.”“There’s nothing wrong with living it up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I had the money, I wouldn’t need Keigetsu’s encouragement before giving it a try.”“Well then, I’m very glad that you don’t have the money.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would be quite awful if a man your age started gallivanting about with wanton girls and drunken half-wit critics.”“Since the idea seems to shock you, I’ll scrap my plans for kicking over the traces.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, in consideration of that connubial self-sacrifice, you’ll have to take better care of your husband and, in particular, serve him better dinners.”“I’m already doing the best I can on what you give me.”“Really?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well in that case, I’ll postpone my investigation of the fast life until I can afford it, and, for tonight, I won’t take any more saké.”With what might just pass for a smile, he held out his rice bowl for his wife to fill from the container.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I remember it, he thereupon got through three great bowlfuls of mixed rice and tea.My meal that night consisted of three slices of pork and the grilled head of that nameless fish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"VOLUME IIIIWHEN I WAS describing my fence trotting exercises,I must have mentioned that bamboo fence which encloses my master’s garden.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Beyond that fence to the south of us there is another dwelling, but it would be an error to assume that our neighbors are just anybody.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Admittedly, it is a low-rent area, but Mr. Sneaze is a person of some standing, and certainly not the sort of man to establish chatty relationships across a backyard fence with any old Tom, Dick, or Harry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the other side of our particular fence there is an open space about thirty feet deep at the far end, in which stands a dark green row of five or six heavily foliaged cypresses.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one looks at this scene from our veranda, the impression it creates is of a deep and thickly wooded forest, and one feels that here is a lonely house in a glade where some learned sage, indifferent to fame, and wealth, leads out his solitary life with only a nameless cat for his companion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, the cypresses do not, in fact, grow quite as thickly as I’d like to make out, for through their greenery one can, with hurtful clarity, descry the undistinguished roof of a cheap boarding house of which the only redeeming feature is its soul-astounding name: Crane Flock Manor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You will appreciate that it consequently takes a real effort of the imagination to fit my master as I’ve hitherto described him into such a high-falutin’ background.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet, if that crumby boarding house can bear so grand a name, then surely my master’s home deserves at least to be known as the Cave of the Sleeping Dragon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since there’s no tax on house names, one might as well select a name which sounds impressive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, this open space to the south of us, of a north-south depth of some thirty feet, extends on an east-west axis for about sixty feet along our bamboo fence, and then turns at a right angle northward to run along the eastern side of the Cave of the Sleeping Dragon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now it is in this northern area that trouble has arisen.One might dare boast that this open space, stretching as it does around two whole sides of our dwelling, is big enough to please anyone, but in point of fact not only the master of the house but even I, the dragon’s resident sacred cat, are often at our wits’ end to know what to do with so much emptiness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as the cypress trees lord it to the south, so to the north the scene is dominated by some seven or eight paulownias standing in a row.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since those trees have each now grown to be a good twelve inches around, one could make a pretty packet by selling their highly fancied wood to the first clog-maker whom one pared to call in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unfortunately, even if my unworldly dragon could rise to such an idea, being no more than a tenant of his cavern, he couldn’t put it into practice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My heart bleeds for my half-wit master.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Especially so when I recall that only the other day some lowly drudge of a porter at his school came around and calmly cut a large branch from one tree.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
On his next visit he was sporting an exceedingly fancy pair of paulownia-wood clogs and was boasting to everyone within earshot that his clogs were made from the branch he’d stolen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such cunning villains flourish; but for me and for the rest of my master’s household, though those valuable paulownias are within our daily grasp, they profit us nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s an old adage that to hold a gem invites misfortune, which is generally interpreted to mean that it is opportunity which creates a thief.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But in our sad case the plain fact is that growing paulownias earn no money.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There they are, as pointlessly valuable as gold left in the ground, but the numbskull in this matter is neither myself nor my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s the landlord, Dembei, a man so dense, so deaf that even when his trees are positively shouting for a clog-maker, begging aloud to be cut, he takes not the slightest notice, but just comes and collects his rent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, since I bear no grudge against our landlord, I’ll say no more about his crazy conduct and revert to my main theme, that is to say, to the odd series of events whereby that open space came to be the cause of so much strife and tribulation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if I tell you the inwardness of it all, you mustn’t, ever, let on to my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"These words of mine, remember, are between you and me and the gatepost.The immediately obvious snag about that open space is that it is indeed entirely open: unenclosed, no kind of fence around it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is a breezy, easy, go-as-you-pleasy sort of right-of-way: it is, in short, a good, honest open space.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I must, however, confess that my use of the present tense is misleading, for, more precisely, I should have said that it was a good honest open space.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As always, one cannot understand the present situation without tracing its development back to causes rooted in the ancient past.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since even doctors cannot prescribe cures unless they first have diagnosed the causes of disorder, I will take my time and, beginning my story from its true beginning, go back to those days when my master first moved into his present home.It’s always pleasant in the humid days of summer to have plenty of airy space around one’s house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course such open sites offer to burglars the advantage of easy access, but there’s little risk of burglary where there’s nothing worth the thieving.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hence my master’s house has never stood in need of any kind of outer wall, thorn-hedge, stockade, or even the flimsiest fence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, it seems to me that the need for such defensive structures is really determined by the nature of whatever creatures, human or animal, which happen to live on the other side of any such open space.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
From which it follows that I must clarify the nature of the gentlemen dwelling to the north of us.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It may seem rather rash to call them gentlemen before I have clearly established whether those beings are human or animal, but it’s usually safer to start by assuming that everyone’s a gentleman.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After all, we have the authority of the Chinese classics for calling a sneak-thief hiding in the rafters a “gentleman on the beam.” However, the gentlemen in our particular case are not, at least individually, criminal characters such as trouble the police.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Instead, the criminality of these neighbors seems to be a function of their enormous number.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For there are swarms of them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Swarms and swarms of pupils at a private middle school which, rejoicing in the name of the Hall of the Descending Cloud, collects two yen a month from each of eight hundred young gentlemen in return for training them to become even yet more gentlemanly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But you’d be making a serious mistake if you deduced from the elegant name of their school that all its students were gentlemen of elegance and taste.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as no crane ever flocks to the seedy roosts in Crane Flock Manor, just as the Cave of the Sleeping Dragon in fact contains a cat, so the tasteful name of our neighboring school is an unreliable indicator of the true degree of its occu-pants’ refinement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since you have already learnt that a madman like my master can be held to be included within the ranks of university men, even of lecturers, you should have no difficulty in grasping what louts may well be numbered among the inferentially polished gentlemen in the Hall of the Descending Cloud.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If my point is still not clear, a three-day visit to my master’s house will certainly drive it home.As I’ve already mentioned, when my master first moved into his house there was no fence around the empty space; consequently, the gentlemen of the Hall, just like Rickshaw Blacky, used to saunter about among the paulownias, chatting, eating from their lunchboxes, lying down on the clumps of bamboo-grass, doing, in fact, whatever they fancied.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After a while they began using the paulownia grove for dumping their discardable rubbish—first the corpses of their lunch-boxes (that is to say, the bamboo wrapping-sheaths and odd sheets of old newspaper)—but soon they took to dumping worn-out sandals, broken clogs, anything in fact that needed pitching out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, typically indifferent, showed no concern about these developments and did not even bother to lodge a protest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I don’t know whether he failed to notice what was going on or whether, noticing, he decided not to make a fuss.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, those gentlemen from the Hall seem to have grown ever more like gentlemen as they advanced in their education, for they gradually extended their disgusting activities on the northern side of the open space to encroach upon its southern area.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you object that a word like “encroach” should be used in reference to gentlemen, I am willing to abandon it; however, there is in truth no other word to describe the process whereby these gentlemen, like so many desert nomads, emerged from their paulownia wastes to advance upon the cypresses.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Inasmuch as the cypress trees stand right in front of our living room, it was at first only the most daring of these elegant young men who dared to venture so far, but, within a matter of days, such daring had grown general, and the more sturdy of the venturers had moved on to greater things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There is nothing quite so terrifying as the results of education.Having thus successfully advanced to the actual side of the house, these educated youths then launched upon us an assault of song.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have forgotten the name of their song, but it was certainly not a classical composition, being distinctly lively in the catchy style of certain popular ditties.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master was not the only person who was surprised, for I, too, was so much impressed by the range of talents displayed by these young gentlemen that I found myself listening to their singing in spite of myself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, as my readers may already know, it is perfectly possible to be both impressed and seriously disturbed by the same occurrences.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, upon reflection, it strikes me as regrettable that, as in the present case, the two reactions should so often be simultaneously evoked; I have no doubt that my master shared my sense of regret.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, he had no real choice but, on two or three occasions, to come rushing out of his study and drive them off his property with such stern rebukes as, “This is not the place for you” and “I’d be obliged if you’d go.”Of course, since the offenders are educated gentlemen, they show no disposition to meekly obey my master’s exhortations; no sooner have they been turned out but back they come again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And once they’re back they start again on their less than seemly singing interspersed with loud-voiced chat and banter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s more, and of course because they’re gentlemen, their language differs from that in common use.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They use such words as “youse” and “dunno.” Such words, I understand, were, until the Restoration, part of the professional vocabulary of footmen, palanquin-carriers, and bathhouse attendants; however, in the present century, they have become the only style of language deserving study by an educated gentleman.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve heard it said that a similar social climb can be observed in the matter of taking physical exercise, for physical jerks, once generally scorned as an activity proper only to the lower classes, are now most warmly smiled upon at the highest levels of society.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, on the occasion when one of my master’s frantic sallies from his study actually resulted in the capture of a student skilled in this new language of the gentry, the prisoner, no doubt frightened into forgetting the subtleties of modern educated speech, offered an explanation for his intrusion in such extremely vulgar terms as, “Please accept my most sincere apologies, but I had, Sir, the mistaken impression that this area was the school’s botanical garden.”Having subjected his victim to a cautionary lecture, my master turned him loose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which is a silly sounding form of words, more suited to the liberation of newly hatched baby turtles, but nevertheless appropriate in that my master kept a firm grip on his prisoner’s sleeve throughout the process of his reprehension.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Naturally enough, my master confidently expected that the force of his winged words would be sufficient to halt the nomadic inroads, but, as has been well known since the earliest days of recorded Chinese history, there is a vast difference between expectation and reality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, my master’s expectations were quickly proved misplaced.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The young gentlemen now began to enter the open space from their northern side, walk boldly straight across it, then across our garden, and complete their short cut into the road beyond by use of our front gate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The sound of its opening naturally led us to expect the pleasure of visitors, so it was all the more infuriating to, in fact, receive nothing more than the noise of vulgar laughter from the direction of the paulownias.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Things were clearly going from bad to worse.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The effects of education grew daily more apparent until, recognizing that the situation had gone beyond his own powers of control, my master shut himself up in his study and there composed a politely worded letter to the headmaster of the Hall asking that a little closer control be exercised over the high spirits of his students.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The headmaster, in similarly courteous terms, replied with an expression of regret for past intrusions and a plea for a little more patience pending the construction, for which he had already arranged, of a fence between the two properties.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Shortly thereafter, a few workmen turned up and, in a scant half day, set up along the borderline a so-called four-eye fence of open-work bamboo approximately three feet high.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, poor old duffer, was delighted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Daft as ever, he glowed in the false conviction that the nomadic raids had now been walled away, but what man in his right mind could possibly believe that a real change in the behavior of gentlemen can be wrought by the flimsy magic of a dwarfish bamboo fence?One must, of course, recognize that there is a vast fund of pleasure to be drawn from the provocation of human beings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even a cat like myself sometimes derives amusement from teasing my master’s otherwise uninteresting daughters.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So it is entirely understandable that the bright young gentlemen at the Hall should have found it rewarding to tease such a dimwit as my master.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The only person who objects to teasing is, of course, the person teased.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Analysis of the psychology of teasing reveals two major aspects of its successful pursuit.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First, the person or persons teased must never be allowed to remain calm.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Secondly, the person or persons teasing must be stronger than the teasee(s) both in sheer power and in mere number.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Only the other day my master, who had gone off to gawp in some zoo, came home to recount an incident there which had particularly impressed him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He had, apparently, taken time to watch some idiotic rumpus between a small dog and a camel.The small dog, barking like mad, had scampered like a whirlwind around and around the camel, while the camel, paying no whit of attention, had simply stood there, stolidly patient under the burden of its hump.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unable to provoke the slightest stir of interest from the camel, the little dog had eventually barked itself into a disgusted silence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, too dull to see the relevance of that experience to his own circumstances, had seen the camel’s dull insensitivity as nothing more than comic; and he laughed a lot as he told his tale.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, that incident does clearly illustrate one major facet of the business of teasing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No matter how skilled the teaser, his efforts will be wasted if the teasee happens to be as dull (or as intelligent) as a camel.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, should the victim happen to be as inordinately strong as a lion or a tiger, the teaser will quickly find himself involved in the yet more total disappointment of being ripped to shreds.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when the teaser has accurately determined that his victim, however deeply angered, still can do nothing in effective retaliation, then indeed the joys of provocation can be drawn from a bot-tomless well.Why, one may ask, does teasing offer such endless pleasure?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There are several reasons.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First and foremost, it is the most marvelous way for killing time, better for the bored than counting one’s whiskers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of all the tribulations in this world, boredom is the one most hard to bear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve even heard that, long ago, there was a prisoner so crazed by solitary confinement that he passed his days in drawing triangles, one upon another, all over the walls of his cell.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For unless one does something, indeed anything, to incite a sense of purpose in one’s life, one cannot go on living.Thus, the amusement in teasing derives in no small part from the stir, the stimulus, which it gives to the teaser.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But it is, of course, obvious that it’s worthless as a stimulant unless it successfully provokes in others a sufficient degree of that irritation, anger, even distress, which makes the teaser’s life worth living.Study of the annals of history discloses that there are two main types of people disposed to indulge in teasing: those of an utterly bored or witless mind and those who need to prove to themselves their superiority to others.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The first group includes such creatures as those bored feudal lords who neither understood nor cared about the fellings of other people, a group which is nowadays best represented by boys so infantile, so mentally stunted, that, while having no time to think of anything but their own fool pleasures, they have insufficient intelligence to see how, even in that sub-puerile pursuit, best to employ their vitality.The second main group of teasers realizes that one can demonstrate superiority by killing, hurting, or imprisoning other people, but that such a proof only occurs as a sort of by-product from situations where the real objective is to hurt, kill, or jail.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, should one wish to demonstrate superiority without going to the lengths (or running the risks) of inflicting major damage; the ideal method is by teasing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In practice it is impossible to prove one’s superiority without inflicting some degree of injury, and the proof has to be practical because no one derives adequate or pleasurable confidence in his prowess from mere conviction thereof within the privacy of his own mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is of course true that the human creature characteristically prides itself on its self-reliance.However, it would be more exact to say that the creature, knowing it can’t rely upon itself, would very much like to believe that it could and is consequently never at ease with itself until it can give a practical demonstration to some other such creature of how much it can rely upon itself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s more, those endowed with the least intelligence and those least sure of themselves are precisely those who seize upon the slightest opportunity to demonstrate their entitlement to some sort of certificate of prowess.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One can observe the same phenomenon in the world of judo, whose devotees, every so often, feel the need to heave someone or other over their buttocks and smack them down on the ground.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The least proficient of these dedicated cross-buttockers wander about their neighborhoods looking for someone, even for someone not of their quaint fraternity, upon whose weaker person they can demonstrate their superiority in using their bottoms to sling the upright flat on their backs.There are many other considerations which make teasing a popular and admirable activity, but, since it would take a long time to set them all down here, I will say no more upon the topic.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, anyone interested in deepening his understanding of this fascinating subject is always welcome to call upon me, bearing a proper fee in dried bonito, for further instruction.Perhaps I might usefully offer the following succinct conclusion based upon my foregoing remarks, namely, that in my opinion the ideal subjects for teasing are zoo monkeys and school teachers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would be disrespectful to compare a school teacher with a monkey in the Asakusa Zoo, disrespectful, that is, not to monkeys but to teachers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But truths will always come out, and no one can deny how close the resemblance is.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As you know, the Asakusa monkeys are restricted by link-chain leash-es so that, though they may snarl and screech to their hearts’ content, they cannot scratch a soul.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, though teachers are not actually kept on chains, they are very effectively shackled by their salaries.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They can be teased in perfect safety.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They won’t resign or use their teeth on their pupils.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Had they sufficient spunk to resign, they would not originally have allowed themselves to sink into the slavery of teaching.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master is a teacher.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though he does not teach at the Hall, still he is a teacher and just the man for the job: inoffensive, salary-shackled, a man designed by nature for schoolboys to torment in total safety.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The pupils at the Hall are gentlemanly youths who not only consider it proper to practice teasing as a part of their rite of passage into the superiority of manhood, but who also believe that they are by right entitled to be tormentors as a due fruit by their education.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Moreover, a sizable proportion of these lively lads would not know how to occupy their limbs and brains through the long ten minutes of the morning break if a kindly nature failed to provide them with a target for persecution.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In such circumstances it is as inevitable that my wretched master should be teased as it is that the yobbos from the Hall should do the teasing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Given that inevitability, it seems to me quite ludicrous, a new high point in his long ascent to the thin-aired peaks of pure fatuity, that my master should have allowed himself to be provoked into so much pointless anger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nonetheless, I shall now recount in detail how those pupils teased him and with what boorish folly he responded.I assume my readers need no description of a four-eye fence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I, for instance, can move back and forth through its lattices with such complete freedom that it might as well not be there.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, the headmaster of the Hall did not have cats in mind when he arranged for the fence to be erected.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His only concern was to provide a fence through which the young gentlemen of his school could not pass; I must confess that, freely as the winds may move between its bamboo laths, I see no way in which a man or boy could do the same.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even for such an accomplished contortionist as Chang Shih-tsun, that Chinese magician who flourished in the days of the Ch’ing, it would be hard to weasel a way through a wall of apertures each no more than a tight four inches square.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being thus impenetrable by human beings, it is understandable that the fence when first erected left my master happy with the thought that he was safe at last.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, there’s a hole in the logic of my master’s thinking, a hole far bigger than the squares in the four-eye fence.Indeed, the hole’s so vast that it could easily let through even that monster fish which, in Chinese legend, once swallowed a whole ship.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The point is this.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master assumes that a fence is something not to be crossed, from which follows his second assumption that no schoolboy worthy of that name would force his way past any fence which, however humble, can be recognized as indeed a fence and, as such, a clear identifier of a boundary-line.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even if my master were able to temporarily set aside those two assumptions, he would nevertheless still calculate that the smallness of the open-work squares provided genuine protec-tion even against any such improbable youth as might dare to contemplate forcing his way through them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He all too hastily concluded he was safe simply because it was obvious that not even the smallest and most determined boy, unless he happened to be a cat, could possibly squeeze through the fence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the massive flaw in his analysis lay in the fact that nothing is more easy than to climb or jump a fence but three feet high.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which, quite apart from the fun of it, also offers excellent physical exercise.From the day following the erection of the fence, the young gentlemen from the Hall began jumping into the northern portion of the open space with the same regularity as they had previously just walked across.But they no longer advance to their earlier forward positions right in front of our living room because, if they are now chased, it will take them a little longer to reach the safety of school land by reason of the new need to get back over the four-eye fence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So they loaf about in the middle distance where they run no risk whatever of being caught.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
From his detached room on the east side of our house my master cannot see what the boys are doing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For that purpose one must either go out to the garden gate and there look at a right angle into the open space or else one must go to the inside lavatory and peer out through its little window.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From that latter position my master can very clearly see what is going on, but, however many the intruders upon his property, nothing can be done to catch them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All he can do is to shout unheeded scoldings through the window grille.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he tries a sally through the garden gate into enemy-occupied territory, the sound of his approaching footsteps gives them ample time to scoot away, nimbly clear the fence, and continue their hooting from the safety of school land.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master’s tactics of creep-and-rush are much like those adopted by sea-poachers trying to surprise seals as they bask in the sun.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Naturally, my master cannot spend his whole life either peering from the loo or dashing out through the garden gate in response to every stimulus of sound from the open space.He would have to give up teaching and concentrate on full-time self-employment as a yobbo-hunter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The weakness of his position is that from his study he can hear, but not see his enemies, while from the lavatory he has them in plain view but can do nothing more effective than yell his silly head off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His enemies, full aware of his dilemma, have shaped their strategy to exploit his difficulties.When the young gentlemen are sure that my master is in his study, they set up a racket of talk so deliberately loud that my master cannot avoid hearing the cracks they make about him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To salt his mortification, they vary the volume of their comments so that he can never be certain whether their babble originates from his or their side of the four-eye fence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When my master makes one of his forays, they either scuttle off or, if they happen already to be in their own territory, they stare at him with insolent indifference.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When my master is lurking in his lavatory—I regret, indeed I would normally disparage, this constant use of that somewhat indelicate word, but in battle reports one is duty-bound to be topographically accurate—his tormentors loaf about under the paulownias and take pains to draw his attention to their unwelcome presence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, as soon as he starts raving at them through the window-grille, they, cool as little cucumbers, let the roar of his abuse flow over their heads to disturb the whole neighborhood with its ugly echos while, utterly unconcerned, they drift away into the home ground of their Hall.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"These tactics are reducing my master to a gibbering idiot.Sometimes, sure that the little louts are on his property, he dashes out with his walking stick at the ready, only to find the open space deserted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At other times, confident of their absence, he nevertheless takes a quick peep from his lavatory window, and there they are, a loathly gaggle of them, loitering on his land.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So he nips around to his garden gate and he squinnies from the john.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He squinnies from the john and he nips around to his garden gate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Over and over and over again.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you find my account repetitive, the simple reason is that I am committed to recounting endless repetitions of the same inane and equally pointless alternative behaviors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, worn to a frazzle, is clearly approaching the point of nervous breakdown.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He has become so frenziedly obsessed with his problem that one hardly knows whether he is still a professional teacher or now regards this crazy oscillation between peep and sally as his sole true calling.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And then, as the tides of his frenzy rose ever closer to the neap of madness, the following incident occurred.Some kind of incident almost always does occur when frenzy, brain-storm, wrong-way-upness, a rush of blood to the head—call the condition what you will—impairs the human power to reason clearly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All the authorities, Galen, Paracelsus, even such ancient Chinese quacks as Pien Ch’üeh, are at one in this prognosis.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There does, of course, remain some scope for debate as to where the “inverse up-rush” actually starts and as to what it is that rushes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The long outmoded lore of European medicine men held that there are four different liquids, or humors, washing around in the human body.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The first such liquid was that of choler which, when it rose inversely, produced fury.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The second liquid, that of dullness, if inversely risen, brought on lethargy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The third, the fluid of melancholy, produced, as one might have expected, melancholia.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"While the fourth, blood, was responsible for the activity of arms and legs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The progress of civilization appears, for no discernible reason, to have drained away the fluids of choler, dullness, and melancholia, so that, as I understand it, nothing now remains to circulate in our bodies but residual blood.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, if any inverse rising does indeed take place, it must be a wrong-way-up-ness of the blood.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There is, of course, a limit to the amount of blood containable in the human body and the precise volume varies slightly as between individual specimens, but, on average, every human being contains some 9.9 liters of the stuff.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now when that literage rises inversely, the head, beyond which it cannot rise, becomes heated and inordinately active, whilst the rest of the body, drained of blood, numbs with cold.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One may reasonably compare this process to the happenings in September 1905 when the populace of Tokyo, dissatisfied with the terms of the Treaty of Portsmouth, took to burning police boxes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On that occasion all the police conglomerated at headquarters, leaving no single officer out on the streets or even to defend their various police boxes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That rush to headquarters could well, medically, be diagnosed as a rush of blood to the head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And in both cases the proper cure is to re-establish the normal balanced distribution of blood (or of bloody cops) throughout the body (or body politic).,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To achieve that balance the blood, inversely risen, must be drawn back down from the head, and there are various treatments available.For instance, I understand that my master’s deceased father was in the habit of wrapping a cold, wet towel around his head and then toasting his feet on a charcoal foot-warmer; practices whose efficacy would seem to be well warranted by those passages in that Chinese medical classic, Some Thoughts on Typhoid Fever, which states that keeping the head cold and the feet warm ensures good health and guarantees longevity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A towel a day keeps the doctor away.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Another much-favored method of treatment is that in common use among the priesthood.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, it appears that, when on pilgrimage, wandering Zen priests would invariably pick out a place to rest or sleep where there was “a tree above and a stone beneath.” That slogan refers neither to any aesthetic ideal nor to the self-mortifications of penitents but to a particular technique for reversing rushes of blood to the head, which was first worked out, no doubt in his early days as a rice-pounding, kitchen scullion, by the Sixth Patriarch of the Zen sect, His Ineffable Holiness Hui Neng.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Test the method for yourself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sit on a stone and, in the nature of things, your bottom will grow cold.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As the buttocks chill, any heady sensations associated with risen blood will sink away to nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That too, beyond all shadow of doubt, is also in the nature of things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One marvels, does one not, at the percipience of the Sixth Patriarch.Thus, while a number of methods have been devised for cooling down rushes of blood to the head, I regret to report that, as of the present time, no satisfactory way to incite them has yet been invented.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, perhaps, natural that people should generally assume that there’s nothing to be gained from rushes of blood to the head, but there’s at least one context where any such sweeping judgement is likely to prove unduly hasty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, many of those engaged in the activity I have in mind would swear blind that without such rushes they could not even begin to pursue their profession.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am speaking of poets.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as coal is indispensable to a steamship, so to poets are rushes of blood to the head.Bereft of that energy source for so little as one day, poets would debate into mediocrities capable of nothing but eating and drinking in a lifelong haze of idleness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In sober truth, a rush of blood to the head is simply an attack of lunacy, but since no professional would care to admit that he cannot pursue his profession except when in a state of mental derangement, poets, even amongst themselves, do not call their madness madness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By an arrangement privately arrived at, a sort of literary conspiracy, they all seek to dazzle the foolish public by describing their derangement as inspiration.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The fact remains that we are speaking of madness.Nevertheless, poets do have Plato on their side, for he called their ailment a sacred madness, a divine afflatus.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even so, and no matter what degree of divinity may really be involved, people would refuse to regard poetry with any measure of respect if it were openly identified with lunacy, and I therefore conclude that poets are wise to cling to their inspiration because, though “inspiration” sounds to me like the name of some newly invented patent medicine, it remains an all impressive word, one behind which the pottiness of poets can most splendidly be sheltered.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When exotic-sounding delicacies in fact consist of nothing more unusual than yams, when images of the Goddess of Mercy consist of nothing more than two brief inches of rotten wood, when game soup specialities are cooked from common crow, when the best stewed beef in boarding houses is horse flesh in hot water, why should one question the reality of inspiration?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If its reality is, as it must be, madness, at least it quickly spends itself—lunacy by fits (especially fits) and starts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed it is only because their manic possession is so signally short lived that poets are not all shut away in the loony bin at Colney Hatch.I think it fair to add that these short-term maniacs, these inspired idiots, appear to be extraordinarily difficult to produce.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is painfully easy to manufacture lifelong loonies, but even the most artful God seems to have trouble fashioning beings whose manic spells are limited to those periods during which the lunatic is holding a means to write and is confronted with blank paper.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, God seldom creates such specimens.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, they have to be manufactured without divine assistance, and all down the ages, scholars have been obliged to devote as much time and effort to finding the best way to generate the flow of inspiration as they have to the problems of preventing rushes of blood to the head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One seeker after inspiration, convinced that the secret of its attainment lay in constipation, assiduously strove for that prior condition by eating a dozen unripe persimmons every day for fruitless years on end.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Another aspirant to inspiration believed he could achieve his objective by literal hotheadedness and accordingly spent his days in an iron bathtub, heated from below, consuming enormous quantities of hot saké.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Failing to achieve immediate success, he concluded that the flaw in his scheme must lie with the bath water, but unfortunately, he died before he could gather sufficient money to afford the expense of bathing in boiling port.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Yet another would-be poet placed his hopes for an inspiring rush of blood to the head in the long-received concept of acquisition through imitation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is an ancient idea that imitation of the conduct of some acknowledged master will produce in the ape the same mental state as graced the model.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"According, to this theory a man who behaves like a drunkard will eventually feel what a drunkard feels, while a man who squats sufficiently long in the attitudes of a Zen master, enduring the agony while a joss stick burns itself to nothing, will, somehow or other, experience the master’s experience of enlightenment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The adoption of that theory of imitation to the search for inspiration led to the conclusion that, if one imitated the conduct of some literary giant, one would experience the same rushes of blood to the head as had inspired his literary achievements.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am reliably advised that Victor Hugo used to think up his finest prose effects while lying on his back in a sailing boat, from which it would follow that if one can board a yacht, lie on one’s back and stare at the blue of sky, one may confidently expect an upflow of stupendous prose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since Robert Louis Stevenson is said to have written his novels while lying flat on his belly, it should be possible by worming around on the floor to have one’s brush construct whole archipelagoes of treasured islands.You can deduce, even from the modest number of examples which I’ve cited, that many persons have devised methods for generating inspiration, but none has so far proved successful, and current opinion holds that its artificial generation is impossible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which is, of course, sad, but nothing can be done about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, I am quite certain that, sooner or later, someone will find a way to produce the divine afflatus on demand and, for the sake of dull humanity, I sincerely hope that that desirable discovery is not too long delayed.I feel that I have spoken at more than sufficient length about rushes of blood to the head, and I will therefore now revert to my account of the crisis mounting within my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I must, however, first observe that any major event is invariably preceded by a series of minor happenings, tremors and smoke puffs clearly indicative of the coming explosion, and that throughout the ages, the admirable efforts of a long succession of historians have all been flawed by their concentration upon major events to the near total disregard of the minor forewarnings in any developing situation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, in my master’s case, the vehemence of the rush of blood to his head increased with every minor brush with his tormentors, and that steady rise in pressure made the eventual eruption entirely pre-dictable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I am to properly convey the real extent of my wretched master’s sufferings, if I am to avoid the possibility that my readers should look down upon his rushes of blood to the head as trifling bubbles popping in his veins, if the world at large is not to sneer at his conduct as an exaggerated reaction to petty pin-pricks, surely I must not scamp the ordered details of the development of his frenzy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, when one considers what agony is involved in the generation of the most modest inspiration, it would be a discouragement to many a budding talent if any manifestation of wrong-way-upness should be disparaged.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, I must confess that the chain of incidents, minor and major, which I am about to relate reflects no honor upon Mr. Sneaze.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nonetheless, though the incidents themselves are, by and large, disgraceful, I must make it clear that the frenzy is no whit less genuine, less pure, than the flow of inspiration in the very greatest of the madmen of the arts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since my own old master has nothing else remarkable about him, were I not to laud his frenzy, I, his life’s recorder, would have nothing much to record.Our enemies who swarm all over the Hall of the Descending Cloud have recently invented a new sort of dumdum bullet which they mercilessly fire into the northern part of the open space not only during their ten-minute breaks between classes, but also after their school hours end.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This new dumdum is apparently called a ball and it is discharged at the foe by being struck with an object resembling a bloated pestle or rolling pin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, powerful as that weapon may be, the range from its point of discharge in the Hall’s playground to the study where my master is normally entrenched is too far for him to be in any personal danger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Our enemies are, of course, fully aware of the range problem and have accordingly developed a tactic which exploits the limitations of their weapon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I understand that the Japanese triumph at the battle of Port Arthur was due in no small part to the indirect gunfire of our Navy.Correspondingly, even a dumdum struck no further than into the open space must surely contribute something to the discomforture of my master; especially when, presumably as an expression of the solidarity of the swarm, every missile is accompanied by a loud and menacing cry of “Wow” uttered in unison from every hostile throat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You can imagine with what terror my master is overwhelmed, how pitifully contracted are the blood conduits to his arms and legs, and how inevitably, under the pressures of agony, all the blood at large within him begins to flow in the wrong direction upwards to his head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One must concede the artful ingenuity of those young schemers in the Hall.Long ago in Greece there lived a writer named Aeschylus whose head was of the kind common to all scholars and writers—that is to say, it was bald.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you should wonder why such persons should all lack head hair, the reason is that scholars and writers are usually poor (and therefore ill nourished) and that their work is all in the head (so that what little nourishment reaches their heads is all so rapidly there consumed that only a very small proportion of it survives to nourish the hair roots in their scalps).",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Writers and scholars are all characteristically both under-nourished and bald.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It follows that Aeschylus, being a writer, had no hair on his head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, he was renowned for his magnificently smooth pate, hairless as a kumquat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One day, with his usual head (I do not mean to imply that one can change heads as one changes hats, wearing at will a party head or an everyday head or a Sunday-go-to-meeting head, but simply that on this occasion the head of Aeschylus was as bald as ever), this famous writer went out walking in the streets, where he allowed the brilliant Grecian sunshine to be reflected from his scalp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which was a very bad mistake.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Bright light reflected from a smooth bald head can be seen from an enormous distance.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is the top of the tallest tree which takes the wind’s worst force, so the top of earth’s most shining man may well expect attentions no less fierce.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, it then so happened that an eagle with a captured tortoise clutched in its talons came cruising through the skies directly above the scintillating Aeschylus.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tortoises and turtles make delicious eating, but even in the days of the early Greeks they had already so far evolved as to be very hard-shelled creatures; shells so hard, however delicious the meat within, make it equally hard for meals to be made of tortoises or turtles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is perfectly true that lobsters grilled in the shell are a popular dish today, but no one’s ever heard of tortoise stewed in the carapace, and I doubt if they ever will.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Certainly no such item appeared on the menus of ancient Greece, and that cruising eagle was beginning, somewhat embarrassedly, to wonder what on earth he should do with his pendant tortoise when his eye was caught by a brilliant glittering from the distant earth below him.“I’ve got it,” thought the eagle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“If I drop this tortoise on that shiny thing, its shell must surely break, and, once the shell is broken, I can plummet down and gorge to my heart’s content on the so-unshielded meat.Nothing more simple.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Here we go!” And, aiming skillfully for the efful-gent center of the Aeschylean skull, he straightway dropped the tortoise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unfortunately, both for Aeschylus and for the disappointed eagle, the skulls of writers are softer than the carapace of a tortoise; so it was that, with his bright head smashed in smithereens, that luminary of literature came to his pitiful death.My readers may be wondering how this long digression into death from the sky relates to my master’s troubles, but I have reasonable hope that all in good time the connections will declare themselves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First, however, I feel bound to comment that I find it hard to determine the true intent of that eagle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Did he drop the tortoise in full awareness that the shiny object was the head of a writer, or did he genuinely believe his target was bare rock?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Depending on the way in which one interprets the bird’s intention, one either can or cannot draw a useful parallel between the eagle and those boy-faced harpies from the Hall.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Moreover, any attempt fully to understand the problem must take due account of a variety of conflicting factors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For instance, it is a matter of fact that my master is not bald, and consequently, his head, unlike those of Aeschylus and other distinguished writers and scholars, emits no brilliant light.However, he does possess (though it is a pitiably small example) that sine qua non of any writer or scholar, a study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In addition, though he is normally to be found asleep in front of it, he does actually spend much of his time with some difficult book propped up before his nose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One must accordingly regard him as a person of at least the scholarly type.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The fact that his head is not of a scholarly baldness does not necessarily mean that he is unqualified for such nudity: it could simply be that he is not yet fully unfledged.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, at his present rate of losing his wig, he can confidently expect to soon be as bald as any coot of a professor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If his depilation is the battle objective of those hooligans at the Hall, one must acknowledge that they would be acting shrewdly if they concentrated their dumdum fire on my master’s head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Two weeks of such bombardment would so terrify the man that his contracted veins would cease to nourish him properly and his head would quickly come to resemble a kumquat or a kettle or a bright, round, copper pot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Two further weeks of bombardment and the kumquat would be squashed, the kettle spring a leak, and the copper pot crack open.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Faced with such a battle plan, the only person who could fail to predict its inevitable success, the only fathead who would soldier on regardless, would be, of course, my madman of a master.There came an afternoon when, taking my usual snooze on the veranda, I dreamt I was a tiger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Bring me,” I growl at my master, “buckets brimming with chicken meat,” which he, crawling toward me in a pleasing tremble of terror, immediately supplied.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse then appeared and I promptly snarl, “Get yourself down to the Wild Goose Restaurant, for I want, and you shall fetch, goose flesh of the best.”“Pickled turnip and rice-crackers,” comes the expectable blather of Waverhouse response, “have a savor strikingly similar to that of the wild goose.”Not deigning even to comment on his presumptuous prevarication, I simply open wide my cavern of a mouth and shake him silly with a single shattering roar.Waverhouse turns pale and placatingly continues, “The Wild Goose Restaurant on Yamashita Street has, I much regret to report, just gone out of business.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What other fare, most honored sir, would you allow me to procure for you?”“Shut, is it?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, in that case I’ll let you off with beef.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t just stand there.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Be off to Westbrooks and hurry back here with a pound of the finest roasting beef.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hurry,” I said, “or I’ll gulp you where you stand.”Waverhouse shoots out of the house at the double, the back of his gown tucked up into his girdle to free his legs for a truly astonishing turn of speed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My enormous body sprawled at ease along the veranda, I am lying there waiting for the return of Waverhouse when, all of a sudden, a hideous shouting fills the house, and, without so much as a nibble of beef, I was jerked awake from my flesh-delicious dream.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For my master, who only a moment back had been prostrating himself before me in a cringe of juddering terror, came rocketing out of the lavatory, kicked me aside with a savage toe in the ribs and, before I even recovered from that shock, had slipped on his outdoor clogs, whizzed out through the garden gate and was off at his ungainliest gallop toward the Hall of the Descending Cloud.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is distinctly disconcerting to find oneself so quickly shrunken from a tiger to a cat, but I confess I was also somewhat tickled by this latest weird development.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, the combination of the sight of my master’s ferocious countenance with the pain of his vicious kick soon wiped from my mind all memory of tiger-time.My lightheartedness derives from the likelihood that, if my master is, at last, really going into action, there’ll be some fun when the sparks start flying.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So disregarding my aching ribs, I limp along in his wake and, as I come to the backyard gate, I hear him barking, “Thief!”Up ahead, just scrambling over the four-eye fence with his Hall school cap still stuck on his head, there’s a sturdy lad aged about eighteen or nineteen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As the intruder drops into safety and scampers off to his base camp in the playground, I sigh that he’s got away, but my master, encouraged by the success of his shout of “Thief,” shouts it once again and thunders on in hot pursuit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which brings him to the fence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he keeps on going, he too will trespass into thievery and, in his present transport of frenzy, it looks as though the passion of the chase and his own Dutch courage may actually carry him up and over the barricades.Certainly he shows no sign of wavering as his spindly legs bring him to the point where the bamboo stakes stand planted on the border.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One more climbing step and my normally craven master will have graduated into villainy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At that moment one of the enemy generals, some scurvy usher with a droopy thin moustache, moved up to the frontier, where he and my master, each on his own side of the fence, engaged in the following utterly fatuous parlay.“Yes, he is a student of the Hall.”“Then, like all good students, he should conduct himself correctly.How does he come to be trespassing on someone else’s premises?”“He was collecting a ball that had rolled onto your land.”“Why, then, did he not simply come and ask my permission to retrieve it?”“I will ensure that the boy is reproved.”“Well, in that case, all right.”The negotiations which I had happily anticipated developing into outright battle thus quickly petered out in a dull exchange of the prosiest kind of chicken chat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master’s fire-breathing threats are mere bravado.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When it comes to action, nothing ever happens.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s not unlike my own reversion from a dream tiger to an actual cat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, the foregoing happenings constitute that “minor incident” of which I wished to tell you, and I will now proceed to the tale of the major incident which followed.My master is lying flat on his belly in the living room with the sliding door left open.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is deep in thought, probably devising ways to defend himself against those hooligans at the Hall where, it would seem, classes must be in progress because no noise whatsoever is coming from the playground.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Instead, through the unwonted quiet comes a voice, which by its resonance I immediately recognize as the voice of the enemy general at yesterday’s conference, delivering a clear and closely reasoned lecture upon ethics.“Thus, public morality is so important that you will find it practiced everywhere: in Europe, in France, in Germany, in England, everywhere.Furthermore, everyone in Europe, even the most humble persons, pays deep respect to this public morality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is all the more regrettable that we, in Japan, are still unable to match the civilizations of foreign countries in this matter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Some of you may perhaps think that public morality is an unimportant concept newly imported from abroad, but if you do so think, you are mistaken.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Our own forebears were proud to be guided by the teachings of Confucius, which in every context emphasize the importance not only of faithfulness, but of true understanding of the needs of other beings; it is upon precisely such an understanding that public morality is founded.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since I am human, there are times when I feel like singing in a loud voice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if I were studying, and someone in the next room started singing loudly, I’d find it impossible to concentrate on my reading.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Therefore, even though I would like to refresh my mind by quoting aloud from some anthology of classical Chinese poetry, I restrain myself from doing so because I know how infuriating I would find such a disturbance of my own studies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In brief, your own national tradition of public morality must always be observed and you should never do things which might be a nuisance to others.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”At that point my master, who had been listening carefully to the lecture, broke into so broad a grin that I feel I must explain the inwardness of his reaction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A cynical reader might well suspect some element of sarcasm in my master’s grinning, but the reality is that his nature is too simple, even too sweet, to accommodate the sour subtleties of doubt.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He simply does not have the brainpower to be bad.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He grinned for no more complicated reason than that he was pleased by what he’d heard, and, in his pitiful simplicity, he genuinely believed that since the ethics teacher had given such a poignant exhortation to the students, the hail of dumdums would now cease and he could snooze along forever in the recovered safety of his study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He need not yet, he reasoned, lose his hair.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His frenzies may not instantly be cured, but, with the passing of the days, their violence will abate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He can dispense with wet towels around his brows and a charcoal-burner for his feet.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And he need not sleep with a tree for his only shelter and a stone beneath his bum.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Cozy in such delusions, of course the fathead grinned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is in the not unworthy nature of the man that my master should have taken that lecture seriously.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, though he lives in the twentieth century, he still quite honestly believes even that debts should be repaid.In due time the school’s class hours must have ended, for the lecture on ethics came to a sudden stop.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I assume all the other classes finished at the same time, for quite suddenly, with hideous whoops and shouts, some eight hundred young gentlemen came tumbling out of the building.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Buzzing and whirring like a swarm of bees whose hive has been knocked over, they poured from the windows, doorways, and indeed from every least gap in the fabric of the school.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And it was with that eruption that the major incident began.Let me begin with an account of the battle formation of these human bees; should you think it overblown to use specialized military terms to describe such a piffling business as my master’s scufflings with mere schoolboys, well, you’d be quite wrong.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When ordinary people think of warfare, their idea of battle is of such bitter encounters as those which took place during our recent war with Russia at Shaka, Mukden and Port Arthur.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Less ordinary persons, notably those barbarians who have some feel for poetry, associate warfare with particular colorful incidents or feats of derring-do: with Achilles in his chariot dragging the corpse of Hector around the walls of Troy, or with Chang Fei of Yen standing alone with his four-yard, snake-shaped halberd on the Ch’ang-pan Bridge and glaring down the milling hordes of Ts’ao Ts’ao’s army.However, though every man is perfectly entitled to fashion his individual notion of the nature of warfare, it would be outrageous to lay down that the only real wars are those of the kinds to which I’ve just referred.One would like to think that totally foolish wars only took place in antiquity and that today, in the capital city of Imperial Japan and during a period of peace, such barbaric behavior were inconceivable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even though riots do occasionally occur, there’s no real danger of the disorder going beyond the burning of a few police boxes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Against that background there can be no doubt that the battle between Mr. Sneaze, Captain General of the Cave of the Sleeping Dragon, and the eight hundred stalwart youths from the Hall of the Descending Cloud must be recognized as one of the most important conflicts fought out in Tokyo since the foundation of that city.Tso Shih’s account of the battle of Yen Ling opens with a description of the enemy’s forces and their disposition; since all subsequent historians of any repute have followed his example, I see no reason not to begin with a description of the battle formation of the Bees.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the van, disposed in line close against their own side of the four-eye fence, there is an advance guard of students whose probable function is to lure my master forward into artillery range.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“D’you think the old nut knows when he’s beaten?” “Too much of a fool.” “Hasn’t the guts to come against us.”“Where’s he skulking now?” “You’d think he had enough of his stinking loo.” “Not him.” “Maybe he’s stuck there.” “Silly old twerp.” “Let’s try barking.” “Bow-wow-wow.” “Yap-yap-yap.” “Bow-wow-wow.”These educated observations culminated in a long yowling war cry of derision from the whole detachment.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Stationed slightly apart to the right and rear of the advance unit in the general direction of the playground, a bat-tery of artillery has taken up a commanding position on a bump of higher ground.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The chief gunner, armed with an enormous rolling pin, stands facing toward the Dragon’s den; a second officer, with his back to the den, faces his colleague at a distance at some forty feet; and directly behind the bludgeon-bearer, similarly facing toward both the den and the second officer, a third artillery man crouches like a frog.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I have been told that persons so aligned are not necessarily preparing for battle and are probably practicing a game newly imported from America which is called baseball.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being myself an ignorant creature, I know nothing whatsoever about that game, but it is said to have become the most popular of all sporting activities in the middle schools, high schools and universities of modern Japan.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
America has a peculiar bent for the invention of fantastic things and I suppose it was only in kindness of heart that she taught Japan a game which can so easily be mistaken for gunnery and which causes so much annoyance in an otherwise peaceful neighborhood.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I imagine the Americans honestly think their game is no more than that; however, even the most gamesome game, if it is able to disrupt an entire neighborhood, can hardly avoid being regarded as bombardment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In my view the lads at the Hall schemed for the results of bombardment under the guise of good clean fun.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The truth is that by the infinite flexibility of interpretation one can get away with anything.Some people perpetrate fraud in the name of charity, others justify their obvious lunacy by calling it inspiration.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Could it not be that others practice warfare in the guise of baseball?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Baseball as I’ve hitherto described it is the normal form of the game, but the variety which I’ll now describe is nothing less than the gunnery aspects of siege warfare.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I shall commence with an account of the gunnery drill for firing dumdums.The second officer in the three-man crew that I’ve already described takes a dumdum in his right hand and slings it straight at the bludgeoneer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"None but the initiated know the precise contents of the dumdum, so, as a non-professional, I can only say that the missile is round and hard like a stony dumpling and that its contents are extremely carefully sewn tight within a leather casing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I was saying, this dumdum comes whistling through the wind toward the bludgeoneer who, brandishing his rolling pin, slams the missile back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Every so often there is a misfire when bludgeon and dumdum fail to connect and the frog-like figure is then supposed to stop the ball and toss it back for the first officer again to start the firing procedure.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, in most cases the connection is achieved, and, with a savage cracking sound, the dumdum is discharged.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The force thus generated is truly enormous and the kinetic energy stored in the missile could easily smash the thin skull of a neurotic dyspetic like my master.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The main three-man gun crew is all that is fundamentally necessary for the weapon to go into action, but the master gunners are supported by droves of reinforcements who stand around the gunsite and, whenever the crack of pestle on sturdy dumpling reports a successful firing, burst into a chorus of raucous shouts and a rapid fire of hand claps.“Strike,” they bellow.“A real home-slam.”“Had enough yet?”“We’ve got you licked.”“Go, go, go!”“Get on back, you fool!”Such a tempest of insults to my master would be bad enough, but injury is added to that offensiveness by the fact that, out of every three struck dumdums, at least one rolls onto the dragon’s land.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And that penetration is not accidental.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the contrary, it is the entire reason for the use of the baseball weapon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The weapon’s bullets are nowadays manufactured all over the world, but they still remain extremely expensive, so that even in times of war, their supply is limited.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Normally each artillery unit is provisioned with no more than one or two dumdums, and they cannot afford to lose their precious missile every time it’s fired.These units consequently always include a platoon of ball pickers, whose sole duty is to retrieve fallen balls.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That duty is relatively easy when the dumdums happen to fall in plain view on accessible ground, but when they land in long grass or on hostile territory, the platoon has an unen-viable task demanding speed, ingenuity, and often a willingness to face real danger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is thus the gunners’ normal tactic to aim the weapon in such a way that its projectile can be readily recovered, but, in the present context, their usual practice is deliberately reversed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They are no longer playing a game: they are engaged in warfare.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They aim to fire their dumdum into my master’s property so as to provide an excuse, the need to retrieve it, for crossing the four-eye fence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The constant irritation of dumdums landing in his property, immediately to be followed by hordes of howling schoolboys, leaves my master with a hideous choice between unventable anger and that resignation to fate which is surrender.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Under such strain his baldness, surely, can only be a matter of time.Then it was that a particularly well-struck dumdum came whistling over the four-eye fence, slashed off a few leaves from the lower branches of a paulownia, and, with tremendous noise, landed full-toss against our inner castle wall; that is to say, against that bamboo fence around our garden which I use for my exercises.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We know from Newton’s First Law of Motion that a body remains in its state of rest or of uniform motion unless acted upon by some external force.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If the movement of matter were governed only by that law, my master’s skull would at this very moment be sharing the fate of Aeschylus, so he was fortunate that Newton was kind enough to save him from such a shattering experience by the establishment of a Second Law to the effect that change in motion is proportional to, and in the same direction as, the applied force.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This, I’m afraid, is all a bit too difficult to follow, but the fact that the dumdum failed to pierce our garden fence, failed to rip on through our paper-window, and failed to smash my master’s skull must, with our deepest gratitude, be attributed to Newton.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In next to no time, as was only to be expected, the intrepid ball pickers were in action on our property.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One could hear them thrashing about with sticks in the clumps of bamboo grass to the accompaniment of such screeched comment as, “it landed about here” and “rather more to the left.” All enemy penetrations of the frontier in hot pursuit of their dumdums are conducted with maximum noise, since to sneak in for a secret retrieval would be to fail in their real mission.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, of course, important to recover a costly missile, but it is even more important to tease my master into frenzy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, on this particular occasion the ball pickers knew perfectly well where to look for their ball.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They’d seen its original line of flight, they’d heard it smack against our garden fence, and, therefore knowing the point of impact, they also knew precisely where it must have dropped to the ground; so it need have been no trouble at all to pick it up quietly and to depart in peace.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We are indebted to Leibuiz for the observation that any form of coexistence depends upon the mainte-nance of formal order.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, the letters of the alphabet, like the symbols of a syllabary, must always, in accordance with his Law of Systematic Order, occur in the same sequential relationship.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Similarly, the relationships established by convention, proverb and received wisdom should not be disturbed: good luck demands that under a willow tree there should always be a loach, while a bat and the evening moon are necessarily linked.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There is no such obvious connection between a ball and a fence, but persons who have accustomed themselves by daily baseball practice to regular inroads into our property do acquire a sense of order in such a relationship, from which it follows that they always know exactly where to spot their fallen dumdums.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It further follows that, since Leibuiz has told them where to look, their unwillingness to do so clearly shows that the fuss they make is directed not toward finding their ball but to provoking my master into warfare.Things have now gone so far that even a man as mild and as naturally sluggish as my master cannot fail to respond to the challenge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can it only have been yesterday that this suddenly berserk man of action was grinning so amiably to himself as he eavesdropped upon ethics?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Swept to his feet by pure rage, he ran out roaring from the house, and so savagely sudden was his counter-attack that he actually took a prisoner.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One cannot deny the brilliance, for my master, of this feat, but a beardless little lad of fourteen, maybe fifteen, summers makes a captive unbecoming to a fully whiskered man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unbecoming or not, it was good enough for my master as, despite its pitiful pleas for mercy and forgiveness, he dragged the wretched child into his very den and onto the veranda.At this point I should perhaps offer some further clarification of the enemy’s tactics.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They had in fact deduced from my master’s ferocious behavior on the previous day that he was now close to the breaking point and that it was a near certainty that today he could easily be needled into another lunatic charge.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If such a sally led to the capture of some laggard senior boy, there would obviously be trouble.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But they calculated that the risk of trouble would be minimized to virtually nothing if they used as ball pickers only the smallest of their first- and second-year juniors.If my master succeeded in catching such a minnow and then kicked up a whale of a fuss, he would merely succeed in disgracing himself for childish behavior, and no reflection whatsoever would be cast upon the honor of the Hall.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such were the calculations of the enemy and such would be the calculations of any normal person; however their planning failed to take account of the fact that they were not dealing with an ordinary human being, and they should have realized from his extraordinary performance yesterday that my master lacks the common sense to see anything ludicrous in a full grown man pitting himself against some squitty little schoolboy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A rush of blood to the head will lift a normal person into flights of abnormality and transmute level headed creatures into raving loonies; so long as a victim of frenzy remains capable of distinguishing between women, children, packhorse drivers and rickshawmen, his frenzy remains a paltry possession.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"True frenzy, the divine afflatus, demands that its possessed possessor should, like my frenzied master, be capable of capturing alive some snotty, little schoolchild and of keeping him close as a prisoner of real war.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The capture has been made.The trembling captive had been ordered forth to pick up balls like a common soldier ordered into battle by his senior officers, only to be cornered by the inspired battlecraft of a mad opposing general.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Cut off from escape home across the frontier, he is caught and held in durance vile on the garden veranda of his captor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In such circumstances, my master’s enemies cannot just sit back and watch their friend’s disgrace.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One after another, they come storming back over the four-eye fence and through the garden gate until some dozen doughties are lined up in front of my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Most of them are wearing neither jacket nor vest.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One, standing with his white shirt-sleeves rolled up above his elbows, folds defiant arms.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Another carries a worn-out cotton-flannel shirt slung across one shoulder.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In striking contrast, yet another, a right young dandy, wears a spotless shirt of whitest linen hem-piped in black with its owner’s initials in tasteful matching black embroidered as large capital letters above his heaving chest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every member of the detachment holds himself like a soldier, and, from the tanned darkness of their sturdy bulge of muscle, one might guess them to have arrived no later than last night from the rough, warrior-breeding uplands of the Sasayama mountains.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It seems a shame to waste such splendid material on a middle school education.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What an asset to the nation they could be as fishermen or boatmen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They were all barefooted with their trouser ends tucked high, as though interrupted on their way to fight some fire in the neighborhood.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Lined up in front of my master, they glared at him in silence, and he, equally silent, glared belligerently back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Through what seemed hours of steadily increasing tension their eyes remained locked and the atmosphere built up toward a pressure only to be relieved by the letting of blood.“Are you,” suddenly snarled my master with truly draconian violence, “also thieves?” His fury, like a blast of flame, vented itself from nostrils flared back from the sear of passion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The nose of the lion mask used in lion dances must have been modeled from an angered human face, for I can think of nowhere else where one could find so vicious an image of the mindless savagery of anger.“No, we are not thieves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We are students of the Hall of the Descending Cloud.”“Not just thieves but liars too!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How could students of that school you mention break into someone else’s garden without permission?”“But you can see the school badge on the caps we’re wearing.”“Those could be stolen, too.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you are what you claim to be, explain how pupils at such a respectable school could be such thieves, such liars, such disgusting trespassers?”“We only came to get our ball.”“Why did you allow the ball to come upon my property?”“It just did.”“What a disgraceful lot you are.”“We shall be more careful in future.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Please forgive us this time.”“Why on earth should I forgive a gang of young hooligans, all complete strangers, who come rampaging over fences to muck about on my property?”“But we really are students of the Hall.”“If you are indeed students, in what grade are you?”“The third year.”“Are you certain of that?”“Yes.”My master turned his head toward the house and shouted for the maid, and almost immediately, with a questioning, “Yes?” that idiot Osan stuck her head out of the door.“Go over to the Hall of the Descending Cloud and fetch someone.”“Whom shall I fetch?”“Anyone, but get him here.”Though O-san acknowledged these instructions, the scene in the garden was so odd, the meaning of my master’s orders so insufficiently clear, and the general conduct of the matter so inherently silly that, instead of setting off for the school, she simply stood there with a half-baked grin on her face.We must remember, however, that my master thinks he is directing a major war operation in which his inspired genius is in fullest flower.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He naturally expects that his own staff should be flat out in his support and is far from pleased when some menial orderly not only seems blissfully unaware of the seriousness of warfare but, infinitely worse, reacts to action orders with a vacuous grin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Inevitably his frenzy mounts.“I’m telling you to fetch someone from the Hall, anyone, no matter who.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can’t you understand?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One of the teachers, the school secretary, the headmaster, anybody.”“You mean the schoolmaster?” In respect of school matters that oaf O-san knows nothing of hierarchy and no school title save schoolmaster.“Yes, any of the schoolmasters, or the secretary, or the head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Can’t you hear what I’m saying?”“If none of those are there, how about the porter?”“Don’t be such a fool.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How could a porter cope with serious matters?”At this point, O-san, probably thinking there was nothing more she could usefully do on the veranda, just said, “Right,” and withdrew.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quite plainly she hadn’t the foggiest idea of the purpose of her mission, and, while I was pondering the likelihood of her returning with the porter, I was surprised to see the lecturer on ethics come marching in by the front-gate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

It’s left a nasty taste in my mouth.”“I quite understand.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Vainglory such as his is positively sickening.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He should see himself and his social status realistically; but no, stupid and stuck-up, he carries on like the lord of all creation.”“That’s just it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His insolent disparagement of the business community gets my goat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All that rant about never bowing to the might of money.So I thought I’d let him see what a businessman can do.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For quite some time now I’ve been putting spokes in his wagon, modest irritations involving no more than modest expenditure, but the man’s incredibly stubborn and I find myself stumped by his sheer block-headedness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He can’t, apparently, grasp that he’s being got at.”“The trouble is that he has no real understanding of profit and loss.He is incapable of appreciating, let alone weighing, the balance of his own advantage and disadvantage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So he goes his own mad road, feeble but persistent in resisting redirection, totally oblivious to his own best interest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s always been like that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A hopeless case.”Goldfield burst into genuine laughter at the portrait drawn by Suzuki of a character so ludicrous to them both that cachinnation was their only possible reaction.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“You’ve hit the nail on the head.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve tried all sorts of tricks to shake him up.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Knowing the level of his intelligence, I’ve even hired schoolkids to play him up with pranks.”“That was a bright idea!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Did it work?”“I think it’s working.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Certainly it’s put him under strain, and I fancy it’s now only a matter of time before he cracks under the pressure.”“Under sheer weight of numbers!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How clever you are.”“Yes, I think that he’s beginning to feel the effects of his singularity.Anyway, he’s pretty weakened and I want you to go along and see how he is.”“Gladly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ll call on him right away and let you have a report on my way back.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This should be interesting.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It must be quite a sight to see that bull-headed fellow down in the dumps.”“Very well, then.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
See you later.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ll be expecting you.”“All right, Sir.”Well, well!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So here we are again with another pretty plot.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The power of a businessman is indeed formidable.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By its frightening force my clink-er of a master has been set afire with frenzy; his thatch of hair is well on its agonized way to becoming a skating rink for flies, and his skull can soon expect an Aeschylean bashing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Considering how much has been achieved by the power of a single businessman, I am obliged to conclude that, though I’ll never know why the earth spins around on its axis, it’s certainly cash that motivates this world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
None know better than businessmen what power money buys.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is by their nod that the sun comes up in the east and, by their decision, goes down in the west.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have been very slow to learn the divine right of businessmen, and I attribute my backwardness to the atmosphere, the cultural effluvia from a poor pigheaded schoolie, in which I have been reared.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The time has clearly come when my dimwitted bigot of a master simply must wake up to the realities of this world.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To persevere in his present attitudes could well prove dangerous; dangerous, even, to that dreary, dull, dyspeptic life which he so desperately treasures.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How, I wonder, will my master cope with the coming visitation of Suzuki?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Believing that the style in which that visitor is received will be an accurate indicator of the degree to which my master has learnt to recognize and accept the power of businessmen, I know I must not loiter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though merely a cat, I accept the imperatives of loyalty and am worried for my master’s safety.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I slink around the nauseating Suzuki and, at a scamper, got back home before him.Suzuki proves as smooth and slippery as ever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No mention of the Goldfields soils his subtle lips, but he chats away, amused and even amusing, on matters of no importance.“You don’t look too well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is anything wrong?”“No, I’m quite well.”“But you’re pale.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Must take care of yourself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The weather’s not been good.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Are you sleeping all right?”“Yes.”“Perhaps you have some worry.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If there’s anything I can do, just tell me.”“Worry?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What worry?”“Oh, if you’re so lucky as to be quite worry-free, that’s fine.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I only spoke of worry in the hope that I might help.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Worry, you know, is the worst of poisons.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s much more profitable to live one’s life with gaiety and laughter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You seem to me a bit depressed, gloomy even.”“Laughter’s no joke, sometimes positively harmful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Men have died from too much laughter.”“Nonsense.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Remember the saying that luck arrives through a merry gate.”“It sounds to me as though you’ve never heard of Chrysippus.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Have you?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
An ancient Greek philosopher?”“Never heard of him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What did he do?”“He died of laughter.”“Really?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How extraordinary!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But that was long ago.”“What difference does that make?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Chrysippus saw a donkey eating figs from a silver bowl and thought the sight so funny he laughed and laughed and couldn’t stop laughing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Eventually he laughed himself to death.”“Well, that’s certainly a very funny story, but I’m not suggesting you should laugh your life away.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But laugh a little, moderately, a little more than you do, and you’ll find you feel wonderful.”Suzuki was watching my master through intently narrowed eyes, but his concentration was broken by the noise of the front gate opening.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I thought, with pleased relief that one of my master’s friends had chosen this happy moment to drop in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But I was wrong.“Our ball’s come in.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"May I go and get it?”O-san answered from the kitchen, “Yes, you may,” and the schoolboy pads around to the back garden.Suzuki distinctly puzzled, asks, “What was all that about?”“The boys from the school next door have batted one of their balls into my garden.”“Schoolboys next door?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Do you have schoolboys for neighbors?”“There’s a school out back, the Hall of the Descending Cloud.”“Oh, I see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A school.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It must be very noisy.”“You’ve no idea how noisy it is.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I can’t even study.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I were the Minister of Education, I’d order it closed forthwith.”Suzuki permitted himself a burst of laughter sufficiently long to increase my master’s irritation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“My goodness,” he observed when his cackling ceased, “you really are worked up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Do the schoolboys bother you all that much?”“Bother me!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They certainly do!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They bother me from morning until night.”“If you find it all so irritating, why don’t you move away?”“You dare suggest that I should move away!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What impertinence!”“Steady on, now.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s no point in getting angry with me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, they’re only little boys.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I were you, I’d simply disregard them.”“Yes, I expect you would; but I wouldn’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only yesterday I summoned one of the teachers here and lodged a formal complaint.”“What a lark!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He must have been ashamed.”“He was.”Just then, we heard again a voice and the sound of the front door opening.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Our ball’s rolled in.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"May I please go and fetch it.”“Golly,” said Suzuki, “not another with another lost ball.”“Yes, I’ve agreed that they should come by the front gate.”“I see, I see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They do keep coming, don’t they?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One after the other!I’ve got it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yes, I see.”“What is it that you see?”“Oh, I meant I see the reason for this stream of schoolboys coming to collect lost balls,”“That’s the sixteenth time today.”“Don’t you find it a nuisance?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Why don’t you keep them out?”“Keep them out?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How can I keep them out when their ball keeps flying in?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They’d come in anyway.”“Well, if you say you can’t help it, I suppose you can’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But why get so tense and stiff-necked about it?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A man with jagged edges is permanently handicapped: he can never roll smoothly along in this rough world.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anything rounded and easy going can easily go anywhere, but angular things not only find it hard to roll but, when they do roll, get their corners snagged and chipped and blunted, which hurts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You see, old chap, the world’s not made simply and solely for you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You can’t always have things your way.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In a nutshell, it doesn’t pay to defy the wealthy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All you’ll achieve are strained nerves, damaged health, and an ill name from everyone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whatever you do and however much you suffer, those with money won’t care a damn.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All they have to do is to sit back and hire others to work for them, including whatever dirty work they happen to want done.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s obvious that you can’t stand up to people like that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Dogged adherence to high moral principle is all very well in its way, but it seems to me that the price you might have to pay, indeed the price you are apparently paying, is a total disruption of both your private studies and your daily employment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’ll finish up completely worn out for no gain whatsoever.”“Excuse me, but another ball’s come in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"May I go around to the back and get it?”“Look,” said Suzuki with a knowing laugh, “here they are again.”“The impudent brats,” my master shouted from a face stung red with rage.The purpose of his mission now achieved, Suzuki made polite excuses and, as he left the house, invited my master to call upon him sometime.No sooner had Suzuki gone but we had another visitor, the family physician, Dr. Amaki.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The record of history since the most ancient times shows very few persons describing themselves as frenzied, and it’s obvious that when they can recognize themselves as a bit odd, they’ve passed the peak of their derangement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master reached and passed that peak during yesterday’s major incident, and, though he started off all flame and fury only to settle down in dust and ashes, the fact remains that he did achieve a settlement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yesterday evening, as he ruminated over the business of that busy day, he recognized there had been something odd about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whether the oddness lay with himself or with the inmates of the Hall—that, naturally, remained in doubt.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But there was no doubt at all that something very odd was going on.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the course of his rumina-tions, he even realized that, despite the constant provocation that having a middle school for a neighbor must inevitably generate, it was nevertheless a bit peculiar to have lost his temper, to have been dispossessed of his self-possession, day in day out, for weeks on end.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
If the oddity lay in himself something must be done about it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But what, he wondered, what?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In the end he concluded he had no choice but to seek some drug or medicine which would suppress or tranquilize his irritation at its internal source.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having reasoned thus far, my master decided that he’d call in Dr. Amaki and ask for a physical checkup.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We need not concern ourselves with the wisdom or folly of that decision, but my master’s determination to cope with his frenzy once he’d noticed it commands, unquestionably, respect and praise.Dr.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Amaki is his usual smiling self as he serenely asks, “And how are we today ?” Most physicians ask that curious question in the plural, and I wouldn’t trust a doctor who didn’t.“Doctor, I’m sure my end is near.”“What?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nonsense.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That’s impossible.”“Tell me frankly, do doctors’ medicines ever do one good?”Dr.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Amaki was naturally taken aback by the form of that question but, being a man of courteous disposition, he answered gently without showing any annoyance: “Medicines usually do some good.”“Take my stomach trouble for instance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No amount of medicine produces the least improvement.”“That’s not quite true.”“No?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Do you think my medicine is making me feel better?” He’s off again about his blessed stomach, inviting external opinions on an internal condition about which his nervous system sends him regular on-site reports.“Well,” says the doctor, “no cure comes in the twinkling of an eye.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
These things take time.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But you’re already better now than you used to be.”“Really?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Do you think so?”“Are you still easily irritated?”“Of course I am.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I fly off the handle even in my dreams.”“Perhaps you’d better take more exercise.”“If I do that, I’ll lose my temper yet more quickly.”Dr.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Amaki must have felt exasperated, for he said, “Let’s take a look at you,” and began examining my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As soon as the examination was over, my master suddenly asked in a very loud voice, “Doctor, the other day I was reading a book about hypnotism which claimed that all sorts of ailments, including kleptomania and other strange disorders, respond well to hypnotic treatment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Do yon think it’s true?”“Yes, that treatment has been known to effect cures.”“Is it still practiced today?”“Yes.”“Is it difficult to hypnotize a person?”“No, quite easy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I often do it.”“What?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You do it?”“Yes, shall I try it on you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyone can be hypnotized, at least in theory.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Would you like me to try?”“Very interesting!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yes, please do try.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve always wanted to be hypnotized, but I wouldn’t care to remain in a permanent trance, never to wake up.”“You needn’t worry about that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Right then, shall we start?”Knowing my master, I was surprised at the speed with which he had agreed to this somewhat unusual form of treatment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve never seen a hypnotist in action, so, thrilled by this exciting chance to witness a wonder for myself, I settled to watch from a corner of the room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Dr. Amaki began by stroking my master’s upper eyelids in a downward direction.Though my master kept his eyes shut tight, the doctor continued his downward stroking as though endeavoring to close the lids.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After a while, the doctor asks, “As I stroke your eyelids down, like this, you feel the eyes are getting heavy, don’t you?”“True, they are becoming heavy,” answers my master.The doctor continues stroking and stroking, and eventually says,“Heavier and heavier, your eyes feel heavier and heavier, you feel that heaviness, don’t you?”My master, no doubt feeling just as the doctor suggests, is silent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The stroking continues for a further three or four minutes, and then the doctor murmurs, “Now you can’t open your eyes.”My wretched master!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Blinded by his own physician!“You mean my eyes won’t open.”“That’s right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You can’t open them.”My master, his eyes closed, makes no reply.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And I watch this fearful scene in the compassionate conviction that he has now become blind.After a while the doctor says, “Just try to open them—I bet you can’t.”“No,” replies my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No sooner had he spoken than both his eyes pop open, and, with a happy smirk, he comments, “You didn’t do me, did you?”“No,” says Dr. Amaki, laughing in reply, “it seems I couldn’t.” So the experiment with hypnotic healing proved a flop, and Dr. Amaki left on some other mission of medical mercy.Soon another visitor arrived.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since my master has very few friends, it’s almost unbelievable that so many of those he has should choose to call today: indeed, I’ve never known such numbers visit in the space of a single day.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Still, there it is.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The visitors did come, and this particular visitor was a very rare specimen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I hasten to clarify that I shall be writing about him at some length not because of his rarity but because he has a significant part to play in that promised aftermath which I am still in process of describing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I do not know the man’s name, but he looks about forty and sports a smart goatee on his long face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as I think of Waverhouse as an aesthete, I see this new arrival as a philosopher.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s not that he’s laid any kind of claim to philosophic status or blown his own trumpet in the Waverhouse style, but simply that, as he talks to my master, he looks to me as a philosopher should look.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I deduce that he must be another of my master’s school mates, for they speak to each other in the familiar manner of very close old friends.“You mentioned Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now there’s an extraordinary man, as light and flossy as goldfish food floating around on a pond.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t you agree?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Someone was telling me that only the other day he went out walking with a friend and, as they passed the gates of some peer or other, no one of course whom Waverhouse had ever met, he dragged his companion right into the house on the grounds that it would be pleasant to call on the owner and take a dish of tea.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He really is the giddy limit!”“And what happened?”“I didn’t bother to find out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Something eccentric, I’ve no doubt.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The man was born that way, not a thought in his head; unadulterated goldfish food.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And Suzuki?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You see him here?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That one’s clever all right, but not a man of the mind, not the kind I’d have thought you’d care to have around.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s the type to whom money and a gold watch seem to gravitate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Worldly wise but ultimately worthless.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A shallow man, and restless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s always talking about the importance of smooth-ness, of doing things smoothly, smoothing one’s way through life.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But he understands nothing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nothing at all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not even the meaning of smooth-ness.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If Waverhouse is goldfish food, Suzuki’s common jelly paste: a thing unpleasantly smooth which shakes and trembles, a thing fit only to be strung on straw, available for sale to any passerby.”My master seems to be much impressed by this flow of denigrating simile for, which he rarely does, he broke into hearty laughter and enquires, “That’s Waverhouse and Suzuki.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now what about you?”“Me?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, maybe I’m a yam—long in shape and buried in mud.”“At least you seem carefree, always so self-controlled and self-composed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How I envy you.”“But I’m much the same as anyone else.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s nothing about me particularly to be envied.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Still, I have the luck not to envy anyone.Which is just about the only good thing about me.”“Financially, are you now well off?”“No, the same as ever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Little enough, but just sufficient to eat, so there’s nothing to worry about.”“Myself, I feel so deeply discontented that I’m always losing my temper.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I grouse and grumble and hardly anything else.”“There’s nothing wrong with grumbling.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When you feel like grumbling, grumble away.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
At least it brings one interim relief.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You see, everyone is different.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You can’t refashion others to be like you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consider chopsticks and bread: you’ve got to hold chopsticks as everyone does or you’ll find it hard to eat rice; however, bread can be cut, and is best cut, in accordance with your own particular liking.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A suit made by a good tailor fits like a glove from the moment you put it on, but something run up by a shoddy craftsman takes years of tiresome wearing before it adjusts itself to your own particular bone structure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If competent parents produced children all neatly shaped to fit the ways of our present world, all would be happily well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if you have the misfortune to be born bungled, your only choice is either to suffer as a misfit or to hang on grimly until the world so changes its shape as to suit yours.”“I see no prospect that I shall ever fit in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s a depressing prospect.”“If one forces one’s way into a suit too small for one’s body, of course one tears the stitchings, by which I mean that persons violently ill suited to the world they seek to inhabit are those who pick quarrels, commit suicide, even incite real riots.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But you, to be frank, are merely discontented.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’re not going to do yourself in and you’re not a natural brawler.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You could be a lot worse off than you are.”“On the contrary, I find I’m picking quarrels morning, noon, and night.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I lack a subject on whom to vent my spleen, I live in a constant fume of anger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even such undirected ire amounts to brawling, doesn’t it?”“I see, you brawl with yourself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Interesting.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But what’s wrong with that?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Brawl away to your heart’s content.”“But I’ve grown bored with brawling.”“Then just stop it.”“I understand what you’re driving at, but whatever you may say, one cannot do what one likes with one’s own mind.”“My point is that one can.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But leaving that aside, what do you think is the root cause of your self-wounding discontent?”In response to that sympathetic invitation, my master poured out before his friend the long sad catalogue of his woes and grievances.Beginning with an account of his war with the schoolboys, he proceeded to list, in manic detail and a neatly ordered, reverse chronology, every single fretfulness, right back to the days of the terracotta badger, Savage Tea, and his petty provocations by conniving colleagues on the staff of his own school.The visiting philosopher listened in complete silence, but, allowing a long pause after Mr. Sneaze had finished his jeremiad to add its weight to his response, offered the following sagacities.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“You should pay no regard whatsoever to the things said by your staff colleagues, which were anyway all complete rubbish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The schoolkids from the Hall are not to be taken seriously, grubby little vermin, existences not worthy even to be noticed by a man at your level of intellectual attainment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What?You insist that they disturb you?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tell me then, have your demeaning counter-activities, even your formal complaint, even that so-called settlement of the matter led to any lessening of disturbance?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In all such matters I believe that the ways of our ancestors are wiser and much more effective than the ways of Europe, that so-called positivism which has lately attracted so much faddish attention.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The main snag with positivism is that it acknowledges no limits.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However long you may persist in positive action, the craving for ultimate satisfaction remains unsatisfied, the quest for the ideal eternally unrealized.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You see those cypresses over there?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let us suppose you decide that they obstruct your view and you clear them away.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then you’ll find the boarding house behind them has become a new interruption of your view.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When you’ve eliminated the boarding house, the next building beyond begins to niggle you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s no end to your search for a perfect view, and your ultimate dissatisfaction is the fate implicit in the European hankering for incessant progress toward an imagined ideal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nobody at all, not even Alexander the Great or Napoleon, has ever felt satisfied with his con-quests.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Take a more homespun case.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You meet a man, you take a scunner to him, you get into a quarrel, you fail to squash him, you take him to court, you win your case: but if you imagine that that’s an end to the matter, you’re most lamentably mistaken.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For the real issue, the problem in your mind, remains unsettled, however hard you wrestle it around, until your dying day.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The same truth applies in every context you may care to posit.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You happen, perhaps, to live under an oligarchic government which you dislike so much that you replace it with a parlia-mentary democracy, but, finding you’ve only hopped out of a frying pan into a fire, you run the risks of civil commotion merely to find another, no less searing, form of government.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Or you find a river troublesome, so you bridge it; you are blocked by a mountain, so you tunnel through; it’s a bore to walk or ride, so you build a railway.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On and on it goes, with no solution solving the real problem of a positivist’s dissatisfaction.Surely it’s obvious that no human individual can ever have the whole of his heart’s desire.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The progressive positivism of Western civilization has certainly produced some notable results, but, in the end, it is no more than a civilization of the inherently dissatisfied, a culture for unhappy peoples.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The traditional civilization of Japan does not look for satisfaction by some change in the condition of others but in that of the self.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The main difference between the West and Japan is that the latter civilization has developed on the basic assumption that one’s external environment cannot be significantly changed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If father and son cannot get along together, Westerners seek to establish domestic peace and quiet by changing the parent-child relationship, whereas we in Japan accept that relationship as immutable and strive, within that fixed relationship, to find a workable pattern for the restoration of domestic harmony.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We take the same attitude toward any difficulties that may arise in such other fixed relationships as those between husband and wife, between master and servant, between the merchant and the warrior classes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We hold our attitude to be consonant with, indeed a reflection of, nature itself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If some mountain range blocks our free passage to a neighboring country, we do not seek to flatten the mountain, to restructure the natural order.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Instead we work out some arrangement under which the need to visit that neighboring country no longer arises.“This method of fostering happiness, whereunder a man becomes perfectly content not to cross mountains, is perhaps best understood by Confucianists and Buddhists of the Zen sects.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nobody, however mighty, can do as he likes with the world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"None can stop the sun from setting, none reverse the flow of rivers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But any man is able to do as he likes with his own mind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, if you are prepared to undergo the disciplines that lead to control of the mind, indeed to its ultimate liberation, you would never even hear the racket kicked up by those graceless imps at the Hall; you would care no whit to be called a terracotta badger; and, knowing your fellow teachers for mere fools, you would smile your disconcern upon their pitiful pavinities.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As an example of the efficacy of the course of conduct I suggest, may I remind you of the story of the Zen priest Sogan who, in the turbulent times of thirteenth-century China, was threatened with decapitation by some berserk Mongol swordsman.Sitting unmoved in the posture of meditation, Sogan spoke, extempore, this verse which, in my opinion, can never be too often quoted.Though, like a lightning flash, some swordMay lop my head, it were as thoughSpring winds were slashed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One is not awedBy threats of such a blowless blow.“As you will recall, the Mongol swordsman was so discountenanced by that calm asservation of the power of Mind, of the life no killing sword can kill, that he simply ran away.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps, after years of the hard-est training of the mind, we, too, might reach that ultimate passivity where, with the same empowered disconcern so spiritedly shown by Sogan, we too might understand how, like a flash of lightning, the sword cuts through the breeze of spring.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I do not pretend yet to understand anything so difficult, but of this I’m certain: that it is dangerously mistaken to place your entire trust in Western positivism.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Your own case proves my point.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However positively you struggle, you can’t stop the schoolboys teasing you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, if you had the power to close the school or could prove such serious wrong doing as would merit police attention, things might be different.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But things are not that different and, as things actually are, you have no chance, however positivist your actions, of coming out on top.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Any positivist approach to your problem involves the question, and the power, of money; it also involves the fact that you are in a minority of one against heavy odds.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In brief, if you continue to behave as a Westerner would, you’ll be forced to knuckle under to the rich man and, by sheer weight of their numbers, to be humiliated by the little boys.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The basic reason for your baleful discontent lies in the fact that you are a man of no wealth seeking, all on your own, to pursue a quarrel on positivist lines.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There,” he concluded his lengthy dissertation, “you have it in a nutshell.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Do you understand what I’ve been saying?”My master, who had listened in attentive silence, said neither that he understood nor that he didn’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But after this extraordinary visitor had taken his leave, my master retired to sit in his study where, without even opening a book, he seemed to be lost in thought.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Suzuki had preached that the wise man goes with the tide and always truckles to the wealthy.Dr.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Amaki had given his professional opinion that jangled nerves may be steadied by hypnotism.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And our last visitor had made it very clear that in his remarkable view that a man can only attain to peace of mind by training himself to be passive.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It remains for my master to decide which course of action or inaction he wishes to follow.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But one thing’s certain: he cannot go on as he is, and something must be done.IIMY MASTER is pockmarked.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though I hear that pockmarked faces were well regarded in the days before the restoration of the Emperor, in these enlightened times of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, such cratered features look distinctly out of date.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The decline of the pockmark began precisely when the birthrate started to climb, so one may confidently expect that it will soon become extinct.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This conclusion is an inescapable deduction from medical statistics; these, being thus scientifically established, even a cat, a creature as penetrating critical as myself, would not dare cast doubt upon it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I cannot, offhand, quote statistics of the current incidence of pockmarks among the population of the world, but in my own district and among my many associates, no single cat and only one human being is so grievously afflicted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That human oddity is, I am deeply sorry to say, my poor, old, pitted master.Every time I catch sight of it, I am moved by that pot-holed visage to reflect upon the dire ill luck which brought my master to live and breathe the air of this twentieth century through a face so anachronistic.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Once upon a long time back, he might have made a brave showing of his disastrous dimples.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But in these present times when, by virtue of the vaccination laws of 1870, all pockmarks have been ordered into reservations on the upper arms, the determined squatting of such sunken-nesses on the wan wastes of his cheeks and on the very tip of his nose, while perhaps admirable for their resistance to the drifts of change, is in fact a slur upon the honor of all pockmarks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I think it would be best if my master just got rid of them as quickly as he can.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It seems to me that those pockmarks must feel lonely.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Or could it be that they crowd together in a clutter on his face as for some final gathering of doomed clans still driven by a mad ambition to restore their fallen fortunes to a former state of glory?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If that should be the case, one should not slight these pockmarks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There they are, a rallying of eternal dents, last-ditch indentations entrenched to block the march of time and rapid change.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such deep redoubts deserve our deep respect.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The only snag is that they are also so deeply dirty.Now, there flourished in the days of my master’s childhood a certain noted physician of Chinese medicine, Asada So-haku, who lived in Ushigome.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When that old man went out upon his rounds, he invariably traveled, very, very slowly, in a palanquin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As soon as he was dead, and his adopted son had taken over the practice, the palanquin was put away in favor of a rickshaw.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No doubt in time’s due course the adopted son’s adopted son will put away the invariable herb tea of his predecessors and start prescribing aspirin; however, even in the first So-haku’s heyday, it was regarded as shabbily old-fashioned to be troudled through the streets of Tokyo in a palanquin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Only long established ghosts, dead pigs on their way to freight yards, and, of course, So-haku’s doddering self saw nothing unpresentable about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I tell you this because my master’s pockmarks are as datedly unseemly as So-haku’s palanquin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Persons who clap eyes upon my blighted patron naturally feel a little sorry for him.But every day my master, no less obstinate and insensitive than that trundled quack of an herbalist, serenely saunters off to school, his lone and helpless pockmarks bared to a dumb struck world, there to instruct his dullard students in the mysteries of the English Reader.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And precisely because he is their teacher, the lessons to be learnt from a now departed era, deeply graven on his hapless face, are, in addition to his intended instruction, usefully imparted to his pupils.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Again and again, reading from his treasured texts, his mouth transmits the precious truth that “monkeys have hands,” but all the time his silent skin gives out its clear and frightening answer to unasked questions about the effect of smallpox on the face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Were men as warningly disfigured as my master to abandon the teaching profession, students concerned with the smallpox problem would be obliged to hie themselves off to libraries and museums, there to expend as much mental energy on visualizing pockmarks as we are forced to expend in our attempts to visualize the men of ancient Egypt by staring at their mummies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Considered from this angle, my master’s blemishes, albeit unintentionally, are virtuous in performance.However, it was not as an act of virtuous performance that my master plowed his face and scattered thereupon the tiny seeds of smallpox.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s barely credible, but the fact is that my master was actually once vaccinated.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unfortunately, the vaccine planted in his arm contrived, I know not how, to evade the intended localization and, instead, burst forth in ugly flower all over his face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since this apparently happened when, being a child, he had neither the least romantic inclination nor any consciousness of our present high evaluation of a clear complexion, he consequently scratched away at his face wherever it felt itchy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Like volcanoes his many boils erupted and, as their yellow lava trickled down all over his face, the original appearance given him by his parents was irremediably wrecked.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every now and again my master still assures his wife that, before that business of the smallpox, he was a striking boy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
At times he even boasts that he was indeed so remarkably beautiful that Europeans were wont to turn around in the street simply to take a second look at him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, of course, quite possible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, sad to say, there’s no one who can vouch for it.Nevertheless, no matter how virtuous or how pregnant with admon-itory truths a thing may be, if it is a dirty thing it still remains disgusting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, from as far back as his memory can reach, my master has been niggled by his pockmarks and has examined every conceivable method by which his tangerine appearance might be chamfered down to a texture less offensive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, his pockmarks cannot just be garaged out of sight like So-haku’s palanquin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They manifest themselves, and their blatant self-exposure so weighs upon his mind that, every time he walks along a street, he carefully counts the number of pockmarked persons he may be so lucky as to see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His diary logs the details.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How many pockmarked persons, male or female, met that day, the place of the encounter, perhaps the general store at Ogawamachi, perhaps in Ueno Park.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sometimes he cheats with a specific count of pockmarks, but usually contents himself with a slight exaggeration of the general intensity of the pocking.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Where pockmarks are concerned, he reckons himself an authority second to none.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The subject so obsesses him that the other day, when one of his friends, just back from foreign travels, called around to see him, he opened their conversation with the question, “Are there pockmarks to be seen in Europe?”His friend first answered, “Well,” and then, tilting his head, gave himself up to long consideration before replying, “They are very seldom seen.”“Very seldom,” repeated my master in despondent tones, “but,” and a note of hope strengthened his voicing of the question, “there are, aren’t there, just a few?”“If there are, their owners will be either beggars or tramps.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I doubt whether any pockmarks can be found on members of the educated classes,” came the indifferent reply.“Really?” said my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Then it must be very different from how things are in Japan.”Accepting the philosopher’s advice, my master has given up quarreling with those little louts from Cloud Descending Hall and, since that act of abrogation, has secluded himself in his study to brood about something else.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He may indeed be following the philosopher’s recommenda-tion that he should sit in silence and by negative activity advance the mental training of his soul; whatever he’s up to, I’m sure no good can come of encouraging a cabbage, that creature born to craven passive-ness, to indulge himself in loafing gloomy idleness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I have come to the conclusion that he’d be far better off if he pawned his English books and took up with some geisha who might at least teach him how far it is to Tipperary.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But bigots such as he would never listen to a cat’s advice; so I decided to let him stew in his own dull juice and have accordingly not been near the man for the last six days.Today’s the seventh day since I left him stewing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since Zen practice includes the discipline of sitting in cross-legged meditation for a week long stretch, a discipline designed to bring divine enlightenment by sheer determination, I thought it possible that, by now, my master, dead or alive, might have meditated to some real effect.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, I slouched my way from the veranda and, peering in through the entrance to his study, looked for any sign of movement in the room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The study, a modest area of some hundred square feet, faces south with a big desk planted in its sunniest spot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Big” is an understatement, for the desk is truly vast.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Six feet long and nearly four feet wide, it stands proportionately high.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Naturally, this mammoth object was not ready made but, the bespoke handiwork of a neighboring cabinet maker, it was most curiously required to serve both as a desk and as a bed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Never having discussed the matter with my master, I cannot possibly tell you how he came to order such an acreage of wood or why he ever contemplated sleeping on it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It may have been some passing whim which led to this enormity, the product of that process whereby certain types of lunatic associate two unassociable ideas.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Certainly the association of the concept of a desk with the concept of a bed is genuinely remarkable.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The trouble is that, for all its striking remarkability, the thing is virtually useless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Some time ago I happened to be watching while my master lay at snooze upon this ludicrous contraption.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I watched, he turned in his sleep, tumbled off and rolled out onto the veranda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since that day he seems only to have used it as a desk.In front of the desk lies a skimpy cushion whose cover of pure wool muslin is decorated with three or four small holes, all in one area, burnt there by his cigarettes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The cotton stuffing leaking through these holes looks distinctly grimed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The man so ceremoniously sitting on this cushion, with his back and foot soles turned toward us, is, of course, my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His sash is knotted just above his bottom, and the two sash ends of some grubby gray material dangle down limply against his staring soles.Only the other day he gave me a savage smack just because I tried to play with those dangling ends.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Those ends are ends strictly not to be touched.He seemed still to be lost in meditation, and, as I moved to look beyond his shoulder, I recalled the saying that pointless pondering is a waste of time.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I was accordingly surprised to see something gleaming strangely on his desk.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In spite of myself I blinked and blinked again.Very strange it was, indeed a thing to blink at.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Withstanding the glare as best I could, I studied this glittering object and suddenly realized that I was being dazzled by his manipulation of a mirror on his desk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What on earth, I naturally wondered, is my master doing with a mirror in the study?Mirrors belong in the bathroom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, it was only this morning that, visiting the bathroom, I saw this mirror there.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My powers of recognition are, of course, remarkable; I hardly needed to exercise them, for the bathroom mirror is the only one in the house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master uses it every morning when, having washed his face, he proceeds to comb a parting into his hair.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My readers may well wonder that a man of my master’s character should bother to part his hair but, though he is indeed bone-idle about all other aspects of personal grooming, he really does take trouble with his hair.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Never since I joined this household, not even in the broiling beat of summer, have I seen my master’s hair cropped close against his skull.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Invariably, his hair is long, three inches long, carefully parted on the left with an inappropriately cocky quiff turned up in a ducktail on the right side of his scalp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This hairstyle may, of course, be nothing more than another symptom of mental disease.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, though this flash coiffure hardly accords with the antique dignity of his desk, it harms nobody and no one ever carps about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Leaving aside all further discussion of the weird modernity of his parting, one may more usefully turn to consider the reason for his bizarre behavior.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The fact is that his pockmarks do not merely pit his open face but, ever since early childhood, have extended their erosions right up over his scalp.Consequently, if he cut his hair like a normal man to a mere half inch or less, dozens and dozens of pockmarks would then be visible among the roots of his crop.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No matter how hard he brushed or smoothed a close-cut head of hair, the spotty dots of his pockmarks would still shine whitely through.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The effect could well be quite poetic, like a swarm of glow worms in a stubble field, but certainly his wife would not appreciate the spectacle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With his hair long, his scalp could be inalveolate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Why then should he go out of his way to expose his pitiable deformity?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, he would, if he could, grow whiskers all over his face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Would it not then be crazy to spend good money on haircuts that can only expose his pitted pate to general derision, when hair that grows cost-free will hide what best were hid?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That, then, is the reason why my master keeps his hair long.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Because it’s long, he must part it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Because he parts it, he must peer in a mirror and keep that mirror in the bathroom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Hence also why the bathroom mirror is the only pier glass in the house.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How then comes that sole existing mirror, that characteristically bathroom feature, to be glint-ing about in the study?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unless the glass has sickened into somnabulism, my master must have brought it there.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And if so, why?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Could it be that he needs a mirror as an adjunct to his spiritual training in negative activity?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am led to recall the ancient story of the scholar who visited a Buddhist priest, far famed for his great virtue and enlightenment, only to find him sweating away at polishing a tile.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“What are you doing?” asked the scholar.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I’m doing my best to make a mirror.” In some surprise the scholar pointed out that, though the priest was a man of marvelous parts, no man in the world could ever polish a tile to be a mirror.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“In that case,” said the priest, “I’ll stop the polishing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But,” and he burst out laughing, “the parallel would seem to be that no man learns enlightenment by scholarly perusal of whole libraries of books.” It may be that my master has heard some version of this tale about the uselessness of scholarship and, armed with the bathroom mirror, now seeks triumphantly to demonstrate that nothingness is all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I watch him cautiously, suddenly conscious that his mental instability may well be taking a dangerous turn.My master, oblivious of my presence and my thinking, continues to stare, transfixedly and with an air of wild enthusiasm, into our one and only mirror.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Actually, a mirror is a sinister thing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m told it takes real courage, alone at night, in a large room lit by a single candle, to stare into a mirror.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed the first time that my master’s eldest daughter shoved a mirror in front of my face, I was so simultaneously startled and alarmed that I ran around the house three times without stopping.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even in broad daylight, anyone who stares into a mirror with the fixed absorption now being displayed by my master will end up terrified of his own reflected face; I am bound to observe that my master’s face, even at first glance, is not exactly lacking in immediate sinisterity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I sat and watched.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
After a while my master began talking to himself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Yes,” he said, “I can see that it’s a dirty face.” I must say his acknowledgement of his own repulsiveness merits praise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Judging by appearances, his behavior is that of a madman, but what he says rings true.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It struck me that if he goes one step further down this thorny path, he will be horrified by his own ugliness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unless in his heart of hearts a man knows himself for a blackguard, he will never be wise in the ways of this world; a man who lacks that wisdom will never sufficiently rid himself of passion as to attain enlightenment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, having come thus far toward recognizing his intrinsic blackguardism, should now be shuddering back from the mirror with some cry from the heart such as, “Ah, how terrifying.”He has, as you know, said nothing of the sort.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Instead, having gotten so far as to admit out loud the nastiness of his face, he does no more than to start puffing out his cheeks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I cannot tell why he so ballooned himself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Next, with the palms of both hands, two or three times, he slapped his bloated chops.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps, I thought, some ritual act of sorcery.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And at the moment of so thinking I had the feeling that, somewhere I had seen that pursy face before.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
From my ransacked memory the sudden truth emerged.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His is the face of O-san.It would, I think, be proper if I here devoted a few lines to describing the face of my master’s female servant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is a tumid face, a face like that bulbous lantern made from a dried and gutted blowfish which someone bought while visiting a fox god’s shrine, and then, when visiting this house, unloaded on my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Her face is so malignly puffy that both her eyes are sunken out of sight.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course the puffiness of a blowfish is evenly distributed all over its globular body; in the case of O-san’s mug, the underlying bone-structure is angularly fashioned so that its overlying puffiness creates the effect of an hexagonal clock far gone in some dread dropsy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If O-san were to hear these comments, she’d be so actively angered that I deem it prudent to resume my interrupted account of my seemingly sorcerous master.As I have already mentioned, first he blew his cheeks out, then he started slapping them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That done, he began once more to babble to himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“When the skin is stretched,” he said, “one hardly sees the pockmarks.” Next, turning sideways to present his profile to the light, he pored upon his image in the glass.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“This way, very bad.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The side light shows them up.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It seems that, after all, they look least there when the light’s from dead in front.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But even then,” and he spoke as if quite genuinely impressed, “they’re still extremely nasty.” He then stretched out his right hand holding the mirror as far as it would go.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He scrutinized the glass.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“At a distance, not so bad.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I thought, it’s the close-up view that’s awful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Still, that’s true of most things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not,” his mumblings came out clearly as though he’d lighted upon some marvelous, long hid truth,“just of pockmarked faces.” Next, he suddenly laid the mirror, glass upward, flat on the desk and began contracting his facial muscles so that his brows, his eyebrows, even his very eyes, all seemed drawn in one wild whorl of wrinkles around the crease where his nose springs out from his skull.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How hideous, I thought.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, too, seemed shaken by the sight, for he muttered, “That won’t do,” and ceased his vile contractions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I wonder,” he went on, lifting the mirror up to a point but three short inches from his pot-holed skin, “why my face is so extraordinarily repulsive.” He sounded as though honestly perplexed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
With his right index finger he begins to stroke the wings of his nose.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Breaking off, he presses his fingertip hard down on his blotting pad.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The grease appeared as a round blob on the blotter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He has indeed some charming little ways.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Next he raises his nose-greased fingertip and hauls down on his right lower eyelid daringly to produce a red-fleshed goblin look, an ugly trick which, very understandably, is commonly described as making a hare’s face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is not entirely clear whether he is studying his pockmarks or merely trying to stare his mirror down.Let us, however, be generous.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is a quirky man, but at least it seems that in his case such staring at a bathroom mirror does induce original ideas, even original actions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nor is that all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such quaint behavior could be seen, by well-disposed and drolly natured persons, as the means by which my master moves, madly gesticulating and with a mirror for companion, toward a revelation of his inmost nature—toward, in Zen terms, his Original Face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All studies undertaken by human beings are always studies of themselves.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The proper study of mankind is self.The heavens, earth, the mountains and the rivers, sun and moon and stars—they are all no more than other names for the self.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There is nothing a man can study which is not, in the end, the study of the self.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
If a man could jump out of his self that self would disappear at the moment of his jumping.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nor is that all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only oneself can study one’s self It is totally impossible for anyone else to do it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Totally impossible, no matter how earnestly one may wish either to study another or to be studied by another.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which explains why all great men invariably achieve greatness solely by their own efforts.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If it were true that you could learn to understand yourself by virtue of someone else’s helping effort, then you could, for instance, declare whether some hunk of meat were tough or tender by getting someone else to eat it for you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But hearing truths preached in the morning, listening all evening to learned expositions of the Way, reading scholarly tomes the night long in your study—all these worthy activities are nothing but disciplines designed to facilitate your perception of your own true self.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet that true self of yours cannot conceivably exist in the truth preached at you by some other person, or in the Way some other man expounds, or in ancient books however heaped upon you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If your own self exists, it is your personal phantom, a kind of doppelganger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, it’s often the case that a phantom has more substance than a soulless person.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For if you dog a shadow, one fine day you may well find its substance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, as a general rule, shadows adhere to their substances.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If it is as a reflection of such concepts that my master’s toying with the bathroom mirror should be seen, then he may be someone to be reckoned with.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For surely those who seek the truth in themselves are wiser, better men than such fool scholars whose only claim to wisdom is that they have gulped down all that Epictetus scribbled on that subject.A mirror is a vat for brewing self-conceit, yet, at the same time, a means to neutralize all vanity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nothing shows up the absurd pretensions of a show-off more incitingly than a mirror.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since time began, the pretentious and the vainglorious have gone about the world inflicting damage both upon themselves and upon others, and the first cause of at least two-thirds of that injury undoubtedly lay in mirrors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Like that wretched Dr. Guillotin, who unintentionally caused himself, quite apart from many others, so much painful inconvenience during the French Revolution by inventing an improved method of decapitation, the man who invented the mirror must almost certainly have lived to regret it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the other hand, for persons beginning to sicken into self-disgust and for persons already feeling spiritually shriveled, there’s nothing quite so tonic as a good long look in a mirror.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For any such observer cannot fail to realize as a staggering fact the effrontery of his having dared to go about for years with such an appalling face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The moment of that realization is the most precious moment in any man’s life, and none looks more exaltedly transfigured than a fool grown self-enlightened to his own intrinsic folly.Before this self-enlightened fool all the world’s vainglorious ninnies should, in the deepest awe, abase themselves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such ninnies may indeed sneer in contempt at the enlightened one, but in reality their triumphing contempt is an expression, however unwitting, of an awed submission.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I doubt whether my master has the depth to realize his foolishness by staring into a mirror, but he is at least capable of acknowledging the ugly truth pox-graven on his phiz.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Recognition of the loathliness of one’s face often proves a first step forward toward realizing the depravity of one’s soul.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master shows promise.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But this glint of wisdom may, of course, be nothing more than a fleeting consequence of his having been put down in his recent encounter with that Zen-bent chum of his.Musing idly along these lines, I went on watching my master.Unaware of my surveillance, he continued happily tugging at his eyelids to produce a series of increasingly horrible caricatures of his naturally nasty features.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“They seem,” he suddenly said, “distinctly bloodshot.Chronic conjunctivitis.” He closed his eyes and thereupon began to frot their reddened lids with the flank of his index finger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I imagine they must be itching, but eyes already so irksomely inflamed are hardly likely to be soothed by such vigorous abrasion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he keeps it up, it won’t be long before his eyes just decompose like those of a salted bream.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
After a bit he reopened his lids and peered back into the mirror.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as I’d feared, his eyes have all the glassy leadenness of the winter sky of some northern country.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As a matter of fact, whatever the season, his eyes are never exactly bright or even clear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They are, to coin a term, nubeculoid: so muzzily inchoate that nothing differentiates their pupils and their whites.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as his mind is dim and vaporous, so too his eyes, cloudily unfocused, drift pointlessly around.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Some say this eye defect was caused by infection contracted when still in the womb, others that it is an after effect of his childhood smallpox.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, he was thoroughly dosed as a tot with decoctions of red frogs and of those insects found on willow trees.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps because such cures are properly intended to eradicate peevishness in children, the doubtless loving care of his doubtless loving mother seems to have been wasted upon him, for, to this day, his eyes have remained as swimmingly vacuous as on the day he was born.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My personal conviction is that neither antenatal poisoning nor infantile smallpox are in any way responsible for his inner blear of eye.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That lamentable condition, the persistent drifting of his gaze, the dark turbidity of his eyeballs, are all no more than external signs of the darkly turbid content of his mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, since he is responsible for the long, gray drizzle of his own dismal thoughts, he should be chided for their outward manifestations which occasioned so much needless worry to his innocent mother.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Where there’s a drift of smoke, there you will find a fire.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Where there are drifting eyes, there you will find a half-wit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since his eyes reflect his mind, which is about as much use as a hole in the head, I can understand why his goggle eyes, the shape and size of those old-time coins with holes right through them, are as totally vacuous as they are unsuited to these times.My master next began to twirl his moustache.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, by nature, an unruly growth, each individual hair sticking out in whatever direction happens to take its surly fancy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though individualism is currently very much the fashion, if every moustache hair behaved thus egotistically, gentlemen so adorned would be sadly inconvenienced.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Having given the matter considerable thought, my master has recently begun trying to train his various tufts into some sort of general order and, to be fair, he’s had a modest measure of success, for his whiskers have of late shown signs of acquiring a certain sense of cooperative discipline.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Originally, the growth was a mere haphazard extension of hair through the skin of his upper lip, but now it is possible for him to claim with pride that he keeps a moustache.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All determination is strengthened by success.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And my master, conscious that his moustache has a promising future, gives it every encouragement, not just in the mornings and at bedtime, but on every possible occasion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His dearest ambition is to sport twin upturned spikes like those on Kaiser Bill, so, disregarding the random inclinations of his pores, some pointed sideways, some straight down, he hauls his tuft growths hideously heavenward.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which must be very painful for those wretched hairs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, it’s clear that even my master sometimes finds it painful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But that, of course, is the essence of training.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Willing or not, in pain or not, the tufts are being disciplined to stick straight up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To any objective observer this drill must seem a silly sort of occupation, but to my master it makes good sense; one can hardly reproach him when the whole educational system of this country is similarly designed so that teachers may go about bragging that they can twist their student’s real characters into upward aspirations as daft as a waxed moustache.My master was thus brutally drilling his whiskers when the hexagonal O-san advanced from the kitchen and, sticking a raw red hand into the study with her customary lack of ceremony, abruptly stated, “The mail, master.” My master, still holding his moustache uptwisted in his right hand and the mirror in his left, turned round toward the entrance.As soon as O-san, who knows that growth for the ragged flop it is, clapped eyes upon what looked like two fish snuggled under my master’s nose with their tails frisked up on either side of it, she threw down some letters and scuttled off back to the kitchen where, her whole fat body bent across the lid of the rice-cooker, she lay convulsed with laughter.My master, nowise perturbed by her performance, put down the mirror with the utmost composure and gathered up the scattered post.The first letter is a printed communication imposingly heavy with formal Chinese characters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It reads as follows:Dear Sir,	May we offer you the compliments of the season.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Please permit us to congratulate you upon your present prosperity, and long may it continue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As we are all aware, the Russo-Japanese War has ended in our complete and total victory, and peace has been restored.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Most of our officers and men, loyal, brave, and gallant, are singing victory-songs amidst that incessant cheering which signifies the heart-felt joy of all our people.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At the call to arms, these officers and men, selflessly sacrificing themselves for the public good, went forth to endure the broiling heat and the piercing cold in foreign parts thousands of miles from home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There, unstintingly, they risked their lives, fighting on our behalf.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such faithful devotion to duty must never be forgotten.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We should carry a living consciousness thereof always, close to our hearts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
By the end of this month the last of our triumphant troops will have returned.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, our association, which represents this district, proposes to hold, on the 25th instant, a major victory celebration honoring the thousand or so officers, noncommissioned officers, petty officers, and private soldiers who hail from our district.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We would also wish to welcome to this occasion all those bereaved families whose dear ones fell on the field of battle.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We desire thus to express with human warmth our sympathy with them in their loss and our sincere gratitude to them for their menfolk’s sacrifice and valor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would give our association the greatest pleasure, indeed it would do us credit, if we could carry out the proposed ceremony in the knowledge of your approval.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We therefore sincerely hope you will signify your approval of our proposal by a generous subscription to this worthy cause.The letter is signed by a peer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, having read it through in silence, replaces it in the envelope.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He looks quite unconcerned and shows no sign whatsoever of any readiness to cough up cash.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The other day he did actually contribute a few pence for the relief of those whom the poor crops in the northeast had exposed to famine.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But ever since he made that gift he has bombarded everyone he meets with complaints that the subscription was a robbery.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he voluntarily subscribed, he can’t possibly call it robbery.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, indeed, most improper to use a word with such criminal implications.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, my master really does seem to think he really was robbed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I consequently think it most unlikely that he will part with his precious money in response to a mere printed letter, certainly not to a letter so civilly written and unperemptory, even though the cause is as noble as a victory celebration, and its canvasser as noble as a nobleman can be.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As my master sees it, before honoring the army, he’d like to be honored himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After he has been sufficiently honored, he well might honor almost anything; so long as he continues having to scrape along in penny-pinched obscurity, he seems content to leave the honoring of armies to peers who can afford it.“Oh dear,” he said as he picked up the second envelope, “another printed letter.” He then began, with steadily growing interest, to read what it said.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We offer our congratulations that you and your family should be enjoying good prosperity at this season of chilly autumn.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As you are aware, over the past three years the operation of our school has been greatly hindered by a few overacquisitive men.Indeed at one stage, things looked very serious.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, having realized that all those difficulties originated in certain of my own fail-ings, I, your humble servant Shinsaku, communed and expostulated most deeply with myself in respect of those regrettable deficiencies and, having endured unspeakable self-criticism, hardships, and priva-tions, I have at long last found a way unaided to obtain sufficient funds to construct the new school building in a style compatible with my own ideals.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The fact is that I am about to publish a book entitled The Essentials of the Secret Art of Sewing: A Separate Volume.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This book, which I, your humble servant Shinsaku, have composed at immense trouble, is written in strict accordance with that theory and those principles of industrial art which, for many years, I have so painfully been studying.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I hope that every household will buy a copy of this book, the price of which is no more than the actual cost of producing it with little or nothing added as profit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For I am convinced that this book will serve to advance the art of sewing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At the same time, the modest profits I anticipate from its sale should be sufficient to finance the needed extensions to the school buildings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Therefore, I should be most grateful and honored if you would, by way of making a donation toward the construction expenses of the school house, be so kind as to purchase a copy of the aforementioned Essentials of the Secret Art of Sewing, a book which you could, for instance, advantageously put in the hands of your maidservant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I do most humbly and sincerely hope you will grant me your support in this matter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With the utmost respect and good will, and with nine respectful bows,Nuida ShinsakuPrincipalGreat Japan Women’s HighGraduate School of SewingMy master indifferently crumpled this courteous letter into a ball and pitched it lightly into the waste-paper basket.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am sorry to say that Mr.Shinsaku’s nine respectful bows and his many unspeakable hardships all came to nothing.My master then took up his third letter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This one gleams with quite extraordinary luster.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Its envelope is brightly colored with red and white stripes and looks as gay as a signboard advertising boiled sweets.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Right in the center of these dazzling slats there is written in a thickly, flowery calligraphic style, “O Rare Dr. Sneaze!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With Deep Respect.” Whatever this envelope may contain, its externalities are extremely grand.Sir,	If I am to dominate the universe, then I would, in one swift go, swallow up the whole world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if the universe is to rule over me, then I would become no more than a mote of dust.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tell me, I entreat you, what is the correct relation between myself and the universe.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The person who first ate sea slugs deserves respect for his daring.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The man who first ate blowfish should be honored for his bravery.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He who added sea slugs to our diet performed a service for the nation comparable to Shinran’s founding of the Pure Land sect, and the con-tributor of blowfish may be fairly compared with such a courageous religious innovator as the great Priest Nichiren.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But you, dear Dr. Sneaze, your gastronomic genius stretches no further than to dried gourd shavings dressed with vinegared bean-paste.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I have yet to meet a man of parts whose prowess was advanced by eating dried gourd shavings dressed with vinegared bean-paste.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Your closest friend might betray you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Your very parents might turn cold toward you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even your own true love might cast you off.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No man, naturally, can put his trust in wealth or worldly honors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Lands and peerages can vanish in the twinkling of an eye.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even a lifetime’s scholarship treasured in one’s head goes moldy in the end.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On what, then, Dr. Sneaze, do you intend to rely?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What is there in the whole, wide universe on which you dare depend?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
God?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"God is a mere clay figure fabricated in the depths of their despair by dreggy persons, by beings themselves so terrified as to be nothing more than stinking lumps of shit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Could it be that you claim nevertheless to find some ease of mind by putting your trust in objects that you know to be untrustworthy?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ah, what a depth of folly!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A staggering drunkard, babbling senseless words, totters, however weavingly, straight toward his grave.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"If you disdain others, you have nothing to fear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why is it, then, that you, who do disdain all others, are nonetheless enraged at the world which disdains you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
High-ranking and distinguished persons seem to be puffed up by their disdain for people.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, as soon as they feel themselves disdained, they flare up in real anger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let them flare up.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They are all idiots!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When due regard is given to other people but those other people do not reciprocate, then, instead of just complaining, the discontented are liable, every now and again, to seek redress of their grievance by some positive action.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such spasmodic action is called revolution.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Revolutions are not the work of mere grumblers, but are the happy handiwork of high-ranking and distinguished persons who enjoy promoting them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Honored sir, there is a great deal of ginseng in Korea.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why, dear Dr. Sneaze, don’t you give it a try?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Written from Colney Hatch	and dispatched with two respectful bows	by Providence FairThe needle-plying Shinsaku had offered nine such bows, but Providence Fair produces only a measly brace, and, since his letter does not ask for money, he must, to the extent of seven respectful bobbings, be that much the more arrogant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Still, even though the letter does not scrounge for cash, its vile construction and indigestible contents make it equally painful to receive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Were it submitted to a magazine, even the scurviest, it would undoubtedly be rejected, and I felt consequently sure that my master, who never likes to put the least strain on his gray matter, would just tear it up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
To my immense surprise he reads it over and over again.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps he cannot credit that a posted letter might actually have no meaning and is determined to discover what this one seeks to convey.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The world is crammed with conundrums, but none of them are totally meaningless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No matter how incomprehensible a phrase may be, a willing listener can always wring some kind of message out of it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You can say mankind is stupid or that mankind is astute: either way, the statement makes some sense.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, one can go much further.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is not incomprehensible if one says that human beings are dogs or pigs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nor would it occasion any surprise if one stated that a mountain was low; or that the universe is small.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One could well get away with claiming that crows are white, that living dolls are dead ugly, even that my master is a man of worth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It follows that even a letter as weird as Mr. Fair’s could, if one really bent one’s mind to the effort, be twisted to make sense.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And a man like my master, who has spent his whole life explaining the meanings of English words which he does not understand, naturally has small difficulty in wrenching meaning out of mumbo-jumbo totally uninterpretable by anyone else.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is, after all, the very fellow who, when one of his pupils asked why people still say “Good morning” when the weather happens to be bad, pondered that knotty problem for seven days at a stretch.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I remember, too, that he once devoted three whole days and three long nights to an attempt at establishing the correct way for a Japanese to pronounce the name of Columbus.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such a man finds no trouble at all in making free interpretations of anything he comes across: he could, for instance, interpret a habit of eating dried gourd shavings dressed with vinegared bean-paste as a sure indicator of inherent ability to achieve world fame, and with similar ease he could identify ginseng-eaters as the instigators of revolutions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, it soon became clear that my master, demonstrating yet again that perspicacity and depth of mind which he once bought to bear on the knotty matter of saying “Good morning” at times of nasty weather, has penetrated to the inner meanings of the crazy letter sent him with two respectful bows.“This letter,” he breathed in tones of the deepest admiration, “is fraught with profound significance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Whoever wrote these words is an adept of philosophies.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The sweep, the range, the grasp of the mind behind this letter are truly stupendous.”Which only goes to show how daft my master is.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, on second thought, perhaps he isn’t quite so stupid at all.Habitually he values whatever he does not understand, but he is by no means alone in that behavior.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Something unignorable lurks in whatever passes our understanding, and there is something inherently noble in that which we cannot measure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For which reason laymen are loud in their praises of matters they do not understand and scholars lecture unintelligibly on points as clear as day.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This lesson is daily demonstrated in our universities, where incomprehensible lectures are both deeply respected and popular, while those whose words are easily understood are shunned as shallow thinkers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master admired his third letter, not because its meaning was clear, but precisely because large tracts of it were utterly incomprehensible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He was touched, I would say, by the total lack of reason for the letter’s sudden irrelevant sallies into such matters as the first consumption of sea slugs and its description of the-ists as terror-frantic shit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, as Taoists are most deeply ravished by the most gnomic sayings of Lao-tzu, as followers of Confucius laud the Book of Changes, and as Zen priests dote on the Collected Thoughts of Lin Chi, so my master admires that letter because he hasn’t the faintest idea what it means.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, it wouldn’t do not to understand it at all; so, reading its nonsense in accordance with his gift for free interpretation, he manages to convince himself that he’s grasped its real intent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, it’s always pleasant to admire something incomprehensible when you think you understand it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So it was with understandable reverence that my master refolded the florid calligraphy of that precious letter and placed it gently down upon the desk before him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He sits there, lost in meditation, head bowed and his hands sunk deep within his clothing.Suddenly, there came a loud voice from the entrance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Hello there!Can I come in?” It sounds like that of Waverhouse, but most uncharacteristically, it keeps on asking for admission.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master obviously hears the constant calling, but, keeping his hands buried in his clothes, makes no move whatsoever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps he holds it as a principle that the master of a house should not answer a caller, for in my experience he has never, at least not from his study, ever cried, “Come in.” The maidservant has just gone out to buy some soap and Mrs. Sneaze is busy in the lavatory, so that leaves only me to answer the door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, frankly, I do not care to.The matter was, however, settled when the visitor, grown impatient, stepped up onto the veranda by the door, walked in uninvited and left the door wide open.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the matter of civilities, my master and his visitor seem a perfect match.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The visitor first went into the living room but, having fruitlessly opened and shut various of its sliding doors, then marched into the study.“Well, really!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What on earth are you doing?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Don’t you know you’ve got a visitor?”“Ah, so it’s you.”“Is that all you have to say?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You should’ve answered if you were in.The house seemed positively deserted.”“Well, as it happens, I’ve got something on my mind.”“Even so, you could at least have said, ‘Come in.’”“I could have.”“The same old iron nerves.”“The fact is that lately I’ve been concentrating on training my mind.”“Fantastic!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And what will become of your visitors if your trained mind makes you incapable of answering the door?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wish you wouldn’t sit there looking so smugly cool.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The point is that I’m not alone today.I’ve brought along someone very unusual.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Won’t you come out and meet him?”“Whom have you brought?”“Never mind that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just come out and meet him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s most anxious to meet you.”“Who is it?”“Never mind who.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just get up.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s a good fellow.”My master stood up without removing his hands from his clothing.“I’ll bet you’re pulling my leg again,” he grumbled as, passing along the veranda, he walked into the drawing room with the clear expectation of finding it empty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But there, politely facing the alcove in the wall, sat an old man whose stiffly upright posture expressed both a natural courtesy and a certain solemnity of mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Involuntarily, my master first brought his hands into view and then immediately sat down with his bottom pushed hard up against the sliding-door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By this precipitate action my master finished up facing in the same westerly direction as the old man, so that it was now impossible for them to bow to each other in formal greeting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And the older generation remains extremely rigid in matters of etiquette.“Please be seated there,” said the old man urging my master to take his proper place with his back to the alcove.Up until a few years ago, my master assumed that it did not matter where one sat in a room; but since the day when someone told him that an alcove is a modified form of that upper room where envoys of the Shogun were accustomed to seat themselves, he avoids that place like the plague.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, and especially now that an unfamiliar elderly person is present, nothing will induce him to sit down in the place of honor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, he cannot even manage a proper greeting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He just bowed once and then exactly repeated the words used by his visitor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Please be seated there.”“I beg of you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am at a loss to greet you properly unless you sit over there.”“Oh no, I beg of you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Please, you sit over there.” My master seems unable to do anything but parrot his guest.“Sir, your modesty overwhelms me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am unworthy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Please don’t stand on ceremony.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And please do sit there.”“Sir, your modesty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
overwhelms you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"please,” came the jumbled answer from my scarlet faced master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His mental training does not seem to have had much useful effect.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse, who has been delightedly watching this ridiculous performance from a position just outside the door, evidently thought it had gone on long enough.“Move over.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you plant yourself so close to the door, I shan’t be able to find a place to sit down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Get along with you, don’t be shy.” He prodded my master with his foot and then, bending down, unceremoniously shoved at my master’s bottom from behind until he was able to force himself between the two seated figures facing the alcove.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master reluctantly slid forward.“Sneaze, this is my uncle from Shizuoka of whom you’ve often heard me speak.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Uncle, this is Mr. Sneaze.”“How do you do?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Waverhouse tells me that you have been very kind and that you let him come on frequent visits.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve been meaning myself to call on you for a long time and today, as I happened to be in the neighborhood, I decided to come and thank you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I beg to be favored with your acquaintance.”The old man delivers his old-fashioned speech of greeting with great fluency.Not only is my master taciturn by nature and possessed of few acquaintances, but he has rarely, if ever, met anyone of this antiquated type.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He was thus ill at ease from the start, and became increasingly scared as the old man’s flood of language washed about his ears.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All thoughts of Korean ginseng, of the shining stripes of that red and white envelope, or of other aids to mental discipline have slipped from his mind, and his incoherent stutter of response betrays his desperation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I, too.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"yes, I also.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
just meant to call on you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
pleased.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"yes, indeed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
most glad to make your acquaintance.”This babble was delivered with his head bowed down to the floor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he fell silent, he half-lifted his nut only to find the old man still bent politely flat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Jittering with embarrassment, he promptly lowered his head back onto the floor.The old man, timing it beautifully, lifts his head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“In the old days,” he remarked, “I, too, had a place up here in Tokyo and for many years used to live close to the Shogun’s residence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, when the shogunate collapsed, I left for the country and have, since then, only seldom visited the capital.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I find that things have changed so much that now I cannot even find my way around.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If Waverhouse is not there to help, I’m as good as lost.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Great, great changes.” He shook his head and sighed.“The shogunate, you know, had been established in the castle here for over three hundred years.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”Waverhouse seems to feel that the old man’s observations are taking a tiresome turn, so he quickly interupts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Uncle, though the shogunate was no doubt a very excellent institution, the present government is also to be praised.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the old days, for instance, there was no such thing as the Red Cross, was there?”“No, there wasn’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such things as the Red Cross didn’t exist at all.There are other welcome innovations.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only in this present time has it become possible actually to lay one’s eyes on members of the imperial family.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m lucky to have lived so long and I’m especially fortunate to have attended today’s general meeting of the Red Cross where, with my own two ears, I heard the voice of the Crown Prince.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I die tonight, I shall die a happy man.”“It’s good that, once again, you can see the sights of Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"D’you know, Sneaze, my uncle came up from Shizuoka specially for today’s general meeting of the Red Cross in Ueno, from which we are in fact now on the way home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s because of the meeting that he’s wearing that splendid frock coat that I recently ordered for him at Shirokiya’s.”He is wearing a frock coat all right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not that it fits him anywhere.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The sleeves are too long, the lapels are strained back too far, there’s a dent in the back as big as a pond, and the armpits are too tight.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one tried for a year to make an ill-cut coat, one could not match the mis-shapen marvel on Waverhouse’s uncle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I should add that the old man’s white wing-collar has come adrift from the front stud in his spotless shirt so that, whenever he lifts his head, his Adam’s apple bobbles out between the shirt top and the levitating collar.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
At first I couldn’t be sure whether his black bow tie was fastened around his collar or his flesh.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Moreover, even if one somehow could contrive to overlook the enormities of his coat, his topknot of white hair remains a spectacle of staggering singularity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I notice, too, that his famous iron fan, more precisely his famous iron-ribbed fan, is lying close beside him.My master has now, at last, managed to pull himself together, and I observed that, as he applied the results of his recent mental training to his study of the old man’s garb, he looked distinctly shaken.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He had naturally taken Waverhouse’s stories with several pinches of salt but now, with the old man dumped down before his very eyes, he recognizes that the truth of the man is stronger than any of Waverhouse’s fictions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I could see my master’s thoughts moving behind his cloudy eyes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If my wretched pockmarks, he was thinking, constitute valuable material for historical research, then this old man’s get-up, his topknot and his iron fan, must be of yet more striking value.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master was obviously yearning to pose a thousand questions about the history of the iron fan, but equally obviously believed it would be rude to make a blunt enquiry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He also thought it would be impolite to say nothing, so he asked a question of the uttermost banality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“There must,” he said, “have been a lot of people there?”“Oh, an awful lot of people, and all of them just staring at me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It seems that men have grown too greatly and far too blantantly inquisitive.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the old days of the shogunate, things were very different.”“Quite so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the old days things were not like that at all,” says my master as if he, too, were venerable with years.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To be fair, however, I must assert that, in speaking as he did, my master was not trying to show off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s just that the words came out like that, random fume drifts from the dingy cloud-wastes of his brain.“What’s more, you know, all those people kept gawping at this helmet cracker.”“Your iron fan?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It must be very heavy,” says my master.“Sneaze, you try it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is indeed quite heavy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Uncle, do let him hold it.”Slowly the old man lifts it up and, with a courteous “Please,” hands it to my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He, like some worshiper at the Kurodani Temple who has been allowed briefly to hold the long sword treasured there, holds the iron fan for several minutes and finally says, “Indeed.” Then, reverently, he passed the ancient weapon back to its ancient owner.“People call it an iron fan but actually it’s a helmet cracker.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A thing quite different from an iron fan.”“Ah yes?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And what was it used for?”“For cracking helmets.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And while your enemy is still dazed, you just finish him off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I believe this particular fan was in use as long ago as the early fourteenth century, possibly even by the great General Masashige himself.”“Really, Uncle?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Masashige’s helmet cracker?”“It is not known for certain to whom this beauty belonged.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But it’s certainly an old one.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Probably fangled in 1335.”“It may be quite as ancient as you say, but it surely had that bright young Coldmoon worried.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You know, Sneaze, since we happened today to be passing through the university grounds on our way back from Ueno, I thought it would be pleasant and convenient to drop in at the Science Department.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We asked to be shown around the physics laboratory and, because this helmet cracker happens to be made of iron, every magnetic device in the place went completely crazy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We caused a most almighty stir.”“It couldn’t have been the fan.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s pure iron of the Kemmu period.Iron of superior quality.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Absolutely safe.”“It’s not a question of the quality of the iron.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Any iron would have the same effect.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Coldmoon told me so himself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So let’s not quibble about that.”“Coldmoon?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is that the fellow we found polishing a glass bead?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A sad case, that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For he is very young.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Surely there must be something better he could do.”“Well,” said Waverhouse, “I suppose it is pretty heart-rending, but that’s his speciality and, once he’s got his polishing right, he can look forward to a fine future as a scholar.”“How very extraordinary.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one can become a fine scholar by rubbing away at a glass bead, the road to intellectual eminence must be open to us all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even to me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Indeed the owners of toy shops that sell glass marbles to schoolboys would be particularly well advantaged in the quest for professorships.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You know,” he went on, turning to my master as if seeking the concurrence of that noted academic, “in old Cathay such polishers of stony baubles were known as lapidaries and, I fancy rightly, their standing in the social scale was really rather low.”My master lets his head droop slowly downward in a gesture of respectful assent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Quite so,” he said.“Nowadays all learning seems to be concentrated on the physical sciences which, though there’s superficially nothing wrong with them, are, when it comes to the crunch, totally useless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In the old days it was different.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One trained for the profession of arms at literal risk of one’s life, and one consequently disciplined one’s mind to ensure that in moments of supreme effort or danger one did not lose one’s head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I imagine you would agree that such a training was noticeably more rigorous than buffing up beads or winding wires around an armature.”“Quite so,” my master once again observes with the same air of respect.“Tell me, uncle, that discipline of the mind which you mentioned, wasn’t it a matter, totally different of course from buffing up beads, of sitting around dead still with your hands tucked into your bosom?”“There you go again!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No, the disciplining of the mind was not just a simple matter of sitting still and saying nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
More than two thousand years ago Mencius is said to have impressed upon his pupils that a freed mind must then be returned to examine its liberator’s self.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This wisdom was reiterated, at least in part, by Shao K’ang-chieh, that eminent scholar of the Sung dynasty, who insisted that the highest achievement of human aspiration was the liberated mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He, of course, was a Confucian, but even among the Chinese Buddhists you will find that such worthies as the Zen master Chung Feng have always taught that a steady and devoted mind was all important.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such teachings, as I’m sure you will agree, are by no means easy to understand.”“If you’re asking me,” said Waverhouse, “I’d say they were absolutely incomprehensible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What are the recipients of such teachings supposed to do with it?”“Have you ever read Priest Takuan’s discourses upon Zen doctrines?”“No, I’ve never even heard of him, let alone his book.”“Takuan, who also wrote importantly upon the seasoning of turnips, was basically concerned with the focusing of mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If, he says, one focuses one’s mind upon the movements of an enemy, then the mind will be entrammeled by and subject to such movements.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If upon a foeman’s sword, then mind will be subjected to that sword.Correspondingly, if one’s mind is concentrated upon the thought of wishing to kill an enemy, that thought will dominate all else.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If concentrated upon one’s own sword, then it will become effectively possessed by one’s own sword.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one’s mind centers upon the idea that one does not wish to be killed, then it becomes possessed by that idea.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one’s mind is bent solely upon someone’s posture, then one’s mind will be absorbed to be that posture.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In brief there is nowhere that a mind can be directed without ceasing to be itself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, wherever the mind is, it becomes, by definition, non-existent.”“Quite remarkable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Uncle, you must have astonishing powers of memory to be able to quote such complicated stuff at such impressive length.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, tell me, Sneaze, did you follow the reasoning of that turnip pickling priest?”“Quite so,” replied my master, employing his stock answer to good defensive effect.“But don’t you agree with its truth?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Where indeed should one place one’s mind?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one focuses one’s mind upon the movements of an enemy, then the mind will be entrammeled by and subject to such movements.If upon a foeman’s sword.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Come now, uncle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Mr. Sneaze is already deeply versed in such concepts.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, he’s only just emerged from his study where he was busy training his mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As you may yourself have noticed, he’s getting so regularly to abandon his mind that he wouldn’t even answer the door to a visitor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So don’t worry about Sneaze.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s perfectly all right.”“I’m relieved to hear what you say.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s highly commendable that he should so often go out of his mind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’d do well to do as he does.”Waverhouse giggled, half in horror, half in embarrassment, but then, as ever, rose to the occasion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Alas,” he said, “I haven’t got the time.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just because you, uncle, live in a leisurely style, you shouldn’t assume that others can afford to fritter their hours away.”“But are you not, in truth, idling your life away?”“On the contrary.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I manage to cram busy moments into my leisured life.”“There you go again.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’re a scallywag and a scatterbrain.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s why I keep telling you to discipline your mind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One often hears it said that someone manages to secure odd moments of leisure in a busy life, but I’ve never heard anyone brag of his ability to cram busy moments into his leisured life.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Have you, Mr. Sneaze, ever heard such a thing before?”“I don’t believe I have.”Waverhouse laughed again, this time in genuine amusement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I’d hoped that wouldn’t happen, you two ganging up on me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By the way, uncle,” he immediately continued, “how about having some Tokyo eels?It’s a long time since you tried them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ll stand you a meal at the Chikuyo.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If we take the tram, we can be there in next to no time.”“Eels would be delightful, and that eel restaurant is undoubtedly the best.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unfortunately, however, I have an appointment with Suihara, and indeed I must be off immediately.”“So you’re seeing Mr. Sugihara?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is that old fellow keeping well?”“Not Sugihara—Suihara.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Once again, I catch you in an error, and it’s especially rude to make errors about a person’s name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You should be more careful.”“But it’s written Sugihara.”“It is indeed written Sugihara but it is pronounced Suihara.”“That’s odd.”“Not odd at all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s technically known as a nominal reading.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The common stonechat for instance, is called a wheatear, but its name has nothing to do with either wheat or ears.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The bird is really a kind of sparrow with particularly pallid feathers on its rump.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Its name, in fact, means white arse.”“How extraordinary!”“Similarly, the magpie was originally a maggot pie, not because it had anything to do with either maggots or meat pies, but because this pied, this black-and-white crow, was still earlier named a Margaret pie; just as the sparrow was dubbed Phillip, the redbreast Robin, and some tits Tom.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Margaret and its associated nicknames seem to have been particularly fruitful in this field of linguistics, for it was also from that name that the owl came to be called a madge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So to go around referring to Suihara as Sugihara marks you as a provincial, as much a laughable yokel as someone from the backwoods who still clumps round counting maggot pies for luck.”“All right, all right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I defer to your superior knowledge of patavinities.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if you’re going off to see your old friend, how shall we arrange things?”“If you don’t want to come, you needn’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ll go by myself ”“Can you manage alone?”“I doubt that I could walk so far.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if you would be so kind as to call a rickshaw, I’ll go directly from here.”My master bowed respectfully and quickly arranged for O-san to go and find a rickshaw.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When it arrived, the old man delivered the expectedly long-winded speech of departure and, having settled his bowler hat comfortably over his top-knot, left.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse stayed behind.“So that’s your famous uncle.”“The very one.”“Quite so,” said my master who, reseating himself on a cushion, then sank back into thought with his hands tucked back in his bosom.“Isn’t he an astonishing old fellow?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m lucky to have such an uncle.He carries on like that wherever he goes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You must have been a bit surprised, eh?” Waverhouse evidently likes the idea that my master should have been taken aback.“No, not at all surprised.”“If that old uncle of mine didn’t at least startle you, you must have uncommonly steady nerves.”“It seems to me that there’s something magnificent about your uncle.For instance, one could but admire, admire and deeply respect, his insistence on the necessity of training the mind.”“You think that admirable?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Maybe when you’re well into your sixties, like my uncle, you will be able to afford to be old-fashioned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But for the time being you’d do better to keep your wits about you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’ll do yourself no good if you get yourself known as devoted to old-fashioned notions.”“You worry too much about being considered old-fashioned.Sometimes, in particular cases, being old-fashioned is far more admirable than being up-to-date.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Modern education, for instance, attempts too much, and people, ever grasping for more and more, never once question the wisdom of its limitless spread.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By comparison, a traditional, even an old-fashioned, Oriental education is less aggressive and, by its very passivity, produces a more discriminating taste.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For the traditional education trains the mind itself.” Glibly exact, my master trots out as his own views the twaddle that he has only recently picked up from his philosophizing friend.“This,” said Waverhouse in genuine concern, “is getting serious.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You sound like Singleman Kidd.”At mention of that name a look of real shock came over my master’s face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For the sage philosopher who so recently visited the Cave of the Sleeping Dragon and who, having there converted my master to new styles of thinking, then serenely went upon his way, bore that very name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And Waverhouse had been dead right in his comparison, for my master’s words, solemnly spoken as his own original conclusions, were in fact all straight cribs from Kidd’s unhinging homily.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since my master had not realized that Waverhouse knew Kidd, the speed with which Waverhouse attributed such ideas to their true source reflected unflatteringly on the superficiality of my master’s grasp of them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, my master actually seems bright enough to regard Waverhouse’s comment as a slight upon himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To establish how much Waverhouse really knew, my master point blank asked him, “Have you ever heard him explaining his ideas?”“Have I ever heard him!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That man’s ideas haven’t changed one whit in the long ten years since first I heard them in our own undergraduate days.”“Since truth does not change, perhaps that very lack of variance at which you sneer is, in fact, a point in favor of his theories.”“Oh dear, oh dear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Look, it’s because men like you lend a sympathetic ear to his ravings that he keeps on raving away.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But just consider the man.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His family name suggests that he’s descended from goats, and that straggly beard, a billy’s goatee even in college days, confirms his blood-stock.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And his own name too, is singular beyond the point of simple idiosyncrasy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now let me tell you a story.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One day some years ago he came to visit me and, as usual, lectured me at length on the marvels of his mental training and his consequent passive discipline.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He went on and on.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All the same old tripe and he simply wouldn’t stop talking.Eventually I suggested it was getting late, but he wouldn’t take the hint.He said he didn’t feel at all sleepy and, to my intense annoyance, rattled ever on about his cranky notions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He became so much of a nuisance that I finally told him that, however wakeful he might feel, I was dead tired.I begged and coaxed him to go to bed, and at long last he went.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So far, so good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But in the middle of the night there was a major disturbance.A rat, I’m almost sorry to say, came and bit him on the nose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, although he’d worn my ears off with his repetitive accounts of his spiritual enlightenment, of the way his training had lifted him above all concern with merely mundane matters, as soon as the rat had nipped his nose he displayed a tremendous interest in worldly realities.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He was even worried lest his life should be in danger.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What, he demanded, if the rat’s teeth were infected?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The poison, he whimpered, would be spreading through his system while we wasted time in idle talk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Do something, he pestered me, do something and do it quickly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, I didn’t know what to do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, after racking my brains, I staggered off into the kitchen and pressed some grains of boiled rice onto a piece of paper, and that did the trick.”“How can boiled rice grains cure a rat bite?”“I told him that the gooey mash was an imported ointment recently invented by a famous German doctor and that it had proved an immediate and sovereign cure when applied, in, I think, the State of Hyderabad, to persons fanged by venomous serpents.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Provided you clap this on, your life, I told him from the bottom of my heart, will be entirely safe.”“So even in those early days you had a knack for bamboozlement.”“Well, it set Kidd’s precious mind at rest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The simpleton believed me and dropped off, smiling, into sleepy-byland.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I woke next morning, I was particularly delighted to notice that a trickle from my ointment had dried into a thread and solidified among the darker threads of his daft goatee.”“I see your point.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But he was younger then.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It seems to me that he has matured into a man of serious worth.”“Have you seen him lately?”“He was here about a week ago, and spoke for some long time.”“Ah, that explains why you’ve been so actively brandishing the childish negativities of the Kidd School.”“It so happens that I was much impressed by his ideas, and I am currently considering whether I myself should make the effort demanded by his mental discipline.”“Making an effort is always a good thing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But you’ll only make a fool of yourself if you persist in swallowing every tinseled tale that’s flashed in front of you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The trouble with you is that you believe anything and everything that anyone says.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though Kidd talks loftily about freeing himself from coarse realities by the disciplined power of his mind, the truth is that, in a real crisis, he’d be no different from the rest of us.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You remember that big earthquake about nine years ago?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The only person who jumped from an upstairs window and so broke his leg was your imperturbable Kidd.”“But, as I recall it, he has his own explanation of that incident.”“Of course he has.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And a wonderful explanation naturally it is!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Kidd’s version of that scaredy-cat reality is that the working of the Zen-trained mind is so sharp that, when faced with an emergency, it reacts with the terrifying speed of a bullet fired from a rifle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"While all the others, he says, were fleeing helter-skelter during the earthquake, he simply leapt down from an upstairs window.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This pleased him very much, for it was a proof that his training had resulted in a truly fantastic immediacy of reaction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Kidd was thus pleased but limping.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He refuses to admit defeat.As a matter of fact, you may have noticed that those who make the greatest fuss about the unworldliness bestowed upon them by Zen practices and even by ordinary Buddhism are always the least reliable of men.”“Do you really think so?” asks my master who is patently beginning to wobble.“When Kidd was here the other day I’ll bet he said all sorts of things which you’d only expect from a Zen priest babbling in his sleep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, didn’t he?”“In a way, yes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He emphasized the particular significance of a phrase which went something like, ‘As a Bash of lightning, the sword cuts through the spring wind.’”“That same old flash of lightning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s pitiful to think upon, but that’s been his pet stock phrase throughout the last ten years.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not his own phrase, of course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He lifted it from the sayings of Wu Hsüeh, who thought it up in China more than a thousand years ago.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We even nicknamed Kidd with an appropriate pun on the sound in Japanese of Wu Hsüeh’s Chinese name; and I do assure you that the Reverend No-perception left scarcely one of his fellow lodgers in our student boarding house unstruck by his tedious lightning.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We used to tease him into a frenzy because he then got his patter so properly mixed up that he became quite funny.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘As a flash of spring,’ he would shout at us, ‘the sword cuts through the lightning.’ Try it on him the next time he calls around.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he sits there calmly propounding nonsense, interrupt and contradict him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Keep it up until he gets rattled and in no time at all he’ll start spouting the most amazing balderdash you’ve ever heard.”“Nobody’s safe with a tricky rascal like you around.”“I wonder who, really, is the trickster.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As a rational man, I very much dislike Zen priests and all that riff-raff with their preposterous claims to intuitive enlightenment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Living in a temple near my house there’s an old retired priest, maybe eighty-years-old.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The other day when we had a heavy shower, a thunderbolt fell in the temple yard, where it splintered a pine tree in the old man’s garden.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"People were at pains to tell me how calm, how unperturbed throughout that frightful happening the good, old man had been, how in his spiritual strength he had shown himself serenely indifferent to a terrifying act of nature, which had scared everyone else clean out of their wits.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But I found out later that this spiritual colossus was in fact stone deaf.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Naturally, he wasn’t shaken by the fall of a thunderbolt of which he was totally unaware.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And all too often that’s how it really is.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d have no quarrel with Kidd if he did no more than derange himself in his efforts to find enlightenment, but the trouble is that he goes around involving other people.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I know of at least two persons who, thanks to Kidd, are now stark raving mad.”“Who, for instance?”“Who?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One was Rino Tōzen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thanks to Kidd, he became a fanatic Zen believer, and went to the Zen center at Kamakura and there became a lunatic.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As you may know, there’s a railway crossing in Kamakura right in front of the Engaku Temple.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, one day poor old Rino went and sat down there to do his meditation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He made a thorough nuisance of himself telling everyone not to worry because, such were his spiritual powers, he could bring to a halt any train that dared to approach him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the event, since the train stopped of itself, his stupid life was spared, but he then went around saying that he had a holy body of immortal strength which could neither be burnt with fire nor drowned in water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He actually went so far as to submerge himself in the temple’s lotus pond where he bubbled about below the water for quite some time.”“Did he drown?”“Again he was lucky.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He was hauled out by a student priest who happened to be passing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
After that he returned to Tokyo and eventually died of peritonitis.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is true, as I’ve just said, that he died of peritonitis, but the cause of his sickness was that he ate nothing but boiled barley and pickles throughout his time at the temple.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, though at several removes, it was Kidd who killed him.”“Overenthusiasm is not, it seems, an unmixed blessing,” said my master looking as if he suddenly felt a bit creepy.“Yes, indeed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And there is yet another of my classmates whom Kidd’s meddlesome ministrations brought to an unhappy end.”“How terrible!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Who was that?”“Poor old Pelham Flap.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He, too, was egged on into intemperate enthusiasms by that cranky Kidd, and used to come out with pronouncements such as ‘The eels are going up to Heaven’; in a sense, they eventually did.”“What d’you mean by that?”“Well, he was obsessed by food, the most gluttonous man I’ve ever met.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So when his gluttony became linked with the Zen perversities he learnt from Kidd, there wasn’t much hope for him so far as this world is concerned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At first, we didn’t notice anything, but, now that I come to think back upon it, he was, even from the beginning, given to saying the strangest things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For instance, on one occasion when he was visiting me at home, he warned me somewhat ponderously that beef cutlets might soon be coming to roost in my pine trees.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
On another occasion he mentioned that in the country district where his people lived it was not uncommon for boiled fish-paste to come floating down the river on little wooden boards.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was still all right when he contented himself with mere bizarre remarks, but when one day he urged me to join him in digging for sugared chestnuts and mashed potatoes in a ditch that ran in front of the house, then I reckoned things had gone too far.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A few days later they carted him off to the loony bin at Colney Hatch and he’s been there ever since.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To tell the truth, an earth-bound, greedy pig like Flap wasn’t entitled to rise so high in the spiritual hierarchy as even to qualify to become a lunatic, so l suppose he ought to thank Kidd for that ludicrous measure of advancement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yes, indeed, the influence of Singleman Kidd is quite something.”“Well, well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So Flap is still confined in an asylum?”“Oh yes; he’s very much at home in there.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s now become a megalomaniac, and finds full scope in that institution for the exercise of his latest bent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He recently came to the conclusion that Pelham Flap was an unimpressive name; so, in the conviction that he is an incarnation of Divine Providence, he’s now decided to call himself Mr. Providence Fair.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s really putting on a terrific performance.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You ought to go and see him one of these days.”“Did you say ‘Providence Fair?’”“Yes, that’s his latest moniker.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I must say that, considering he’s a certified lunatic, he’s picked on a clever name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, his fancy is that we are all living in darkness, a condition from which he yearns to rescue us.Accordingly, he fires off enlightening letters to his friends or, in fact, to just anyone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I myself have several of his demented encyclicals.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Some are extremely long, so long that I’ve even found myself obliged to pay postage due.”“Then the letter I’ve just received must have come from this unbalanced Flap!”“Ah, so you’ve heard from him, too.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s odd.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I bet it came in a scarlet envelope.”“Red in the center and white on both sides, a rather unusual looking envelope.”“D’you know, I’m told he has them specially imported from China.The color scheme is supposed to symbolize one of his pottier maxims: that Heaven’s way is white, Earth’s way is white, and that the human way turns red between them.”“I see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even the envelope is pregnant with transcendental meaning.”“Being that of a lunatic, his symbolism is incredibly elaborate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the quaint thing is that, even though he’s gone completely out of his mind, his stomach seems to have maintained its gluttonous appetites.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All his letters somewhere mention food.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Did he refer to food in his letter to you?”“Well, yes, he did say something about sea slugs.”“Quite.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He was very partial to sea slugs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s only natural he still should think about them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Anything else?”“The letter did contain some passing references to blowfish and Korean ginseng.”“That combination is rather clever.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps in his lunatic way he’s trying to advise you to take infusions of ginseng when you poison yourself by eating blowfish.”“I don’t think that was quite what he meant.”“Never mind if he didn’t.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s a lunatic anyway.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Nothing more?”“One thing more.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There was a bit toward the end of his letter where he advised me, most respectfully, to drink tea.”“That’s amusing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Advising you to drink tea, eh?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Pretty tough talk, that, at least when it comes from Flap.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I imagine he sees himself as having snubbed you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well done, Providence Fair!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"!” Goodness knows what Waverhouse finds so funny, but it certainly makes him laugh.My master, having now realized that the writer of that letter which he had read and re-read with such immense respect is a notorious maniac feels distinctly annoyed with himself not least because his recent enthusiasm and his spiritual endeavourings have all been a waste of time.He is also somewhat ashamed of himself for having, after assiduous study of the material, so strongly admired the scribblings of an insane person.And to top off his discomforture, he harbors a sneaking suspicion that anyone so impressed by a madman’s work is himself likely to be not altogether right in the head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He consequently sits there looking decidedly upset in a mixed condition of anger, humiliation and worry.Just at that moment we heard a sound of the entrance door being roughly opened and the sound of heavy boots crunching on the step stone.Then a loud voice shouted, “Hello!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Excuse me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is there anyone at home?”Unlike my sluggish master,Waverhouse is a buoyant person.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Without waiting for O-san to answer the caller, he calls out, “Who is it ?” Up on his feet in a flash, he sweeps through the neighboring anteroom in a couple of strides and disappears into the entrance hall.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The way he comes barging right into someone else’s house without being announced or invited is, of course, annoying, but, once inside, he generally makes himself useful by performing such houseboy functions as answering the door.Still, though Waverhouse does in truth make himself useful, the fact remains that in this house he’s a guest; it is not proper that, when a guest flits out to the entrance hall, the master of the house should just stay sitting, disturbingly undisturbed, on the drawing room floor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Any normal person would at least get up and follow a guest, any guest, out to the entrance hall.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But Mr. Sneaze is and always will be his own obdurate self.Seemingly totally unconcerned, he sits there with his bottom planted on a cushion, but though such steadiness of bottom might be thought to imply some steadiness of nerve, he was inside a simmer of emotions.Waverhouse can be heard conducting an animated conversation at the entrance, but eventually he turns to shout back into the drawing room.“Sneaze,” he yells, “you’re wanted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’ll have to come out here.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Only you can cope with this.”My master sighs in resignation and, his hands still tucked inside his robe, slowly shuffles his way to the entrance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There he finds Waverhouse, holding the visitor’s card in his hand, crouched down in the polite posture for receiving visitors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Seen from the back, however, that posture looks extremely undignified.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The visiting card informs my master that his latest visitor is Police Detective Yoshida Torazo-from the Metropolitan Police Office.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Standing beside Torazo- is a tall young man in his mid-twenties, smartly dressed in a kimono ensemble of fine striped cotton.Quaintly enough, this personable young fellow is like my master in that, similarly silent, he also stands with his hands kept tucked inside his robe.The face strikes me as vaguely familiar and, looking at him a little more closely, I suddenly realize why.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Of course!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s the man who burgled us a short while back and made off with that box of yams.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And here he is again, by broad daylight, standing there as calm as you please, this time, too, at the front entrance.“Sneaze,” says Waverhouse, “this person is a police detective.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He has called specially to tell you that the man who burgled you the other night has now been caught.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So he wants you to come to the police station.”My master seems at last to understand why he is being raided by the police, and accordingly, turning to face the burglar, bows politely.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An understandable mistake, since the burglar looks decidedly more presentable than the detective.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The burglar must have been very surprised but, since he can hardly be expected to identify himself as a burglar, he just stands there calmly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He still keeps his hands buried in the fold of his kimono but, being handcuffed, he cannot take his hands out even if he wants to.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Any sensible person could correctly interpret the situation by the appearances of the individuals concerned but my master, out of touch with modern trends, still makes much too much of officials and the police.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He thinks the power of the authorities is really terrifying.Though he is just capable of grasping that, in theory at least, policemen and other such creatures are no more than watchmen employed by us and paid by us, in actual practice he is ready to drop on his hands and knees at the first sight of a uniform.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master’s father, the headman of a district on the outskirts of some minor town, quickly developed the ugly habit of creeping to his superiors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps as an act of divine justice, his son was born with that cringing streak which one can but notice in my master’s character.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I find this very pitiful.The police detective must have had a sense of humor, for he was grinning when he said, “Please be at the Nihonzatsumi police substation tomorrow morning at nine o’clock.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Would you also please tell me precisely what goods were stolen from you?”“The stolen goods,” my master promptly responded, “consisted of.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”but having forgotten most of them, his voice petered out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All he could remember was that ridiculous box of yams.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He didn’t really care about the yams, but he thought he would look silly and undignified if having started to identify the property stolen, he suddenly had to stop dead.After all, it was he who had been burgled, and he was conscious of a certain responsibility deriving from his burgled status.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he could not give a precise answer to the policeman’s question, he would feel himself to be somehow less than a man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, with sturdy resolution, he completed his sentence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“The stolen goods,” he said, “consisted of a box of yams.”The burglar seemed to think this answer was terribly funny, for he looked down and buried his chin in his kimono collar.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Waverhouse was less restrained and burst into hoots of laughter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I see,” he squawked, “the yams were really precious, eh?”Only the policeman looked at all serious.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I don’t think you’ll recover the yams,” he said, “but most of the other things will be returned.Anyway, you can find out about all that at the station tomorrow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, we shall need a receipt for everything you repossess, so don’t forget to bring your personal seal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You must arrive no later than nine in the morning at the aforementioned substation, which lies within the jurisdiction of the Asakusa Police Office.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, goodbye.” His mission completed, the policeman walked out of the front door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The burglar followed him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since he couldn’t take his hands out of his kimono, the burglar couldn’t close the door behind him, so after he’d gone, it just stood open.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though my master had conducted himself throughout the incident with awe-filled diffidence towards the police, he seemed annoyed by that parting rudeness: for, looking unpleasantly sullen, he closed the door with a vicious sliding slam.“Well, well,” said Waverhouse, “you do seem awed by detectives.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I only wish you’d always behave with such remarkable diffidence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’d be a marvel of good manners.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the trouble with you is that you’re civil only to coppers.”“But he’d come a long way out of his way to bring me that good news.”“It’s his job to come and tell you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There was no need whatsoever to treat him as anyone special.”“But his is not just any ordinary job.”“Of course it’s not an ordinary job.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s a disgusting job called ‘being a detective.’ An occupation lower and dirtier than any ordinary job.”“If you talk like that, you’ll land yourself in trouble.”Waverhouse snorted disrespectfully.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Very well then,” he grunted,“I’ll lay off slandering detectives.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, you know, it’s not really a matter of respecting or not respecting those insufferable sneakers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What really is shocking is this business of being respectful to burglars.”“Who showed respect to a burglar?”“You did.”“How could I conceivably number a burglar among my friends?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quite impossible!”“Impossible, is it?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But you actually bowed to a burglar.”“When?”“Just now, you bowed down like a hoop before him.”“Don’t be silly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That was the detective.”“Detectives don’t wear clothes like that.”“But can’t you see, it’s precisely because he is a detective that he disguises himself in clothes like that.”“You’re being very pig-headed.”“It’s you who’s being very pig-headed.”“Now do just think.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To start with, when a detective visits someone, do you honestly imagine he will just stand there with his hands in his robes?”“Are you suggesting detectives are incapable of keeping their hands in their robes?”“If you get so fierce, I’ll simply have to break this conversation off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But think, man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"While you were bowing to him, didn’t he just stand there?”“Not surprising if he did.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After all, he is a detective.”“What glorious self-assurance!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’re totally deaf to reason, aren’t you?”“No, I’m not.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You keep saying that fellow was a burglar, but you didn’t actually see him committing burglary.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You just imagine he did so, and you’re being extraordinary obstinate about it.”It was at this point that Waverhouse abandoned hope and accepted my master as dim beyond redemption.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He fell unwontedly silent.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, interpreting that silence as an admission of defeat, looks uncommonly pleased with himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But in proportion to my master’s self-elation, Waverhouse’s assessment of the wretched man has dropped.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In Waverhouse’s view my master’s fat-headed obstinacy has considerably lowered his value as a man.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But in my master’s view his firmness of mind has, by a corresponding amount, lifted him above the level of such pifflers as poor Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such topsy-turveydoms are not unusual in this imperfect world.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A man who sees himself as magnified by his display of determination is, in fact, dimnished in the public estimation by that demonstration of his crass willfulness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The strange thing is that, to his dying day, the mulish bigot regards his dull opiniatrety as somehow meritorious, a characteristic worthy to be honored.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He never realizes that he has made himself a despised laughing stock, and that sensible people want nothing more to do with him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He has, in fact, achieved happiness.I understand that such joy, the wallowing well-being of a pig in its sty, is even called pig’s happiness.“Anyway,” said Waverhouse, “do you intend to go to the copper shop tomorrow?”“Of course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve been asked to be there by nine o’clock, so I’ll leave the house at eight.”“What about school?”“I’ll take a day off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That school—who cares!” retorts my master with almost venomous vigor.“My, my!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What a roaring boy we have become, and all of a sudden too!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But will it really be all right to take the day off?”“Of course it’ll be all right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My salary’s paid on a monthly basis, so there’s no danger of them deducting a day’s wages.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s quite safe.” There is, of course, something unpleasantly sly in these remarks, but the very frankness of his comments reveals that my master is more simple than dishonest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though he is, alas, both.“Fine.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But do you know how to get there?”“Why should I know the way to a police station?” My master is clearly narked.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“But it will presumably be quite easy to get there by rickshaw.”“Your knowledge of Tokyo seems no better than that of my uncle from the provinces.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I give up.”“You’re welcome.”Waverhouse responded to this petty spitefulness with another burst of laughter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Don’t you realize that the police station you’ll be visiting is not in any ordinary district.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s down in Yoshiwara.”“Where?”“In Yoshiwara.”“You mean in the red light district?”“That’s right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s only one Yoshiwara in Tokyo.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, now do you still want to go?”Waverhouse starts teasing him again.On realizing that Yoshiwara meant the Yoshiwara, my master flinched and seemed to hesitate, but, quickly thinking it over, he decided to put on a quite unnecessarily bold front.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Wherever it may be, red light district or not, I’ve said I’ll go, so go I will.” In circumstances of this kind any fool is like to prove pig-headed.Waverhouse, unimpressed, coolly remarked, “It may prove interesting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You really ought to see that place.”The ructions caused by the detective incident died away, and, in the subsequent conversation,Waverhouse displayed his inexhaustible gift for amusing banter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When it began to grow dark, he got up and, explaining that his uncle would be annoyed if he stayed out unduly late, took his departure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After he’d gone, my master downed a hurried dinner and withdrew to the study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There, again with his arms close-folded, he started to muse aloud.“According to Waverhouse, Singleman Kidd, whom I admired and whose example I very much wanted to follow, is not in truth a person worthy of imitation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the contrary, the theory he advocates seems sadly lacking in common sense and, as Waverhouse insists, contains features that strongly suggest lunacy, a suggestion which appears all the more well founded when one remembers that two of Kidd’s most enthusiastic disciples are incontrovertibly mad.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
An extremely dangerous situation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I become too much involved with him, I myself am liable to be regarded as unbalanced.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s more, that Providence Fair fellow, whose writings really impressed me so much that I believed him to be a great man with enormous depths of knowledge and insight, has turned out to be an unadulterated certified maniac, confined, under his real name of Pelham Flap, in a well-known lunatic asylum.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even allowing for the probability that Waverhouse’s portrait of the unfortunate fellow is a distorted caricature, it still seems likely that he’s having a high, old time in that loony bin under the impression that he’s superintending Heaven.Am I, perhaps, myself a little potty?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They say that birds of a feather flock together and that like attracts like.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If those old sayings are true, my admiration of a loony’s thinking, well, let’s say my generous sympathy for his writings, suggest that I myself must be a borderline case at least.Even if I’m not yet clearly certifiable, if I freely choose to live next door to a madman, there’s an obvious risk that one fine day I might, perhaps unwittingly, topple across into his demented territory and end up, like my neighbor, completely around the bend.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What a terrifying prospect!Now that I come to think of it, I confess that I’ve been more than a little surprised at the very peculiar way in which my brain has recently been functioning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps some spoonful of my brain cells has suffered a chemical change.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even if nothing like that has happened, it’s still true that, of my own free will, I’ve been doing and saying immoderate things, things that lack balance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I don’t feel, yet, anything queer on my tongue or under my armpits, but what’s this maddening smell at the roots of my teeth, these crazy muscular tics?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This is no longer a joke.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps I’ve already gone stark staring mad, and it’s only because I’ve been lucky enough not to have hurt anybody or to have become an obvious public nuisance that I’m still allowed to quietly live on in this district as a private citizen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This is indeed no time to be fooling about with negatives and positives, passive or active training of the mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First of all, let’s check my heart rate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My pulse seems normal.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is my brow fevered?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No, temperature normal; no sign there of any rush of blood to the brain.Even so, I’m still not satisfied there’s nothing wrong.”For a little while my master sat in worried silence, straining his wits about what strains his wits could bear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, after a few anxious minutes, his mumblings started up again.“I’ve been comparing myself solely with lunatics, concentrating on the similarities between deranged persons and myself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That way I shall never escape from the atmosphere of lunacy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Obviously, I’ve tackled the problem in the wrong way.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve been accepting lunacy as the norm, and I’ve been measuring myself by the wonky standards of insanity.Inevitably, I’ve been coming to lunatic conclusions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If instead, I now start measuring myself by the normal standards of a healthy person, perhaps I’ll come to happier results.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Let me then start by comparing myself to those close to me, those whom I know best.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First, what about that old uncle in a frock coat who came visiting today?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But wasn’t it he who kept demanding where one should place one’s mind?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I doubt if he could really be counted as normal.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Secondly then, what about Coldmoon?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s so mad on polishing glass beads that, for fear lest lunch should deprive him of one moment’s friction, he hoiks a lunchbox down to the laboratory.Hardly normal either.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thirdly, Waverhouse?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That man thinks his only function in life is to go around rollicking everywhere.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Such a madcap must be a completely positive kind of lunatic.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Fourthly, the wife of that man Goldfield.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Her disposition is so totally poisonous as to leave no nook for common sense.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I conclude that she also must be stark staring mad.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Fifthly, Goldfield himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though I haven’t had the pleasure of meeting him, it is obvious that he must be less than normal because he has achieved conjugal harmony by conforming with the warped characteristics of so abnormal a woman.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such a degree of conformity with the abnormal amounts to lunacy, so he’s as bad as she.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Who else?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, there are those charming little gentlemen from Cloud Descending Hall.Though they are still mere sprouts, their raving madness could very easily disrupt the entire universe.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They’re mad as young March hares, the whole boiling lot of them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, as I review the list of my friends and acquaintances, most of them emerge as stained with maniac stigmata of one sort or another.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
l begin to feel considerably reassured.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The truth may simply be that human society is no more than a massing of lunatics.Perhaps our vaunted social organization is merely a kind of bear-garden, where lunatics gather together, grapple desperately, bicker and tussle with each other, call each other filthy names, tumble and sprawl all over each other in mindless muckiness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This agglomeration of lunatics thus becomes a living organism which, like cells, disintegrates and coalesces, crumbles again to nothing and again reintegrates.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is that not the actual nature of our marvelous human society?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And within that organism, such few cells as are slightly sensible and exhibit symptoms of discretion inevitably prove a nuisance to the rest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So they find themselves confined in specially constructed lunatic asylums.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would follow that, objectively speaking, those locked up in mental homes are sane, while those careering around outside the walls are all as mad as hatters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An individual lunatic, so long as he’s kept isolated, can be treated as a lunatic, but when lunatics get together and, so massed, acquire the strength of numbers, they also automatically acquire the sanity of numbers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Many lunatics are, by their maniness, healthy persons.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is not uncommon that a powerful lunatic, abusing the authority of his wealth and with myriad minor madmen in his pay, behaves outrageously, but is nevertheless honored and praised by all and sundry as a paragon of human virtue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I just don’t understand anything any more.”I have not altered a word of my master’s sad soliloquies as he sat there, all that evening, deep in twitchless meditation, under the forlorn light of his solitary lamp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If further evidence were needed, his drooling words confirm the dullness of his brain.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though he sports a fine moustache like Kaiser Bill, he is so preternaturally stupid that he can’t even distinguish between a madman and a normal person.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not only that, but after he has given himself the heartache and excruciating mental torment of considering lunacy as an intellectual problem, he finishes up by dropping the matter without reaching any conclusion whatsoever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He lacks the brain power to think through a problem.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Any problem.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In any field.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s a poor old blithering mutt.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The only thing worth noting about the whole of his evening’s performance is that, characteristically, his conclusions are as vague and as elusive as the grayish cigarette smoke leaking from his nostrils.I am a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Some of you may wonder how a mere cat can analyze his master’s thoughts with the detailed acumen which I have just displayed.Such a feat is a mere nothing for a cat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quite apart from the precision of my hearing and the complexity of my mind, I can also read thoughts.Don’t ask me how I learned that skill.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My methods are none of your business.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The plain fact remains that when, apparently sleeping on a human lap, I gently rub my fur against his tummy, a beam of electricity is thereby generated, and down that beam into my mind’s eye every detail of his innermost reflections is reflected.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Only the other day, for instance, my master, while gently stroking my head, suddenly permitted himself to entertain the atrocious notion that, if he skinned this snoozing moggy and had its pelt made up into a waistcoat, how warm, how wonderfully warm, that Kittish Warm would be.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I at once sensed what he was thinking, and felt an icy chill creep over me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was quite horrible.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, it is this extrasensory gift which has enabled me to tell you not only what my master said but even what he thought throughout this dreary evening.But, as you now must know, he’s a pretty feeble specimen of his unperceptive kind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he’d got as far as telling himself that he just doesn’t understand anything any more, his energies were exhausted and he dropped off into sleep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sure as eggs are eggs, when he wakes tomorrow he’ll have forgotten everything he’s just been thinking, even why he thought it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If the matter of lunacy ever again occurs to him, he’ll have to start anew, right from scratch.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if that ever does happen, I cannot guarantee that his thinking will follow the same lines in order to arrive at the conclusion that he just doesn’t understand anything any more.However, no matter how often he ponders these problems, no matter how many lines of thought he develops, one thing I can guarantee with absolute assurance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I give you my feline word that he will invariably conclude, just before dropping asleep, with an admission that he just doesn’t understand anything any more.IIIMY DEAR, it’s seven already,” his wife called out from the other side of the sliding door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is difficult to say whether my master is awake or asleep: he lies facing away from me and makes no answer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, of course, his habit not to give answers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he absolutely has to open his mouth, he says, “Hmm.” Even this non-committal noise does not easily emerge.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When a man becomes so lazy that he finds it a nuisance even to give an answer, he often acquires a certain curiously individual tanginess; a certain personal spice which, however, is never appreciated by women.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even his life partner, the less-than-fussy Mrs. Sneaze, seems to set low store upon her husband; so one can readily imagine what the rest of the world thinks about him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s a popular song which asks, “How can a fellow shunned by both his parents and his brothers possibly be loved by some tart who’s a perfect stranger?” How, then, can a man found unattractive even by his own wife expect to be favored by ladies in general?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There is, of course, no call upon me to go out of my way gratuitously to expose my master as a creature repulsive to females of his own kind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I cannot just sit by while he cultivates illusions, blurring reality with such nitwitted notions as the happy thought that it is only some unlucky disposition of their stars which pre-ordains his wife’s dislike of him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is thus purely my kind-hearted anxiety to help my master to see the world as it really is, to realize his own reality, which has induced me to provide the foregoing account of his sexual repulsiveness.Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sneaze is under strict instructions to rouse him at a set time.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, when that time arrives, she tells him so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he chooses to disregard her call, offering not even his normal subhuman “Hmm” of an acknowledgement, that, she concludes, is his affair.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let him lump the consequences.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With an eloquent gesture disclaiming all responsibility if her husband proves late for his appointment, she goes off into the study with her broom in her hand and a dust cloth slung lightly over her shoulder.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Soon I heard sounds of the duster flap-flapping all over the study.The daily housework has begun.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, since it is not my job to clean rooms, I naturally do not know if doing a room is a form of fun or a means of taking exercise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s certainly no concern of mine, but I cannot forbear to comment that this woman’s method of cleaning is totally pointless—unless, that is, she goes through the motions of cleaning for their own ritualistic sake.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Her idea of doing a room is to flip the duster curtly over the paper surfaces of the sliding doors and let the broom glide once along the floor.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
With respect to these activities she shows no interest whatsoever in any possible relation of cause and effect.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As a result, the clean places are always clean, while dusty spots and grimy corners remain eternally dusty and begrimed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, as Confucius pointed out when rebuking a disciple who proposed abandonment of the wasteful and senseless practice of sacrificing a sheep on the first day of every month, a meaningless gesture of courtesy is better than no courtesy at all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It may be that Mrs. Sneaze’s style of cleaning a room should be recognized as minimally better than doing nothing at all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, her activities bring my master no benefit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, day after day, she takes the trouble to perform her pointless rite.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which is, alas, the sole redeeming feature.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mrs. Sneaze and room cleaning are, by the custom of many years, firmly linked in a mechanical association; however, their combination has in practice achieved no more actual cleaning than in those old days before she was born and in those even older days before brooms and dusters had been invented.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One might indeed say that the relation between Mrs. Sneaze and the cleaning of rooms resembles that of certain terms in formal logic which, totally unrelated in their nature, are nevertheless formally linked.Unlike my master, I am an early riser, so by this time I was already feeling distinctly peckish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There is, of course, no question of a mere cat expecting to get its breakfast before the human members of the household had sat themselves down at the table.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet I remain a cat, with all a cat’s pure appetites and instincts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And once I had begun to wonder if there could possibly be a delicious smell of soup drifting out of that abalone shell, which serves as my feeding platter, I was simply unable to remain still.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When, knowing its hopelessness, one yet hopes on against hope, it is always wisest to concentrate on thinking about that hope and to discipline oneself into silent immobility.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But it’s easier said than done.One cannot help wanting to check whether one’s hope has, or has not, been fulfilled in reality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even when it is absolutely certain that a check must bring disappointment, one’s mind will not stop fidgeting until it has been fully and finally disappointed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I could no longer hold myself in check and accordingly crept out to investigate the kitchen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First, I peep into my abalone shell in its usual place behind the kitchen furnace.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sure enough, the shell is empty, just as it was last night after I’d licked it clean.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This morning, that shell looks singularly desolate, chillily reflecting the weird glow of the autumn sunlight filtering down through the skylight.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
O-san has already transferred the boiled rice into the serving container and is now stirring soup in the saucepan on the stove.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Rice-rich liquid that had boiled over in the cooking-pot has dried into hard streaks, some of them looking like stuck-on strips of high-class paper, down the sides of the pot.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since both rice and soup are now ready, I thought my own breakfast should be served at once.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s silly to be backward at such times and, even if I don’t succeed in getting what I want, I shan’t lose anything by trying.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After all, even a hanger-on is as much entitled as anyone else to feel the pangs of hunger; so why shouldn’t I call out for my breakfast?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First I tried a coaxing kind of mew; an appealing, even a mildly reproachful, noise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
O-san does not take the slightest notice.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since she was born polygonal, I am perfectly well aware that her heart is as cold as a clock, but I am counting on my mewing skills to move her rusty sympathies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Next I tried my most pitiable miaowing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I believe this voice of entreaty has a tone so pathetic in its loneliness that it should make a wanderer in a strange land feel that his heart is being torn in pieces.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
O-san ignores it completely.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can this woman actually be deaf?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Hardly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For were she deaf, she’d not be able to hold down her job as a maidservant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps she is deaf only to cat voices.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I understand that there are persons who are colorblind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though such persons may think their eyesight perfect, from the medical point of view they are in fact deformed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This O-san creature could be voice blind, and persons so deformed are no less freaks than their colorblind homologues.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For a mere monstrosity, she’s a jolly sight too lordly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Take the nights, for instance, however hard I plead with her that I need to go outside, never once has she opened the door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If by some perversion of her character she should once let me out, there’s not a wax cat’s chance in hell that she’d ever let me in again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even in summer, the night dew is bad for one’s health, and winter frost is naturally much worse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You can’t imagine the agony of staying awake under the eaves and waiting for the sun to rise.The other evening when I chanced to be shut out, some foul stray dog attacked me and only by the skin of my teeth did I manage to escape onto the roof of the tool shed, there to shiver the whole long night away.All such evil hours are brought upon me by the endless wintriness of that hard woman’s heart.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I know well enough that from such a person my miaowing performance will evoke no kindness, but just as in the proverb a hungry man will turn to God, a man in want will turn to robbery and a lovelorn loon will take to writing songs, so in my extremity will I try anything once.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, in a last attempt to catch her attention, my third effort was an especially intricate interweaving of mews and muted yowling, which, though, at least in my unshakable judgement, a music no less moving than that of Beethoven, produces no effect whatsoever within that implacable creature’s unsociably savage breast.Suddenly, O-san sinks down to her knees and, sliding out a removable floorboard, extracts from the cavity below a stick of charcoal roughly four inches long.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Rapped sharply against the corner of the stove, the length broke into some three main pieces and the surrounding area was liberally showered with black dust.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A plentiful powdering of charcoal seems to have been added to the soup, but O-san is not the kind of woman to be bothered by such trifles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She quickly shoved the three main pieces under the bottom of the saucepan and so into the stove.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I see little prospect of her interrupting her sullen chores to give ear to my symphony.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, that’s the way it is.Dejected, I set off back to the living room and, as I passed by the bathroom door, I noticed that my master’s three small daughters were there busily engaged in washing their faces.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though I say they were washing their faces, the two older girls are still at the kindergarten stage, while the youngest is so tiny that she cannot even trail along with her sisters to their place of schooling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It follows that not one of them can yet properly wash her face or make herself presentable.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The baby, having hauled a tangle of damp floor rags out of the mop bucket, is happily using it to stroke her face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I would have thought it most unpleasant to wash one’s face with floor rags, but one cannot be surprised at any oddness in this child who regularly responds to earthquakes with outcries of pure joy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which may, of course, only demonstrate that she is a more enlightened being than Singleman Kidd.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now the eldest girl takes the responsibilities of her seniority with expectedly officious seriousness.Accordingly, she drops her gargling cup and starts trying to part her baby sister from the latter’s precious floor rags.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Baby-dear,” she tells her, “that’s for wiping floors.”But Baby-dear, a self-opinionated tot, is not so easily persuaded and, with a piercing shout of “No, babu,” she tugs at the floor-cloth which her sister has just grabbed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nobody knows what “babu” means or how its use originated, but Baby-dear lets fly with it whenever she loses her temper.As the children tug at the ends of that sodden rag, water squeezed from its center portion starts pitilessly dripping down on Baby-dear’s twee tooters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Were it only a matter of wet feet, that would be no great shakes, but soon her knees are also sopping wet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Baby-dear is wearing a backhammon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve been trying to find out the meaning of that word, and it would seem that to the children it signifies any kind of pattern, in this case patterned clothing, of a medium size.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Where they got this information, alas, I could not say.“Baby-dear,” the eldest girl is saying, “your backhammon’s getting wet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Be a good baby, Baby-dear, and let go of this cloth.”This is remarkably intelligent advice, especially from a girl who herself until just recently thought backhammon was a kind of game.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which reminds me that this eldest girl is constantly misusing words and that her malapropisms not infrequently amuse her adult listeners.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The other day she remarked that cornflakes were sparking up from the fire and again, when being dosed with castor oil, asked whether the medicine had been squeezed from the brother of bollocks.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She once haughtily announced that she was no common plum child, and it was several days before I discovered that she was in fact bragging that she’d not been born in some back slum.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master sniggers whenever he hears such errors, but I’m prepared to bet that when he’s teaching English in his school, he makes in sober earnest far sillier mistakes than his daughter ever does.Baby-dear, who incidentally always refers to herself as Baby-beer, at last notices that her backhammon is now soaking wet and, bawling out that “Baby-beer’s backhammon is got cold,” begins to howl her head off.Of course, a cold backhammon is a pretty serious matter, so here comes O-san running from the kitchen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quickly she dispossesses the squabbling children of their treasured floor rag and cleans the baby up.Throughout the hullaballoo, the second daughter, Sunko, has remained suspiciously quiet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Standing with her back toward us, she has got hold of a small jar of her mother’s cosmetic which has tumbled off its shelf and is now busy plastering white paste on her face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First, having poked her finger into the jar, she drags a broad white line down the length of her nose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which at least makes it easier to see where her nose is.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Next, with her finger liberally reloaded, she daubs thick blobs on her cheeks and rubs the stuff around until two white lumps are sticking out from her face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Her beautifying self-adornment had reached this interesting stage when O-san bustled up to deal with Baby-dear.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Once Baby-dear was set to rights, Sunko, too, was wiped back into human semblance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She emerged from the white paste looking distinctly peeved.Leaving this distressing scene behind me, I moved through the living room to inspect my master’s bedroom and so to ascertain whether or not he has at last got up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Stealthily I squinny into the room, but my master’s head is nowhere to be seen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Instead, one large and high-arched sole is sticking out from the bottom end of the old-fashioned sleeved bed quilt.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He seems to have burrowed down to avoid the unpleasantness of being woken up.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He looks, in fact, like a not too clever tortoise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At this point Mrs. Sneaze, who had finished cleaning the study, returned to the bedroom with her broom and duster shouldered.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Halting at the entrance, she called out as before, “Haven’t you got up yet?” then stood there for a while, gazing in disgust at the lump of headless bedding.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As before, her question brought no answer.Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sneaze advanced a short way into the room.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Planting her broom upright with a slightly menacing plunk, she pressed again for an answer.“Not yet woken up, dear?”This time, my master is awake all right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, it is precisely because he is awake that he is now, head and body tucked well down, entrenched within the bedclothes against the expected onslaught from his wife.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He seems to be relying on some silly notion that, so long as he keeps his head concealed, his wife may fail to notice that he’s still snugged down in bed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She shows no disposition to let him off so slightly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her first call, reckoned my master, had come from the threshold, so there should still be a reasonably safe distance, perhaps as much as six feet, between himself and her.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He was consequently shaken when the plunk of her grounded broom-haft came from less than three feet off.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Worse still, her solicitous, “Not yet woken up, dear?” sounded, even under the bedclothes, twice more menacing than before.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Seeing no hope for it, my master thereupon surrendered, and his small voice answered, “Hmm.”“You said you’d be there by nine o’clock.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hurry up, or you’ll be late.”“You don’t have to tell me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m getting up,” replied my master with his face spectacularly visible through the cuff of one sleeve of the bedclothes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His wife is used to this old trick.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Once he has managed to convince her that he’s going to get up, he usually goes straight back to sleep again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So she’s learnt to keep a sharp eye on his morning gambits and therefore answers his mumbled promises with a curt, “Well, get up now.” It’s annoying, when one’s said one’s getting up, to be told then to get up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For a selfish man like my master, it is even more than annoying.In one wild, angry gesture, he thrusts aside the pile of bedclothes that he’s been keeping over his head, and I note that his eyes are staringly wide-open.“Don’t make all that fuss.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I say I’m getting up, then I’m getting up.”“But you always say you’re getting up, and then you never do.”“Nonsense!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When have I ever told a ridiculous lie like that?”“Why, always.”“Don’t be so silly.”“Who are you calling silly?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Answer me that.” She looks quite dashingly militant as she stands there beside the bed with her broomstick planted like a spear shaft.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But at this very moment,Yatchan, the child of the rickshawman who lives in the street behind us, suddenly burst out crying with a most tremendous, “Waa!” That Yatchan should start crying as soon as my master gets angry is the responsibility of his ghastly mother.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For the wife of the rickshawman is paid to make her baby scream every time my master gets into a fury.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which is fine for the money grubbing mother, but pretty hard on Yatchan.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With a mother like that, a child could well have cause to cry around the clock.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If my master realized the way things have been rigged and made the little effort needed to control himself, then Yatchan might live longer than seems likely.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even though the victim’s mother is being handsomely rewarded by the Goldfields for her torturing of her child, only a person far more dangerously mad than Providence Fair would do such a lunatic thing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Were Yatchan only made to cry on the occasions of my master’s anger, he could probably survive, but every time that Goldfield’s hireling hooligans come shouting round the house, then too the wretched infant is hurt until he screams.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is taken for granted that the hooligan catcalls will infuriate my master; so, whether or not my master does flare up,Yatchan catches hell in expectation of my master’s anger.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Every vulgar yell asserting that my master is a terracotta badger is thus invariably matched by a heart-felt yell from Yatchan.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, it has become difficult to distinguish between Yatchan and my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is simple to start my master off by indirect approaches.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One only needs to torment Yatchan briefly to produce the same effect on my master as slapping him directly in the face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I understand that years ago in Europe whenever a condemned criminal escaped to a foreign land and could not be recaptured, it was the custom to fashion a simulacrum of the fugitive which was then burnt in his stead.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Among these hooligans of Goldfield’s there seems to be a tactician well acquainted with such ancient European practices, and I must confess he’s certainly worked out some very clever ploys.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Both the little louts from Cloud Descending Hall and Yatchan’s mother represent real problems for my master who, when all is said and done, is a man of limited abilities.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There are many other equally awkward customers to be coped with.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One might even say that, from my master’s point of view, the entire district is populated with awkward customers; since these others are not immediately relevant to this story, I’ll introduce them later as developments require.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For the moment, I will return you to my master quarreling in the bedroom with his wife.On hearing Yatchan cry and at such an early hour, my master must have felt really angry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He jerked sharply up into a sitting position among the bedclothes, for at times of such stress no years of mental training, not even the presence of Singleman Kidd himself, could exercise the least restraint.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then with both hands he began to scratch his scalp with such vicious violence that nearly every square inch of its skin was clawed away.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A month’s accumulated dandruff came floating down to settle nastily on his neck and pajama collar.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is a sight not easily forgotten.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Yet another shock greeted my wondering eyes when they fell upon his bristling moustache.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps that ragged growth felt it would be less than seemly to be calm when its owner was so savagely distraught but, whatever the reason, each individual hair has gone completely berserk and, forgetting all sense of co-operation in the frightful vigor of their self-expression, the various hairs are jutting out like the bayonets of ill-trained conscripts in whichever wild direction takes their frantic fancy.This, too, constitutes a sight not easily forgotten.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Only yesterday, out of regard for the bathroom mirror and in deference to the German Emperor, these hairs had obediently mustered themselves into disciplined formation, but after no more than a single night’s repose all the benefits of their training have been scattered to the winds.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Each separate conscript hair has reverted to its aboriginal nature and has resumed that individuality which reduces the moustache to the condition of a rabble.The same sad process of rapid degeneration may be observed in my master.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the space of a single night his mental training loses all effect, and his inborn boorishness comes bristling back into view through every pore in his skin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When one pauses to wonder how such a wildly whiskered tusker has managed to keep his job as a teacher, then for the first time one grasps the varied vastness of Japan.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, only a land of such true enormity could find room for Goldfield and his pack of snooping curs and rabid bitches to pass themselves off as human beings.My master seems to believe that in a society where those monstrosities can indeed pass for human, there is no conceivable reason why his own modest eccentricities should lead to his dismissal.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the last analysis one could always obtain an enlightening explanation of the whole crazy set-up by sending a postcard of enquiry to that noble pile which shelters Providence Fair.At this point my master opened his ancient eyes, whose drifting cloudiness I have previously described in detail, as wide as they can stretch and, with an unaccustomedly sharp dance, stared at the cupboard in the wall that faced him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This cupboard is about six feet in height, divided horizontally into top and bottom halves, each half having two sliding paper-doors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The bottom end of my master’s bedclothes reached almost to the lower part of the cupboard so that, having just sat up, he cannot help but focus, as soon as his lids are lifted, on the picture-painted paper of the cupboard’s sliding doors.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Here and there the paper skin has peeled or been torn away, and the curious underlayers, the flattened intestines of the panels, are distinctly visible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
These innards are of many different sorts.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Some are printed papers, others are handwritten; some have been pasted face-side in, others upside-down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The sight of this displayed anatomy of paper stirred in my master a sudden urge to read what was written there.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The fact that my master, who until but a moment ago was so frenetically incensed that he could happily have grabbed the wife of the rickshawman and ground her nose against a pine tree, now suddenly wishes to read old scraps of paper may seem a little strange, but actually such conduct is not all that unusual in an extrovert so easily entered.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is another version of the squalling baby who starts to coo as soon as he is given sweets.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Years ago in his student days, when my master lodged in a temple, there were five or six nuns living in the room next to his with nothing but the sliding paper-doors between them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, nuns are by nature the cattiest of all cat-natured women.These nuns seem quickly to have perceived the true and inmost character of my master, for they made it their practice to chant, tapping out the rhythm on the rim of their cooking-pot, that jingle parents use to tease a child about its changeable moods:The little crow that cried and criedHas grown a grin six inches wide.My master, I’ve been told, has loathed nuns ever since.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They may well be detestable, but their chanting told a truth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For, though none of his moods is lasting, my master contrives to weep, to laugh, to rollick, and be downcast more frequently than anyone else in the world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Putting it kindly, one might say he shows a certain lack of tenacity and is inclined to change his mind for insufficient reason.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Translated into simple everyday language, that merely means that my master is a shallow, stubborn, spoiled brat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, being a spoiled brat, it’s not at all surprising that, full of fighting spirit, he should jerk his torso fiercely up from the bed and then, balanced on his bottom, suddenly change his mind and begin to read the flattened intestines of a damaged cupboard door.The first thing he noticed was a photograph of Itō Hirobumi standing on his head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By twisting his neck to study the date associated with this irreverently pasted picture, my master found it to be September 28, 1878.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, even as long as twenty-seven years ago, the present Resident-General in Korea was already doing somersaults.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Wondering how the Resident-General might have occupied himself before Korea was available to reside in, my master crooks himself sufficiently to decipher “Finance Minister.” This certainly is a great man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even when he’s standing on his head, he’s a Finance Minister.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A bit to the left of that information, the Minister again appears.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This time he is lying down, having a siesta.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which is very understandable.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One cannot be expected to stand on one’s head for any protracted period.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Near the bottom of the exposed area, the two words “You are” can be seen written in large ideographs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master naturally wanted to read the rest of such an aggressively sized sentence but, alas, nothing more was visible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of the next line down, all that can be read is “quickly” and, once again, there’s no clue to the rest of the text.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If my master were a detective of the Metropolitan Police Board, he might have satisfied his curiosity by ripping off the rest of the top layer of paper even though the cupboard door, its skin and its intestines, all belonged to somebody else.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since no detective has been properly educated, such barbarous persons will do anything to sate their lust for facts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which is a lamentable state of affairs.I wish they would behave with a little more civilized reserve.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Matters would be improved if a rule were established that all facts should be withheld from detectives whose conduct lacks reserve.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I understand that these disreputable servants of the public sometimes arrest innocent citizens on the basis of false accusations and manufactured evidence.That public servants, employed and paid for by honest citizens, should be given scope to pin crimes on those who pay and employ them is yet another example of the lunatic condition of human society.My master next studies the center part of the exposed paper where a map of Oita Prefecture has been pasted upside-down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since the Resident-General in Korea is standing on his head, it’s not surprising that Oita Prefecture should join him in his somersaults.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When my master’s eyes had taken in the overthrow of Oita, he clenched both hands and thrust his fists on high toward the ceiling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
These mantic gestures foretell a coming yawn.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His yawning, too, is signally abnormal: less a human yawn than the yowling of a whale.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That performance over, my master pulled some clothes on and lurched off into the bathroom for a wash. His wife, who had been impatiently waiting for this moment, quickly gathered up the quilt, folded it and put the bedclothes in the cupboard.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, as usual, she began to clean the room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as Mrs.Sneaze’s cleaning system has become a stylized drill, so too over the years her husband has established a routine pattern for washing his face.I think I earlier mentioned his noisy morning gargling, its variations of bass and treble bubblement, and today he’s doing it as usual.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Finally, having made the usual careful parting in his hair, he appeared in the living room with a hand towel draped across one shoulder.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There, with a lordly air, he sat himself down beside the oblong brazier.Mention of that object may lead some of you to imagine an oblong brazier made from fine zelkova wood.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Some perhaps may picture a brazier of black persimmon wood, its inner sides entirely copper plated, against the lip of which a sexy-looking charmer with long and freshly washed tresses, sitting with one knee raised, seductively taps out her long slim tobacco pipe.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But poor old Sneaze’s brazier is sadly less than picturesque.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, in fact, so ancient that none but an expert could guess what wood was used to make it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The fine point about any such oblong brazier is the quality and brilliance of the gloss acquired by years of patient polishing, but this brazier is not only undetermined as to its material, which could as well be cherry as zelkova and paulownia as cherry, but has never once been polished.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is consequently a gloomy and most repellent object.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Where, I wonder, could he have gotten it?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He would certainly not have bought it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Could it, then, have been a present?Not that I’ve ever heard.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which leaves us with the possibility that he stole it, and at this point all histories of the brazier become a little vague.Many years ago, among my master’s relatives there was an old, old man.When that ancient died, my master was asked to live in the dead man’s house and just look after it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Some years later when my master moved out to occupy his own, new house, he simply took along with him, possibly unthinkingly, the oblong brazier which he had used so often that he had come to regard it as his personal property.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Usufruct decaying into usucaption, which sounds a little wicked.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, when one considers the matter, his act was certainly wrong.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, such happenings are common enough.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For instance, I understand that bankers grow so accustomed to handling other people’s money that they come to regard it as their own.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Similarly, public officials are the servants of the people and can reasonably be regarded as agents to whom the people have entrusted certain powers to be exercised on the people’s behalf in the running of public affairs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But as these officials grow accustomed to their daily control of affairs, they begin to acquire delusions of grandeur, act as though the authority they exercise was in fact their own and treat the people as though the people had no say in the matter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since the world is thus demonstrably full of such usurpers, one cannot brand my master as a thief just because of this business with the oblong brazier.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, if you insist that he has a thievish disposition, an evidenced inclination to theft, then the plain fact is that he shares that criminal cant with everyone else in the world.I had got as far as saying that my master sat down beside the oblong brazier, but I have not yet explained that, in doing so, he was in fact seating himself at the dining table.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Seated around the other three sides and already tucking into their breakfasts were Baby-dear, who cleans her face with floor rags;Tonko, whose learning includes the starry phenomena of Castor and Bollocks; and sweet little Sunko, who pokes about into make-up jars.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master looks at his three daughters with impartial distaste.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Tonko’s face is flat and round like the steel guard on some old-fashioned sword.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sunko takes after her elder sister so far as face shape is concerned, but its color immediately puts me in mind of those round red lacquer trays from Okinawa.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Baby-dear’s face is the odd one out, and very odd it is: long and square at the corners, with the long sides of the oblong stretching sideways.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of themselves, oblong heads are not uncommon but in such cases the greater length is vertical.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An oblong head like Baby-dear’s, horizontally long, is, I think, unheard of.However vertiginous the variance of fashion, I cannot believe that a square face squashed out sideways will ever prove the rage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master suffers random spasms of concern about his growing daughters.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Their growth is unpreventable, and they are certainly all growing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, the speed of their growth reminds one of the sheer blue force of a bamboo shoot accelerating into sapling size in the garden of some Zen-purveying temple.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every time my master notices an increase in his children’s size, he becomes as nervous as if an inexorable pursuer were catching up behind him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though an inordinately vague person, my master does realize that these three daughters are all females.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He also understands that, being females, proper arrangements for their disposition must be made.He understands, yes, but that is all, for he further realizes that he is quite incapable of getting them married off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Therefore, though they are indeed his very own offspring, he finds them more than he cares for.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he’s the kind of father who finds his children a bit too much, then he should never have produced them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But such behavior is all too typically human.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is painfully easy to define human beings.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They are beings who, for no good reason at all, create their own unnecessary suffering.But children are terrific.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not even dreaming that their father is thus worried stiff about what to do with them, they go on eating happily.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The only unmanageable one is Baby-dear.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Baby-dear is now nearly three-years-old, so her mother, seeking to be kind, has provided for her mealtime use a pair of chopsticks and a rice bowl, all of size appropriate to her age.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But Baby-dear will have none of it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First she grabs her eldest sister’s chopsticks, then her rice bowl.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though they are too large for her, she struggles to control these quite unmanageable things.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One finds in this sad world that among mean-spirited persons, the greater their incompetence and inefficiency, the sharper their sense of self-importance and the more virulent their ambition to occupy unsuitably high official posts.This style of character always begins to develop at the stage now reached by Baby-dear; and, since the roots of these defects of character run down so deeply into babyhood, wise persons quickly resign themselves to the wretched truth that no subsequent discipline or education can eradicate such flaws.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Baby-dear positively wallows in her tiny tyrannies, refusing to surrender the enormous rice bowl and the hefty chopsticks that she’s looted from her sister.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps, since she is seeking by sheer violence to control objects far too big for her to handle, she has no choice but to play the tyrant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, she begins by clamping both chopsticks tight together in a firm grip applied too far down toward their lower ends.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She then rams this wooden wedge into the bottom of the rice bowl, which is about four-fifths full of rice topped up to its brim with bean-paste soup.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The rice bowl had managed, somewhat precariously, to retain its balance throughout Baby-dear’s initial raid but, as soon as it felt the force of her chopstick battering ram, it tilted some thirty degrees out of the true and poured a sluice of still-hot soup all down the front of its assailant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But Baby-dear is not to be daunted by such a petty setback.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For Baby-dear’s a tyrant.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, she yanks the chopsticks savagely out of the bowl, shoves her rosebud mouth right up against the rice bowl’s lip, and then proceeds to shovel masses of soggy rice into her slurping maw.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Grains that escape her wild style of engulfment joined the soup in its bid for freedom and, with a happy shout, alighted variously on her nose tip, on her cheeks, and on her chin.Those, and they were many, that missed their human target finished up on different parts of the floor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This is a most reckless manner in which to eat rice.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I respectfully advise all persons in positions of power, including that infamous Goldfield fellow, that if they persist in treating people with the same crude violence that Baby-dear applies to the rice bowl and the chopsticks, they too will finish up with only a spattering of rice grains in their mouths.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The only grains that will, in fact, land up in their gullets will not be those on whom pressure has been applied, but merely those that have lost all sense of direction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I do most earnestly entreat all persons of influence to reflect deeply upon this matter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Men who are truly wise in this world never act so stupidly.The eldest girl, her bowl and chopsticks snitched by the baby, has been obliged to make do with Baby-dear’s dwarf versions, but the baby’s bowl can hold so little rice that three quick mouthfuls empty it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Forced into frequent replenishments, she has already downed her fourth helping and is apparently going to take a fifth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She lifts the lid of the rice-container and, holding the broad rice scoop momentarily poised, stares at the bunkered grains as though undecided whether or not to help herself to more.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In the end she plumps for another bowlful and carefully scoops out a dollop of rice that looks unburnt.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So far, so good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, as she brought the laden scoop up toward the rim of her bowl, she accidentally banged the two together, with the result that a largish lump of rice fell down onto the floor.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Looking not the least put out, she began to pick it up again with almost finicking care.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Naturally, I wondered what she was going to do with it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She put it all, every single grain, back into the container.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which seems a dirty thing to do.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The conclusion of this ugly business came at the same moment as the climax of Baby-dear’s performance with the shoveling chopsticks.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And an eldest sister can hardly be expected to overlook a face as foully spattered with rice as Baby-dear’s.“Baby-dear, you look terrible with your face all covered in rice.” She begins to clean up the mess.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First, she disengaged the rice grain sticking on the baby’s nose but, instead of throwing it away, popped it, much to my surprised disgust, into her own mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Next she tackles the cheeks.Here the grains, some twenty altogether, are clotted in scattered groups.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One by one, her eldest sister picked the kernels off the baby’s cheeks, and one by one she ate them.At this point, the middle sister, Sunko, who hitherto has demurely busied herself with crunching pickled radish, suddenly scooped from her brimming soup bowl a broken gobbet of sweet potato and slung that wretched object straight into her widely opened mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As my readers are no doubt aware, nothing can sear the mouth more painfully than sweet potato cooked in bean-paste soup.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unless very careful, even a hardened adult can give himself a truly nasty burn.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is thus understandable that a mere beginner in the art of eating such sweet potatoes should feel scorched, as certainly did Sunko, out of her tiny mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With a fearful squawking, “Waa,” she spat the burning gobbet out upon the table.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This slightly mangled object skidded across the table surface, coming at last to rest within convenient grabbing distance of Baby-dear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now Baby-dear, as tough-mouthed as a carthorse, just dotes on sweet potatoes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Seeing her favorite goody skid to a steaming halt only a hand’s stretch from her rice-stripped face, she pitched away her chopsticks, snatched the sweet potato and gobbled it gladly down.My master, a fully conscious witness of all these ghastly happenings, watches them as dispassionately as if they were occurring on some other planet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Without saying a word, he has quietly got on with eating his own rice and soup, and is now engaged in probing his jaws with a toothpick.He seems to be following a policy of complete non-intervention, even of masterly inactivity, in the rearing of his daughters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One fine day in the not too distant future this trio of bright college girls may be fated to find themselves wild lovers with whom, for the sake of passion, they’ll run away from home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If that in fact should happen, I expect that, calmly continuing to eat his rice and soup, my master will just watch them as they go upon their ways.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is certainly a man of little resource, but I’ve noticed that those who are nowadays regarded as most admirably resourceful know nothing, in fact, except how to deceive their fellows with lies, how to sneak up upon the unwary, how to jump queues, how to create a sensation by bluffing, and by what tricks to ensnare the simple-minded.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even boys at the middle school level, influenced by such conduct, get the idea that only by such means can they expect to make their way in the world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed they seem to think that they can only become fine gentlemen by the successful perpetration of acts of which they ought, in truth, to be thoroughly ashamed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, these imitative loutlings do not display resource, and are in fact no more than hooligans.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being a Japanese cat, I have a certain amount of patriotic sentiment and, every time I see these allegedly resourceful creatures I wish I had the chance to give them a right, good hiding.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Each new creature of that type weakens the nation to the degree of his presence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such students are a disgrace to their school, and such adults a disgrace to their country.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nonetheless, disgraceful as they are, there are lots of them about.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which is really inexplicable.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The human beings in Japan, shamefully enough, seem less mettlesome than the cats.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One must admit that, compared with hooligans, my master is a very superior model of humankind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He is superior because he is weak-minded.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His very uselessness makes him their superior.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is their clear superior because he is not smart.Having thus uneventfully, and with a show of no resource whatever, finished his breakfast, my master put on his suit, climbed into a rickshaw and left to keep his appointment with the police.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As he climbed aboard, he’d asked the rickshawman if he knew the location of Nihon-zutsumi.The rickshawman just grinned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I thought it rather silly of my master to make a point of reminding the rickshawman that his destination lay in the brothel quarter.After my master’s unusual departure—unusual, that is, because he left in a rickshaw—Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sneaze had her own breakfast and then started nagging at the children.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Hurry up,” she says, “or you’ll be late for school.”But the children pay no heed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“There isn’t,” they answer back, “any school today,” and they make no effort to get themselves ready.“Of course there is,” she snaps in a lecturing tone of voice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Hurry and get ready.”“But yesterday the teacher said, ‘We have no school tomorrow,’” the eldest girl persists.It was probably at this point that Mrs. Sneaze began to suspect that the children might be right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She went to the cupboard, lifted out a calendar and checked the date.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Today is marked in red, the sign of a national holiday.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I fancy that my master was unaware of this fact when he sent a note to his school advising them of his absence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I fancy, too, that Mrs.Sneaze was similarly unaware when she put his note in the post.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As for Waverhouse, I can’t make up my mind whether he, too, was unaware or whether he simply found it diverting to keep quiet.Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze, surprised and softened by this discovery, told the children to go out and play.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“But please,” she bade them, “just behave yourselves.”She then settled down, as she daily does, to get on with her sewing.For the next half hour peace reigned throughout the house, and nothing happened worth my bother to record.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, out of the blue, an unexpected visitor arrived: a young girl, student aged, I would guess, perhaps seventeen or eighteen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The heels of her shoes had worn crooked and her long, purple skirt trailed along the ground.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her hair was quaintly dressed in two big bulges above the ears, so that her head resembled an abacus bead.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unannounced, she walked in through the kitchen entrance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This apparition is my master’s niece.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They say she is a student.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She’s always liable to drop in on a Sunday, and she usually contrives to have some kind of row with her uncle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This young lady possesses the unusually beautiful name of Yukie but, far from reminding its viewers of a snowy river, her ruddy features are of that dull normality which you can see in any street if you take the trouble to walk a hundred yards.“Hullo, Auntie!” she casually remarked as, marching straight into the living room, she plonked herself down beside the sewing box.“My dear, how early you are.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Because today’s a national holiday.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I thought I’d come and see you in the morning, so I left home in a hurry about half past eight.”“Oh?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For anything special?”“No, but I haven’t seen you for such a long time, and I just wanted to say hullo.”“Well then, don’t just say hullo but stay for a bit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Your uncle will soon be back.”“Has Uncle gone out already?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That’s unusual!”“Yes, and today he’s gone to rather an unusual place.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, to a police station.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Isn’t that odd?”“Whatever for?”“They’ve caught the man who burgled us last spring.”“And Uncle’s got to give evidence?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a bore.”“Not altogether.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We’re going to get our things back.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The stolen articles have turned up and we’ve been asked to go and collect them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A policeman came around yesterday especially to tell us.”“I see.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Otherwise Uncle wouldn’t have gone out as early as this.Normally he’d still be snoring.”“There’s no one quite such a lie-abed as your uncle, and if one wakes him up he gets extremely cross.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This morning, for instance, because he’d asked me to wake him up at seven, that’s when I woke him up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And d’you know, he promptly crept inside the bed clothes and didn’t even answer.Naturally, I was worried about his appointment with the police, but when I tried to wake him up for the second time, he said something rather unkind through a sleeve of the padded bed clothes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, he’s the limit.”“I wonder why he’s always so sleepy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps,” said his niece in almost pleasured tones, “his nerves are shot to pieces.”“I don’t know, I’m sure.”“He does lose his temper far too easily.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It surprises me that they keep him on as a teacher at that school.”“Well, I’m told he’s awfully gentle at the school.”“Which only makes things worse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A blow-hard in the house and all thistledown at school.”“What d’you mean, dear?” asks my mistress.“Well, don’t you think it’s bad that he should act around here like the King of Hell and then appear at school like some quaking jelly?”“And of course it’s not just that he’s so terribly bad tempered.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s also an ornery man.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When one says right, he immediately says left; if one says left, then he says right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And he never, but never, does anything that he’s been asked to do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s as stubborn and crank-minded as a mule.”“Cantankerous, I call it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being plain contrary is his whole-time hobby.For myself if I ever want him to do something, I just ask him to do the opposite.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And it always works.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For instance, the other day I wanted him to buy me an umbrella.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So I purposely kept on telling him that I didn’t want one.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘Of course you want an umbrella,’ he exploded and promptly went and bought me one.”Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sneaze broke out in a womanly series of giggles and titters.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Oh, how clever you are,” she said, “I’ll do the same in future.”“You certainly should.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’ll never get anything out of that old skin-flint if you don’t.”“The other day an insurance man called around and he tried hard to persuade your uncle to take out an insurance policy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He pointed out this and that advantage and did his very best for about an hour to talk your uncle around.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But your obstinate, old uncle was not to be persuaded, even though we have three children and no savings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If only he would take out even the most modest insurance, we’d naturally all feel very much more secure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But a fat lot he cares for things like that.”“Quite so.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If anything should happen, you could be very awkwardly placed.” This girl doesn’t sound like a teenager at all, but more, and most unbecomingly, like an experience-hardened housewife.“It was really rather amusing to hear your uncle arguing with that wretched salesman.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Your uncle said,‘All right, perhaps I can concede the necessity of insurance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I deduce that it is by reason of that necessity that insurance companies exist.’Nevertheless he persisted in maintaining that ‘nobody needs to get insured unless he’s going to die.’”“Did he actually say that?”“He did indeed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Inevitably, the salesman answered, ‘Of course, if nobody ever died, there’d be no need for insurance companies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But human life, however durable it may sometimes seem, is in fact a fragile and precarious thing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No man can ever know what hidden dangers menace his tenuous existence.’ To which your uncle retorted, ‘I’ve decided not to die, so have no worry on my account.’ Can you imagine anyone actually saying such an idiotic thing?”“How extremely silly!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
One dies even if one decides not to.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why, I myself was absolutely determined to pass my exams, but, in fact, I failed.”“The insurance man said the same thing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘Life,’ he said, ‘can’t be controlled.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If people could prolong their lives by strength of resolution, nobody anywhere would ever leave this earth.’”“The insurance man makes sense to me.”“I certainly agree.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But your uncle cannot see it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He swears he’ll never die.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘I’ve made a vow,’ he told that salesman with all the pride of a nincompoop, ‘never, never to die.’”“How very odd.”“Of course he’s odd, very odd indeed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He looks entirely unconcerned as he announces that, rather than paying premiums for insurance, he prefers to hold his savings in a bank.”“Has he got any savings?”“Of course not.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He just doesn’t give a damn what happens after his death.”“That’s very worrisome for you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I wonder what makes him so peculiar.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s no one like him among his friends who come here, is there?”“Of course there’s not.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s unique.”“You should ask someone like Suzuki to give him a talking-to.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If only he were as mild and manageable as Suzuki, he would be so much easier to cope with.”“I understand what you mean, but Mr. Suzuki is not well thought of in this house.”“Everything here seems upside-down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, if that’s no good, what about that other person, that person of such singular self-possession?”“Singleman Kidd?”“Yes, him.”“Your uncle recognizes Singleman’s superiority, but only yesterday we had Waverhouse around here with some dreadful tales to tell of Singleman’s behavior and past history.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the circumstances, I don’t think Singleman could be much help.”“But surely he could do it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s so generously self-possessed, such a winning personality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The other day he gave a lecture at my school.”“Singleman did?”“Yes.”“Does he teach at your school?”“No, he’s not one of our teachers, but we invited him to give a lecture to our Women’s Society for the Protection of Female Virtue.”“Was it interesting?”“Well, not all that interesting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But he has such a long face and he sports such a spiritual goatee, so everyone who hears him is naturally much impressed.”“What sort of things did he talk about?” Mrs. Sneaze had barely finished her sentence when the three children, presumably drawn by the sound of Yukie’s voice, came bursting noisily across the veranda and into the living room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I imagine they had been playing outside in the open space just beyond the bamboo fence.“Hurray, it’s Yukie,” shouted the two elder girls with boisterous pleasure.“Don’t get so excited, children,” said Mrs. Sneaze.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Come and sit down quietly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yukie is going to tell us an interesting story.” So saying, she shoved her sewing things away into a corner of the room.“A story from Yukie?” says the eldest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Oh, I do love stories.”“Will you be telling us again that tale of Click-Clack Mountain?” asks the second daughter.“Baby-dear a story!” shouts the baby as she rams her knee forward between her squatting sisters.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This does not mean that she wants to listen to a story.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the contrary, it means she wants to tell one.“What!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Baby-dear’s story yet again!” scream her laughing sisters.“Baby-dear, you shall tell us your story afterward,” says Mrs. Sneaze cajolingly, “after Yukie has finished.”But Baby-dear is in no mood for sops or compromises.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“No,” she bellows, “now!” And to establish that she’s totally in earnest, she adds her gnomic warning of a tantrum.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Babu,” she thundered.“All right, all right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Baby-dear shall start,” says Yukie placatingly.“What’s your story called?”“‘Bo-tan, Bo-tan, where you going?’”“Very good, and what next?”“I go rice field, I cut rice”“Aren’t you a clever one!”“If you tum there, rice go rotten”“Hey, it’s not ‘tum there,’ it’s ‘if you come there.’” One of the girls butts in with a correction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The baby responds with her threatening roar of “Babu,” and her interrupting sister immediately subsides.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the interruption has broken the baby’s train of remembrance so that, stuck for words, she sits there in a glowering silence.“Baby-dear, is that all?” asks Yukie at her sweetest.The baby pondered for a moment and then exclaimed, “Don’t want fart-fart, that not nice.”There was a burst of unseemly laughter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“What a dreadful thing to say!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whoever’s been teaching you that?”“O-san,” says the treacherous brat with an undisarming smirk.“How naughty of O-san to say such things,” says Mrs. Sneaze with a forced smile.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quickly ending the matter, she turned to her niece.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Now, it’s time for Yukie’s story.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’ll listen to her, won’t you, Baby-dear?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yes?”Tyrant though she is, the baby now seems to be satisfied, for she remained quiet.“Professor Singleman’s lecture went like this,” Yukie began at last.“Once upon a time a big stone image of the guardian god of children stood smack in the middle of the place where two roads crossed.Unfortunately, it was a very busy place with lots of carts and horses moving along the roads.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So this big stone Jizō, interfering with the flow of traffic, was really an awful nuisance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The people who lived in that district therefore got together and decided that the best thing to do would be to move the big stone image to one corner of the crossroads.”“Is this a story of something that actually happened?” asks Mrs.Sneaze.“I don’t know.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The Professor did not mention whether the tale was real or not.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, it seems that the people then began to discuss how the statue could in fact be moved.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The strongest man amongst them told them not to worry, for he could easily do the job.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So off he went to the crossroads, stripped himself to the waist and pushed and pulled at the big stone image until the sweat poured down his body.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the Jizō did not move.”“It must have been made of terribly heavy stone.”“Indeed it was.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So terribly heavy that in the end that strongest man of them all was totally exhausted and trudged back home to sleep.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So the people had another meeting and talked it over again.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This time it was the smartest man amongst them who said, ‘Let me have a go at it,’ so they let him have a go.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He filled a box with sweet dumplings and put it down on the ground a little way in front of the Jizō.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘Jizō,’ he said, pointing to the dumpling box,‘come along here.’ For he reckoned that the big stone fellow would be greedy enough to be lured forward in order to get at the goodies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the Jizō did not move.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though the clever man could see no flaw in his style of approach, he calculated that he must have misjudged the appetites of Jizō.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So he went away and filled a gourd with saké and then came back to the crossroads with the drink-filled gourd in one hand and a saké cup in the other.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For about three hours he tried to tease the Jizō into moving.‘Don’t you want this lovely saké?’ he kept shouting.‘If you want it, come and get it!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Come and drink this lovely saké.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just a step and the gourd’s all yours.’ But the Jizō did not move.”“Yukie,” asks the eldest daughter, “doesn’t Mr. Jizō ever get hungry?”“I’d do almost anything,” observed her younger sister, “for a boxful of sweet dumplings.”“For the second time the clever man got nowhere.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So he went away again and made hundreds and hundreds of imitation banknotes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Standing in front of the big stone god, he flashed his fancy money in and out of his pocket.‘I’ll bet you’d like a fistful of these bank notes,’ he remarked,‘so why not come and get them?’ But even the flashing of bank notes did no good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The Jizō did not move.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He must, I think, have been quite an obstinate Jizō.”“Rather like your uncle,” said Mrs. Sneaze with a sniff.“Indeed so, the very image of my uncle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, in the end the clever man also gave up in disgust.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At which point along came a braggart who assured the people that their problem was the simplest thing in the world and that he would certainly settle it for them.”“So what did the braggart do?”“Well, it was all very amusing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First, he rigged himself out in a policeman’s uniform and a false moustache.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then he marched up to the big stone image and addressed it in a loud and pompous voice.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘You there,’ he bellowed,‘move along now, quietly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you don’t move on, you’ll find yourself in trouble.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The authorities will certainly purpose the matter with the utmost rigor.’ This must all have happened long ago,” said Yukie by way of comment, “for I doubt whether nowadays you could impress anyone by pretending to be a policeman.”“Quite.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But did that old-time Jizō move?”“Of course it didn’t.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was just like Uncle.”“But your uncle stands very much in awe of the police.”“Really?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, if the Jizō wasn’t scared by the braggart’s threatenings, they couldn’t have been particularly frightening.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, the Jizō was unimpressed and stayed where it was.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The braggart then grew deucedly angry.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He stormed off home, took off his copper’s uniform, pitched his false moustache into a rubbish bin and reappeared at the crossroads got up to look like an extremely wealthy man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, he contorted his face to resemble the features of Baron Iwasaki.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Can you imagine anything quite so potty?”“What sort of face is Baron Iwasaki’s?”“Well, probably very proud.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Toffee-nosed, you know.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, saying nothing more, but puffing a vast cigar, the braggart took no further action but to walk around and around the Jizō.”“Whatever for?”“The idea was to make the Jizō dizzy with tobacco smoke.”“It all sounds like some storyteller’s joke!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Did he succeed in dizzying the Jizō?”“No, the idea didn’t work.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After all, he was puffing against stone.Then, instead of just abandoning his pantomimes, he next appeared disguised as a prince.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What about that?”“As a prince?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Did they have princes even in those days?”“They must have, for Professor Kidd said so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He said that, blasphemous as it was, this braggart actually appeared in the trappings of a prince.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I really think such conduct most irreverent.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And the man nothing but a boastful twerp!”“You say he appeared as a prince, but as which prince?”“I don’t know.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whichever prince it was, the act remains irreverent.”“How right you are.”“Well, even princely power proved useless.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, finally stumped, the braggart threw his hand in and admitted he could do nothing with the Jizō.”“Served him right!”“Yes indeed, and, what’s more, he ought to have been jailed for his impudence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, the people in the town were now really worried, but though they got together for a further pow-wow, no one could be persuaded to take another crack at the problem.”“Is that how it all finished?”“No, there’s more to come.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the end, they paid whole gangs of rickshawmen and other riff-raff to mill around the Jizō with as much hullaballoo as possible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The idea was to make things so unbearably unpleasant that the Jizō would move on.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, taking it in turns, they managed to keep up an incredible din by day and night.”“What a painful business!”“But even such desperate measures brought no joy, for the Jizō, too, was stubborn.”“So what happened?” asks Tonko eagerly.“Well, by now everyone was getting pretty fed up because, though they kept the racket going for days and nights on end, the din had no effect.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Only the riff-raff and the rickshawmen enjoyed the row they made, and they of course were happy because they were getting wages for making themselves a nuisance.”“What,” asked Sunko, “are wages?”“Wages are money.”“What would they do with money?”Yukie was flummoxed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Well, when they have money.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.” she began and then dodged the question first by a loud false laugh and then by telling Sunko how naughty she was.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Anyway,” she continued, “the people just went on making their silly noises all through the day and all through the night.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now it so happened that at that time there was an idiot boy in the district whom they all called Daft Bamboo.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He was, as the saying goes, simple.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He knew nothing, and nobody had anything to do with him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Eventually, even this simpleton noticed the terrible racket.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘Why,’ he asked ‘are you making all that noise?’ When someone explained the situation, the idiot boy remarked, ‘What idiots you are, trying for all these years to shift a single Jizō with such idiotic tricks.’”“A remarkable speech from an idiot.’”“He was indeed a rather remarkable fool.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course nobody thought he could do any good but, since no one else had done better, why not, they said, why not let him have a go at it?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So Daft Bamboo was asked to help.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He immediately agreed.‘Stop that horrible noise,’ he said,‘and just keep quiet.’ The riff-raff and the rickshawmen were packed off somewhere out of sight, and Daft Bamboo, as vacuous as ever, then walked up to the Jizō with utter aimlessness.”“Was Utter Aimlessness a special friend of Daft Bamboo?”Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze and Yukie burst into laughter at Tonko’s curious question.“No, not a friend.”“Then, what?”“Well, utter aimlessness is.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"impossible to describe.”“‘Utter aimlessness’ means ‘impossible to describe’?”“No, that’s not it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Utter aimlessness means.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Yes?”“You know Mr. Sampei, don’t you?”“Yes, he’s the one who gave us yams.”“Well, utter aimlessness means someone like Mr. Sampei.”“Is Mr. Sampei an utter aimlessness?”“Yes, more or less.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, Daft Bamboo ambled up to the Jizō with his hands in his pockets and said, ‘Mr.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Jizō, the people in this town would like you to move.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Would you be so kind as to do so?’ And the Jizō promptly replied,‘Of course I’ll do so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Why ever didn’t they come and ask before?’With that he slowly moved away to a corner of the crossroads.”“What a peculiar statue!”“Then the lecture started.”“Oh!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is there more to come?”“Most certainly.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Professor Kidd went on to say that he had opened his address to the women’s meeting with that particular story because it illustrated a point he had in mind.‘If I may take the liberty of saying so,’he said, ‘whenever women do something, they are prone to tackle it in a roundabout way instead of coming straight to the point.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Admittedly, it is not solely women who beat about the bush.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In these so-called enlightened days, debilitated by the poisons of Western civilization, even men have become somewhat effeminate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There are, alas, all too many now devoting their time and effort to an imitation of Western customs in the totally mistaken conviction that aping foreigners is the proper occupation of a gentleman.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such persons are, of course, deformed, for, by their efforts to conform with alien ways, they deform themselves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They deserve no further comment.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, I would wish you ladies to reflect upon the tale I’ve told today so that, as occasion may arise, you, too, will act with the same clear-hearted honesty as was shown by Daft Bamboo.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For if all ladies did so act, there can be no doubt that one-third of the abominable discords between husbands and wives and between wives and their mothers-in-law would simply disappear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Human beings are, alas, so made that the more they indulge in secret schemes, schemes whose very secrecy breeds evil, the deeper they drive the wellsprings of their own unhappiness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And the specific reason why so many ladies are so much less happy than the average man is precisely because ladies over indulge themselves in secret schemes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Please,’ he begged us as his lecture ended, ‘turn yourselves into Daft Bamboos.’”“Did he, indeed!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well,Yukie, are you planning to follow his advice?”“No fear!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Turn myself into a Daft Bamboo!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s the last thing I would do.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Miss Goldfield, too, she was very angry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She said the lecture was damned rude.”“Miss Goldfield?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The girl who lives just round the corner?”“Yes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Little Miss Popinjay in person.”“Does she go to the same school as you,Yukie?”“No, she just came to hear the lecture because it was a Women’s Society meeting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She certainly dresses up to the nines.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Really astonishing.”“They say she’s very good looking.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is it true?”“She’s nothing special, in my opinion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Certainly not the knock-out that she fancies herself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Almost any girl would look good under that much make-up.”“So if you,Yukie, daubed on the same amount of make-up, you’d look twice as pretty as she does?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Right?”“What a thing to say!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But truly, Auntie, she puts on far too much.Rich she may be, but really she overdoes it.”“Well, it’s pleasant to be rich, even if one does consequently overdo the paints and powder.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Wouldn’t you agree?”“Yes, perhaps you’re right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if anyone needs to take lessons from Daft Bamboo, that Goldfield girl’s the one.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She is so terribly stuck-up.Only the other day she was swanking to all the other girls that some poet or other had just dedicated to her a collection of his new-style poetry.”“That was probably Mr. Beauchamp.”“Really?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He must be a bit flighty.”“Oh no, Mr. Beauchamp is very sober-minded man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He would think such a gesture the most natural thing in the world.”“A man like that shouldn’t be allowed to.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Actually there is another amusing thing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It seems that somebody recently sent her a love letter.”“How disgusting!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whoever did such a thing?”“Apparently nobody knows who sent it.”“Wasn’t there a name?”“It was signed, but with a name that no one’s ever heard of.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And it was a very, very long letter, about a yard long, full of the weirdest things.For instance, it said, ‘I love you in the same way that a saintly man loves God.’ It said, ‘Gladly for your sake would I die like a lamb sacrificed on the altar; for me, so to be slaughtered would be the greatest of all honors.’ It said, ‘My heart is shaped like a triangle in the center of which, like a bull’s eye pierced by a blowgun dart, is Cupid’s arrow stuck!’”“Is all that meant to be serious?”“It would seem to be.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Three of my own friends have actually seen the letter.”“I do think she’s awful to go around showing people such a letter.Since she intends to marry Mr. Coldmoon, she could get into trouble if that sort of story begins to get around.”“On the contrary, she’d be terribly pleased if everyone should know about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m sure she’d say you’d be welcome to pass the news to Mr.Coldmoon when next he pays a visit.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I don’t suppose he’s heard about it yet.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Or do you think he has?”“Probably not, since he spends his entire time polishing little glass beads at the university.”“I wonder if Mr. Coldmoon really intends to marry that girl.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Poor man!”“Why?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
With all her money she’ll be of real help to him on some rainy day in the future.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So why should you think he’s doing badly?”“Auntie, you are so vulgar, always talking about money, money, money.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Surely love is more important than money.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Without love no real relation between husband and wife is possible.”“Indeed?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then tell me, Yukie, what sort of man do you intend to marry?”“How should I know?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve no one in mind.”Though she had hardly understood a word of what was being said, my master’s eldest daughter had listened attentively while her mother and Cousin Yukie launched out upon their earnest discussion of the question of marriage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But suddenly, out of the blue, the little girl opened her mouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I,” she announced, “would also like to get married.” Though Yukie is herself so brimming with youthful ardor that she could well be expected to sympathize with Tonko’s feelings, she was in fact struck dumb by such reckless lust.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mrs. Sneaze, however, took it all in her stride and, smiling at her daughter, simply asked, “To whom?”“Well, shall I tell you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I want to marry Yasukuni Shrine.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I don’t like crossing Suido- Bridge, so I’m wondering what to do.”Both Mrs. Sneaze and Yukie were distinctly taken aback by this unexpected declaration of an ambition to marry the shrine dedicated to the departed spirits of those who’d fallen in war for the sake of the father-land.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Words failed them, and all they could do was shake with laughter.They were still laughing when the second daughter said to her eldest sister.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“So you’d like to marry Yasukuni Shrine?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, so would I. I’d love it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let’s both do just that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Come on.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All right then, if you won’t join me, I’ll take a rickshaw and go get married by myself ”“Babu go, too,” piped up the smallest of my master’s daughters.Indeed, such a triple marrying-off would suit him very well.At that moment there came the sound of a rickshaw stopping in front of the house, followed by the lively voice of a rickshawman announcing the arrival of my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would seem he has got back safely from the police station.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Leaving the rickshawman to hand over a large parcel to the maid, my master came into the living room with an air of perfect composure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Greeting his niece with a friendly, “Ah, so there you are,” he flung down beside the family’s famous oblong brazier some bottle shaped object he’d brought back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An object of that shape is not necessarily a bottle, and it certainly doesn’t look much like a vase.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being so odd a specimen of earthenware, for the time being I’ll content myself with calling it a bottle shaped object.“What a peculiar bottle!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Did you bring it back from the police station?” asks Yukie, as she stands it up on its base.Glancing at his niece, my master proudly comments, “Isn’t it a beautiful shape?”“A beautiful shape?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That thing?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I don’t think it beautiful at all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What ever made you bring home such an awful oil jar?”“How could this treasure possibly be an oil jar!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a vulgar comment!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’re hopeless.”“What is it then?”“A vase.”“For a vase, its mouth is too small and its body far too wide.”“That’s exactly why it’s so remarkable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You have absolutely no artistic taste.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Almost as bad as your aunt.” Holding the oil jar up toward the paper-window, he stands and gazes at it.“So, I have no artistic sense.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I see.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I certainly wouldn’t come home from a police station bearing an oil jar as a present.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Auntie, what do you think?”Her aunt is far too engrossed to be bothered.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She has opened the parcel and is now frantically checking the goods.“Gracious me!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Burglars seem to be making progress.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All these things have been washed and ironed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just look, dear,” she says.“Who said I was given an oil jar at the police station?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The fact is that I got so bored with waiting that I went out for a walk and, while I was walking, I saw this splendid vessel in a shop and picked it up for a song.You, of course, wouldn’t see it, but it’s a rare object.”“It’s too rare.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And tell me, where was it that you walked about?”“Where?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Around Nihon-zutsumi, of course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I also visited Yoshiwara.It’s quite a lively place, that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Have you ever seen the iron gate?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I bet you haven’t.”“Nothing would ever induce me to go and look at it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I have no cause to traipse around a brothel area like Yoshiwara.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How could you, a teacher, go to such a place?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am deeply shocked.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What d’you say, Auntie?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Auntie!”“Yes, dear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I rather think there’s something missing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is this the lot?”“The only item missing is the yams.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They instructed me to be there by nine o’clock and then they kept me waiting until eleven.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s outrageous.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The Japanese police are plainly no good at all.”“The Japanese police may be no good, but trotting about in Yoshiwara is very decidedly worse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you’re found out, you’ll get the sack.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Won’t he, Auntie?”“Yes, probably.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My dear,” she went on turning to her husband, “the lining of my obi is gone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I knew there was something missing.”“What’s so serious about an obi lining?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just forget it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Think about me.For three long hours they kept me waiting.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A whole half-day of my precious time completely wasted.” My master has now changed into Japanese clothes and, leaning against the brazier, sits and gawps entrancedly at his ghastly oil jar.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His wife, recovering rapidly from her loss, replaces the returned articles in a cupboard and comes back to her seat.“Auntie,” says the persistent Yukie, “he says this oil jar is a rare object.Don’t you think it dirty?”“You bought that thing in Yoshiwara?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Really!”“What do you mean by ‘Really!’?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As if you understand anything!”“But surely, a jar like that!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You could find one anywhere without cavorting off to Yoshiwara.”“That’s just where you’re wrong.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This isn’t an object you could find any where.”“Uncle does take after that stone Jizō, doesn’t he?”“None of your cheek, now.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The trouble with college girls today is their far too saucy tongues.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’d do better to spend time reading the Proper Conduct of a Woman.”“Uncle, it’s a fact, isn’t it, that you don’t like insurance policies?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But tell me, which do you dislike more, college girls or insurance policies?”“I do not dislike insurance policies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Insurance is a necessary thing.Anyone who gives even half a thought to the future is bound to take out a policy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But college girls are good-for-nothings.”“I don’t care if I am a good-for-nothing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But you can talk!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You aren’t even insured!”“As of next month, I shall be.”“Are you sure?”“Of course I’m sure.”“Oh, you shouldn’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s silly to get insured.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would be much better to spend the premium money on something else.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Don’t you agree, Auntie?”Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sneaze grins, but my master, looking serious, retorts, “You only say such irresponsible things because you imagine you’re going to go on living until you’re a hundred years old.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even two hundred.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when you’ve grown a little more mature, you’ll come to realize the necessity of insurance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From next month, I shall definitely insure myself.”“Oh, well.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can’t be helped then.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Actually, if you can afford to throw away cash on an umbrella as you did the other day, you might as well waste your wealth on insuring yourself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You bought it for me even though I kept saying I didn’t want it.”“You really didn’t want it?”“No.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I most certainly did not want any umbrella.”“Then you can give it back to me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tonko needs one badly, so I’ll give it to her.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Have you brought it with you today?”“But that’s really mean.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How could you!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s terrible to make me give it back after you’ve bought it for me.”“I asked you to return it only because you clearly stated that you didn’t want it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s nothing terrible about that.”“It’s true I don’t need it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But you’re still terrible.”“What nonsense you do talk.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You say you don’t want it, so I ask you to return it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Why should that be terrible?”“But.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“But what?”“But that’s terrible.”“You’re making no sense at all, just repeating the same irrational assertion.”“Uncle, you too are repeating the same thing.”“I can’t help that if you initiate the repetitions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You did definitely say you didn’t want it.”“Yes, I did say that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And it’s true that I don’t need it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I don’t like to return it.”“Well, I am surprised.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’re not only irrational and unreasonable but downright obstinate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A truly hopeless case.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Don’t they teach you logic at your school?”“Oh, I don’t care.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am uneducated anyway.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Say anything you like about me!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But to ask me to return my own thing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even a stranger wouldn’t make such a heartless request.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You could learn a thing or two from poor old Daft Bamboo.’“From whom?”“I mean you should be more honest and frank.”“You’re a very stupid girl and uncommonly obstinate.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That’s why you fail to pass your exams.”“Even if I do fail, I shan’t ask you to pay my school fees.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So there!” At this point Yukie appeared to be shaken by uncontrollable emotions.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tears gushed out of her eyes and, pouring down her cheeks, fell to stain her purple dress.My master sat there stupefied.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As though he believed it might help him understand what mental processes could produce such copious tears, he sat and blankly stared, sometimes at the top of her skirt, sometimes, at her down-turned face.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just then, O-san appeared at the door where, squatting with her hands spread out on the matting, she announced, “There is a visitor, Sir.”“Who is it?” asks my master.“A student from your school,” answers O-san, casting a sharp sidelong glance at Yukie’s tear-stained face.My master took himself off to the drawing room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In pursuit of further material for this book, in particular as it might bear upon my study of the human animal, I sneaked out after him by way of the veranda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one is to make a worthwhile study of mankind, it is vital to seize upon eventful moments.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At ordinary times, most human beings are wearisomely ordinary; depressingly banal in appearance and deadly boring in their conversation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, at certain moments, by some peculiar, almost supernatural, process their normal triviality can be transformed into something so weird and wonderful that no feline scholar of their species can afford to miss any occasion when that transformation seems likely to take place.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Yukie’s sudden deluge of tears was a very good example of this phenomenon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though Yukie possesses an incomprehensible and unfathomable mind, she gave no evidence of it in her chattering with Mrs. Sneaze.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, as soon as my master appeared and flung his filthy oil jar into the situation,Yukie was instantly transfigured.Like some sleeping dragon startled into its draconian reality by torrents of water pumped upon it by some idiotic fire engine, unbelievably Yukie suddenly revealed the depths of her wonderfully devious, wonderfully beautiful, wonderfully wondrous character in all its exquisite subtlety.Such wonderful characteristics are, in fact, common among women throughout the world, and it is regrettable that women so seldom make them manifest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On reflection, it would perhaps be more accurate to say that, while these characteristics do continuously manifest themselves, they rarely appear in such uninhibited form, so purely, openly and unconstrainedly, as they did in Yukie’s outburst.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No doubt I owe it to my master—that commendably crotchety crank who harbors no ill-heartedness when he strokes my fur in the wrong direction—that I have been privileged to witness such a revelation of the female soul.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I tag along through life behind him, wherever we go he provokes more drama than any of the protagonists ever realize.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am fortunate to be the cat of such a man, for, thanks to him, my short cat’s life is crammed with incident.Now, who, I wonder, is the visitor awaiting us?It proved to be a schoolboy of about the same age as Yukie, perhaps sixteen or seventeen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His hair is cropped so short that the skin of his skull, a truly massive skull, shines through it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With a dumpy nose in the middle of his face, he sits despondently waiting in a corner of the room.Apart from his enormous skull, there is nothing remarkable in his features.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, since that head looks huge in its virtually hairless state, it will certainly catch the eye when he lets his hair grow long as does my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is one of my master’s private theories that heads so vast are always addled.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He may, of course, be right, but heads of such Napoleonic grandeur remain indeed impressive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The lad’s kimono, like that of any houseboy, is made out of common, dark blue cotton with patterns splashed in white.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I cannot identify the style of the pattern, possibly Satsuma, possibly Kurume, even perhaps plain Iyo, but he is undoubtedly wearing a lined kimono of dark blue cotton patterned with splotches of white.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Its sleeves seem somewhat short, and he would appear to be wearing neither a shirt nor any underwear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I understand that it is currently considered very stylish, positively dandified, to go about in a lined kimono without underwear and even without socks, but this particular young man, far from seeming stylish, gives a strong impression of extreme shabbiness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In particular I notice that, barefooted like our recent burglar, he has marked the matting with three dirty footprints and now, doing his best to look respectful and certainly looking ill at ease, sits uncomfortably upon the fourth of them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is in no way extraordinary to see respectable persons behaving respectfully, but when some wild, young hooligan with his skinhead hairstyle and his too-small clothing seats himself in a reverent posture, the effect is distinctly incongruous.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Creatures who have the effrontery even to be proud of their insolent refusal to bow to their teachers when they meet them in the street must find it very painful to sit up properly like anyone else, even for so little as half an hour.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Moreover, since this particular yahoo is actually trying to behave as if he were a gentleman by birth, a man of natural modesty and of cultivated virtue, the comic incompetence of his performance must surely add to his sufferings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I marvel at the agonizing self-control by which a lout so boisterous both in the classroom and on the playground can bring himself to endure such a laughable charade.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is pitiful but, at the same time, funny.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In confrontations of this sort, however stupid my master may be, he still seems to carry rather more weight than any individual pupil.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, my master must be feeling pretty pleased with himself.The saying goes that even motes of dust, if enough of them pile up, will make a mountain.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One solitary schoolboy may well be insignificant, but schoolboys ganged together can be a formidable force, capable of agitating for the expulsion of a teacher, even of going on strike.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as cowards grow aggressive under the spur of grog, so may students emboldened by mere numbers into stirring up a riot be regarded as having lost their senses by becoming intoxicated with people.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How else can one explain how my master, who, however antiquated and decrepit he may be, is nevertheless a teacher, could in his own schoolroom have been reduced to an object of derision by this scruffy little runt now making himself small, dejected perhaps rather than truly humbled, in a corner of our room?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even so, l find it hard to credit that so miserable a snivelard could ever have dared to rag or mock my master.That noble figure, shoving a cushion toward the drooping crophead, bade him sit on it, but the latter, though he managed to mumble a nervous “thank you,” made no move at all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s quaint to see a living being, even this bighead, sitting blankly with a partly faded cushion rammed up against his knees.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The cushion, of course, says nothing, not even, “Sit on me.” But cushions are for sitting on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mrs. Sneaze didn’t go to a market stall and buy this particular cushion in order that it should be looked at.It follows that anyone who declines to sit on the cushion is, in effect, casting a slur on its cushionly good name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, when my master has specifically offered the cushion for sitting upon, a refusal to do so extends the insult to the cushion into a slight upon my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This crophead glaring at the cushion and thereby slighting my master does not, of course, have any personal dislike for the cushion itself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As a matter of fact, the only other occasion in his life when he sat in a civilized manner was during the memorial rites for his grandfather, so his present sally into decorum is bringing on pins and needles in his feet while his toes, excruciated by the pressures of propriety, have long been signaling blue murder.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, the clot won’t sit on the cushion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He will not do so, though the cushion, clearly embarrassed by the situation, yearns to be sat on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even though my master requests he use the cushion, still this oaf declines it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He is a very wearisome young man.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he can be so overweeningly modest on a visit, he ought to trot out a little more of his precious modesty when roistering around with his cronies in the schoolroom and at his lodgings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He positively reeks of decorous reserve when it’s totally uncalled for; yet, when just a touch of self-depreciation would hardly come amiss, he’s raucous, coarse, and cocky.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What an irksome, cross-grained, crophead this young rascal is.At that moment the sliding door behind him quietly slid open and Yukie came in formally to place a cup of tea before the silent youth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In normal circumstances, he would have greeted the appearance of such refreshment with jeering catcalls about poor, old Savage Tea, but today, already wilting under my master’s immediate presence, he suffers further agony as a prissily conducted young lady serves him tea with all that affected ceremoniality which has only recently been drilled into her at school.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As Yukie closed the sliding door she allowed herself, safe behind the young man’s back, to break into a broad grain.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which shows that a female is remarkably more self-possessed than a male of the same age.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed,Yukie very evidently has far more spirit to her than this cushion shunning twit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Her bare-faced grin is all the more remarkable when one remembers that, only a few minutes ago, tears of resentment were pouring down her cheeks.After Yukie had left, a long silence fell.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Eventually my master, feeling that the interview was in danger of becoming some kind of dour religious exercise, took the initiative and opened his mouth.“Your name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
what did you say it was?”“Yore.”“Yore?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Yore and what else?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What’s your first name?”“Lancelot.”“Lancelot Yore.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I see.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Quite a resounding name.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Certainly not modern, a somewhat old-fashioned name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You are in your fourth year, aren’t you?”“No.”“Your third year?”“No, my second year.”“And in Class A?”“In Class B.”“In B?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, you’re in my class.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I see.” My master appeared impressed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He had taken note of this particularly monstrous head since its bearer first joined the school, and had recognized it immediately.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, that head has so long and so deeply impressed my master that, every so often, he actually dreams about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, being of a totally impractical nature, he had never connected that extraordinary head with that odd old-fashioned name, and had somehow failed to connect either with his own second-year Class B. Consequently, when he realized that the impressive head that haunted his dreams actually belonged to one of his own pupils, he was genuinely startled.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All the more so since he cannot imagine why this big headed and oddly named member of his own class should now have come to see him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master is unpopular, and hardly a single schoolboy ever comes near him, even at the New Year.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As a matter of fact, this Lancelot Yore is the very first such visitor, and my master is understandably puzzled by his call.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is inconceivable that the visit could be purely social, for how could my master be of the faintest interest to any of his pupils?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It seems equally inconceivable that a boy of this kind could need advice about his personal affairs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, it is just conceivable that Lancelot Yore might come around to urge my master into resigning, but in such a case one would expect him to be, if not blatantly aggressive, at least defiant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, unable to make heads or tails of the situation, is at a complete loss and, to judge by his appearance, it would seem that Lancelot Yore is himself by no means certain why he has made his visit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the end my master was driven to asking point-blank questions.“Have you come here for a chat?”“No, not for that.”“Then you have something to tell me?”“Yes.”“About school?”“Yes, I wanted to tell you something about.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“What is it?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tell me.”“Right, then.”Lancelot lowers his eyes and says nothing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Normally, considered as a second-year student at middle school, Lancelot is talkative.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though his brain is undeveloped in comparison with his skull, he expresses himself rather more effectively than most of his fellow students in Class B.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, it was he who recently made my master look rather a fool by asking him how to translate “Columbus” into Japanese.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That such a tricky questioner should be as reluctant to start speaking as some stammering princess suggests that something very weird must be involved.Hesitation so prolonged and so entirely out of character cannot possibly be due to modesty.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even my simple master thought the matter really rather odd.“If you have something to say, go ahead and say it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Why do you hesitate?”“It’s a bit difficult to explain.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Difficult?” says my master peering across to study Lancelot’s face.But his visitor still sits with his eyes lowered, and my master finds it impossible to read anything from their expression.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Changing his tone of voice, he added, “Don’t worry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Tell me anything you like.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nobody else is listening, and I won’t pass on a single word to anyone.”“Could I really tell you?” Lancelot is still wavering.“Why not?” says my master, taking a sort of plunge.“All right, I’ll tell you.”Abruptly lifting up his close-cropped head the boy glanced diffidently at my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His eyes are triangular in shape.My master puffed out his cheeks with cigarette smoke and, slowly expelling it, looked at his visitor sideways.“Well, actually.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
things have become awkward.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“What things?”“Well, it’s all terribly awkward, and that’s why I’ve come.”“Yes, but what is it that you find so awkward?”“I really didn’t mean to do such a thing, but as Hamada urged and begged me to lend it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“When you say Hamada, do you mean Hamada Heisuke?”“Yes.”“Did you lend him money for board and lodging?”“Oh, no, I didn’t lend him that.”“Then, what did you lend him?”“I lent him my name.”“Whatever was he doing borrowing your name?”“He sent a love letter.”“He sent what?”“I explained I’d rather do the posting than the lending of my name.”“You’re not making much sense.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Who did what anyway?”“A love letter was sent.”“A love letter?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To whom?”“As I said, it’s so difficult to tell you.”“You mean you’ve sent a love letter to some woman?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is that it?”“No, it wasn’t me.”“Hamada sent it?”“It wasn’t Hamada either.”“Then who did send it?”“That’s not known.”“None of this makes sense.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Did no one send it?”“Only the name is mine.”“Only the name is yours?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I still don’t understand.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’ll have to explain what’s happened clearly and logically.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the first place, who actually received the love letter?”“A girl named Goldfield who lives just round the corner.”“Goldfield?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The businessman?”“Yes, his daughter.”“And what do you mean when you say you lent only your name?”“Because that girl is such a dolled-up and conceited pinhead, we decided to send her a love letter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Hamada said it had to be signed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when I told him to sign it himself, he argued that his name wasn’t sufficiently interesting, that Lancelot Yore would be very much more impressive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So I ended up by lending my name.”“And do you know the girl?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Are you friends?”“Friends?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Of course not.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve never set eyes on her.”“How very imprudent!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Fancy sending a love letter to someone you’ve never even seen!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What made you do such a thing?”“Well, everyone said she was stuck-up and pompous, so we thought we’d make a fool of her.”“That’s even more rash!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So you sent the letter clearly signed with your name?”“Yes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The letter itself was written by Hamada.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I lent my name, and Endo took it round to her house at night and stuck it in the letter box.”“Then all three of you are jointly responsible?”“Yes, but afterward, when I thought about being found out and possibly expelled from school, I got so worried that I haven’t been able to sleep for the last two or three nights.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s why I’m not my usual self.”“It’s a quite unbelievably stupid thing you’ve done.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tell me, when you signed that letter did you give the school’s address?”“No, of course I made no mention of the school.”“Well, that’s something.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you had and it ever came out, the good name of our school would be disgraced.”“Do you think I’ll be expelled?”“Well, I don’t know.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“My father is very strict and my mother is only a stepmother, so if anything happened such as being expelled, I’d really be in the soup.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Do you reckon I’ll get expelled?”“You must understand, you shouldn’t have done a thing like that.”“I didn’t mean to really, but somehow I just did.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Couldn’t you save me from being expelled?” With the tears running down his face, the pathetic Lancelot implores my master’s help.For quite some time behind the sliding door Mrs. Sneaze and her niece have been convulsed with silent giggles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, doggedly maintaining an air of importance, keeps on repeating his, “Well, I don’t know.” Altogether a facinating experience.It is possible that some of you human beings might, and very reasonably, ask me what I find so fascinating about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For every living being, man or animal, the most important thing in this world is to know one’s own self.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Other things being equal, a human being that truly knows himself is more to be respected than a similarly enlightened cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Should the humans of my acquaintance ever achieve such self-awareness, I would immediately abandon, as unjustifiedly heartless, this somewhat snide account of their species as I know them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, just as few human beings actually know the size of their own noses, even fewer know the nature of their own selves, for if they did, they would not need to pose such a question to a mere cat whom they normally regard, even disregard, with contempt.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thus, though human beings are always enormously pleased with themselves, they usually lack that self-perception which, and which alone, might justify their seeing themselves, and their boasting of it wherever they go, as the lords of all creation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To top things off, they display a brazenly calm conviction in their role which is positively laughable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For there they are, making a great nuisance of themselves with their fussing entreaties to be taught where to find their own fool noses, while at the same time strutting around with placards on their backs declaring their claim to be lords of creation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Would common logic or even common sense lead any such patently loony human being to resign his claim to universal lordship?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not on your life!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Every idiot specimen would sooner die than surrender his share in the fantasy of human importance.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Any creature that behaves with such blatant inconsistency and yet contrives never to recognize the least minim of self-contradiction in its behavior is, of course, funny.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But since the human animal is indeed funny, it follows that the creature is a fool.The foregoing events occurred precisely as I have recorded them and, as external realities, they left their quaint, little ripples on the stream of time.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But in this particular case it was not their manifested conduct which made my master,Yukie, and Yore strike me as amusing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What tickled me was the differing quality of reaction in their inmost hearts, which the same external events evoked in these several persons.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First of all, my master’s heart is rather cold, and so was his reaction to these happenings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However strictly Yore’s harsh father may treat the boy, however hurtfully his stepmother may pick on him, my master’s heart would not be moved.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How could it be?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Yore’s possible expulsion from school does not raise any of the issues that would be involved if my master were dismissed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, if all the pupils, nearly a thousand of them, were simultaneously expelled, then the teachers might find it hard to earn a living: but whatever fate befalls this wretched single pupil, the daily course of my master’s own life will be totally unaffected.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Obviously, where there is no self-interest there is not going to be much sympathy.It is just not natural to knit one’s brows, to blow one’s nose, or to draw great sighs over the misfortunes of complete strangers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I simply do not believe the human animal is capable of showing such understanding and compassion.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"People sometimes squeeze out a few tears or try looking sorry as a kind of social obligation, a sort of tax-payment due in acknowledgement of having been born into a community.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But such gestures are never heart felt, and their effective performance, like any other act of chicanery, does in fact demand a high degree of skill.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Persons who perform these trickeries most artfully are regarded as men of strong artistic feelings and earn the deepest respect of their less-gifted fellows.It follows, of course, that those who are most highly esteemed are those most morally dubious, an axiom which can easily be proved by putting it to the test.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master, being extremely ham-handed in matters of this kind, commands not the least respect and, having no hope of winning respect by crafty misrepresentation of his true feelings, is quite open in expressing his inner cold-heartedness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The sincerity of his indifference emerges very clearly from the way in which he fobs off poor young Yore’s repeated pleas for help with repetitions of the same old formulae: “Well, I don’t know” and “Hmm, I wonder.” I hasten to comment that I trust my readers will not begin to dislike so good a man as my master just because he happens to be cold-hearted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldness is the inborn natural condition of the human heart, and the man who does not hide that fact is honest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If in circumstances such as I’ve described, you really are expecting something more than cold-heartedness, then I can only say that you have sadly overestimated the worth of humankind.When even mere honesty is in notably short supply, it would be absolutely ridiculous to expect displays of magnanimity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Or do you seriously believe that the Eight Good Men have stepped out of the pages of Bakin’s silly novel in order to take up residence in our neighborhood?So much for my master.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let us now consider his womenfolk tittering away together in the living room.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They, in fact, have gone a stage beyond the pure indifference of my master and, naturally adapted as they are to the comic and the grotesque, are thoroughly enjoying themselves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"These females regard the matter of the love letter, a matter of excruciating concern to that miserable crophead, as a gift from a kindly heaven.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There is no particular reason why they regard it as a blessing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It just seems like one to them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, if one analyzes their mirth, the simple fact is that they are glad that Yore’s in trouble.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ask any female whether she finds it amusing, even a cause for outright laughter, when other people are in trouble, and she will either call you mad or affect to have been deliberately insulted by a question so demeaning to the dignity of her sex.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It may well be true that she feels she’s been insulted, but it is also true that she laughs at people in trouble.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The reality of this ladylike position is that, inasmuch as the lady intends to do something that would impugn her character, no decent person should draw attention to the fact.Correspondingly, the gentleman’s position is to acknowledge that he steals but to insist that nobody should call him immoral because an accusation of immorality would involve a stain on his character, an insult to his good name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Women are quite clever: they think logically.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one has the ill luck to be born a human being, one must prepare oneself not to be distressed that other people will not so much as turn to look when you are being kicked and beaten up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And not just that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One must learn to think it a pleasure to be spat upon, shat upon, and then held up to be laughed at.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one cannot learn these simple lessons, there is no chance of becoming a friend of such clever creatures as women.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
By an understandable error of judgement the luckless Lancelot Yore has made a sad mistake and is now greatly humiliated.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He might possibly feel that it is uncivilized to snigger at him behind his back when he is thus humiliated, but any such feeling on his part would simply be a demonstration of pure childishness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I understand that women call it narrow-mindedness if one gets angry with persons who commit a breach of etiquette.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, unless young Yore is prepared to acquire that further humiliation, he’d best belt up.Finally, I will offer a brief analysis of Yore’s own inward feelings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That infantile suppliant is a living lump of quivering anxiety.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as Napoleon’s massive head was bulgy with ambitions, so Yore’s gurt skull is bursting with anxiety.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The occasional puppylike quivering of his pudgy nose betrays that this inner distress has forced a connection with his nasal nerves so that, by the nastiest of reflex actions, he twitches without knowing it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now for several days he has been at the end of his tether, going around with a lump in his stomach as though he’d swallowed a cannon ball.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Finally, at his wits’ end and in the extremity of his desperation, he has come to humble his head before a teacher he most cordially dislikes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I imagine the addled thinking behind this desperate act was that, since teachers are supposed to look after their pupils, perhaps even the loathed Sneaze might somehow help him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Lost in the miasma of his inner agony is any recollection of his habitual ragging of my master; forgotten, too, is the fact that he spent his witless days in egging on his fellow hooligans to hoot and mock old Savage Tea.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He seems to believe that, however much he’s made a nuisance of himself he’s actually entitled to his teacher’s help for the single reason that he happens to be a member of that teacher’s class.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He is indeed a very simple soul.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My master did not choose the class he teaches: he was directed to that work by order of the headmaster.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am reminded of that bowler hat of Waverhouse’s uncle.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It was no more than a bowler hat in name.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The idea of my master as a teacher who is also the mentor of his pupils is equally unreal.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Teacher, sneacher.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A name means nothing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If it did, any marriage broker would by now have been able to interest some aspiring bachelor in a girl with a name as beautiful as that snow river name of Yukie’s.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The dismal Yore is not only daftly egocentric but, daftly overestimating human kindliness, assumes that his fellow creatures are under some form of obligation to be nice to him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m sure he has never dreamt that he might be laughed at, so at least he’s learning some useful home truths about his species from his visit to the home of the “person in charge.” As a result, he will himself become more truly human.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His heart, benignly chilled, will grow indifferent to other people’s troubles and, in time, he’ll even learn to jeer at the distressed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The world will come to swarm with little Yores, all doing their best to stretch themselves into full-blown Goldfields.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For the lad’s sake, I do hope he learns his lesson quickly and grows up soon into his full humanity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Otherwise, no matter how hard he worries, no matter how bitterly he repents, no matter how fervently his heart may yearn to be reformed, he can never so much as hope to be able to achieve the spectacular success of that model of humanity, the highly respected Goldfield.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the contrary, he will be banished from human society.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Compared with that, expulsion from some piddling middle school would be as nothing.I was idly amusing myself with these reflections when the sliding door from the hall was roughly jerked aside and half a face suddenly appeared at the opening.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My master was mumbling, “Well, I really don’t know,” when this half-face called his name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He wrenched his head around to find a shining segment of Avalon Coldmoon beaming down upon him.“Why, hello,” says my master making no move to get up,“come along in.”“Aren’t you busy with a visitor?” the visible half of Coldmoon asks politely.“Never mind about that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Come on in.”“Actually, I’ve called to ask you to come out with me.”“Where to?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Akasaka once again?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve had enough of that district.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You made me walk so much the other day that my legs are still quite stiff.”“It will be all right today.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Come on out and give those legs a stretch.”“Where would we go?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Look, don’t just stand there.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Come along in.”“My idea is that we should go to the zoo and hear their tiger roar.”“How dreary.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I say, old man, do come in if only for a few minutes.”Coldmoon evidently came to the conclusion that he would not succeed by negotiating from a distance so, reluctantly removing his shoes, he slouched into the room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As usual, he is wearing gray trousers with patches on the seat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"These patches, he is always telling us, are not there either because the trousers are old or because his bottom is too heavy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The reason is that he has just started to learn how to ride a bicycle, and the patches are needed to resist the extra friction involved.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Greeting Yore with a nod and a brief hello, he sits down on the veranda side of the room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He has, of course, no idea that he is now sitting down with a direct rival in the lists of love, with the very person who has sent a love letter to that damsel now regarded by all and sundry as the future Mrs. Coldmoon.“There’s nothing particularly interesting about a tiger’s roar,” observed my master.“Well, not just at this exact moment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But my idea is that we should walk about for a bit and then go on to the zoo around eleven.”“So?”“By then, the old trees in the park will be darkly frightening like a silent forest.”“Well, possibly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Certainly, it will be a little more deserted than by daytime.”“We’ll follow a path as thickly wooded as possible, one where even in daytime few people pass.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, before you know it, we’ll find ourselves thinking we’re far away from the dusty city and a feeling, I’m sure, will grow within us that we’ve somehow wandered away into far-off mountains.”“What does one do with a feeling like that?”“Feeling like that, we’ll just stand there, silent and motionless for a little while.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, suddenly, the roar of a tiger will burst upon us.”“Is the tiger trained to roar precisely at that moment?”“I guarantee he’ll roar.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even in broad day that fearsome sound can be heard all the way over at the Science University.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, after dark, in the very dead of night, when not a soul’s about in the deep-hushed loneliness, when death can be felt in the air and one breathes the reek of evil mountain spirits.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Breathing the reek of evil mountain spirits?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Whatever does that mean?”“I understand it’s an expression used to signify a condition of extreme terror.”“Is it indeed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not an expression in common use.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I don’t believe I’ve ever heard it before.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, what then?”“Then the tiger roars.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A savage shattering roar that seems to strip each shaking leaf from the ancient cedar trees.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, it’s terrifying.”“I can well believe it is.”“Well then, how about joining me for such an adventure?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m sure we’ll enjoy it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
An experience to be treasured.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Everyone, sometime, that’s how I see it, really ought to hear a tiger roar from the depths of night.”“Well,” says my master, “I don’t know.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"” He drops on Coldmoon’s enthusiastic proposal for an expedition the same wet blanket of indifference with which he has muzzled Yore’s agonized entreaties.Up until this moment that dim nincompoop has been listening, enviously and in silence, to the talk about the tiger, but as a hypnotist’s key phrase will bring his subject to his senses, my master’s repetition of his indifference snapped Yore smartly back into remembrance of his own dilemma.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Revered teacher,” he muttered from his broken trance, “I’m worried sick.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What, what, shall I do?”Coldmoon, puzzled, stares at that enormous head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As for me, I feel suddenly moved, for no particular reason but the feeling, to leave this trio to themselves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, I excuse myself from their company and sidle around to the living room.There I find Mrs. Sneaze with the giggles.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She has poured tea into a cheap china cup and, placing that cup on a nasty antimony saucer, says to her niece, “Would you please take this to our guest?”“I’d rather not.”“Why not?” The mistress sounds surprised and her giggling stops abruptly.“I’d just rather not,” says Yukie.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"She suddenly adopts a peculiarly supercilious expression and, firmly seating herself on the matting, bends forward and low to study some rag of a daily newspaper.Mrs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sneaze immediately resumes negotiations.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“What a funny person you are.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s only Mr. Coldmoon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s no reason to act up.”“It’s simply that I really would prefer not to.” The girl’s eyes remain fixed on the newspaper, but it’s obvious that she’s too het up to be able to read a word of it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s more, if anyone points out that she isn’t reading, there’ll be another flood of maidenly tears.“Why are you being so shy?” This time, laughing, Mrs. Sneaze deliberately pushes the cup and saucer right onto the newspaper as it lies there flat on the floor.“What a nasty thing to do!” Yukie tries to yank the paper out from under the tea things, knocks them flying and the spilled tea shoots all over the paper and the living room matting.“There, now!” says the mistress.With a cry expressing a curious mixture of anger, shock, and embarrassment, Yukie scrambles to her feet and runs out into the kitchen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I imagine she’s gone to fetch a mop.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I find this little drama rather amusing.Mr.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldmoon, totally unaware of the female flurry which his visit appears to have stirred up in the living room, continues, somewhat oddly, his conversation with my master.“I notice,” he says, “that you’ve had new paper fixed on that sliding door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Who did it, if I may ask?”“The women.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Quite a good job they made of it, don’t you think?”“Yes, very professional.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You say ‘the women.’ Does that include that college girl who sometimes comes here visiting?”“Yes, she lent a hand.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact she was boasting that, since she can make such an obviously splendid job of papering a sliding door, she is also obviously well qualified to get married.”“I see,” says Coldmoon still studying the door.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Down the left side, there,” he eventually continued, “the paper has been fixed on taut and smooth, but along the right-hand edge it seems to have been inadequately stretched.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hence those wrinkles.”“That was where they started the job, before they’d really got the hang of it.”“I see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
lt’s certainly less well done.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The surface forms an exponential curve irrelatable to any ordinary function.” From the abyss of his scientific training Coldmoon dredges up monstrosities.“I dare say,” says my master, indifferent as ever.That dispassionate comment, it would seem, at last brings home to our hooligan scribe the complete hopelessness of hoping that even the most searing of his supplications could ever melt my master’s chilly disconcern.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Suddenly lowering his huge skull to the matting,Yore in total silence made his farewell salutation.“Ah,” said my master, “you’re leaving?”Yore’s crestfallen appearance provided his only answer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
We heard him dragging his heavy cedar clogs even after he’d gone out through the gate.A pitiable case.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If someone doesn’t come to his rescue, he could well compose one of those rock-top suicide poems and then fling his stupid body over the lip of Kegon Falls.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Come what may, the root-cause of all this trouble is the flibbertigibbet self-conceit of that insufferable Miss Goldfield.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If Yore does do himself in, it is to be hoped that his ghost will find the time to scare that girl to death.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No man need regret it if a girl like that, even a brace or more of them, were removed from this already sufficiently troubled world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It seems to me that Coldmoon would be well advised to marry some more ladylike young person.“Was that, then, one of your pupils?”“Yes.”“What an enormous head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is he good at his work?”“Rather poor for that size of head.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But every now and again he asks original questions.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The other day he caught me off balance by asking for a translation of the meaning of Columbus.”“Maybe the improbable size of his braincase leads him to pose such an improbable question.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whatever did you answer?”“Oh, something or other off the cuff.”“So you actually did translate it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That’s remarkable.”“Children lose faith in a language teacher who fails to provide them, on demand, with a translation of anything they may ask.”“You’ve become quite a politician.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But to judge by that lad’s look, he must be terribly run down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

Silly young ass!”“What’s it all about?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The mere sight of him moves one’s sympathy.What’s he done?”“Rather a stupid thing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s sent a love letter to Goldfield’s daughter.”“What?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That great numbskull?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Students nowadays seem to stop at nothing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Quite astonishing!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"On the contrary, I find it most diverting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

.”“You mean that three boys sent one love letter to Miss Goldfield?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

Such a joint letter sounds rather like three people settling down to share one portion of a Western-style dinner.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Don’t you agree?”“Well, they did divide the functions up between them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One wrote the letter, another posted it, and the third loaned his name for its signature.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That young blockhead whom you saw just now, quite the silliest of them all, he’s the one who lent his name.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Yet he actually told me that he’s never even set eyes on the girl.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I simply can’t imagine how anyone could do such a ludicrous thing.”“Well, I think it’s spectacular, a wonder of our times, a real masterpiece of the modern spirit!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

Was that why he looked so very down in the mouth?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He must, at heart, be a very timid boy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You gave him some advice, I suppose?”“He’s scared silly of being expelled from school.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

It’s just not that important.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, I’d expect the Goldfields to take it as an honor and to go around boasting about it.”“Oh, surely not!”“Anyway, even if it was wrong to do such a thing, it’s hardly fair to let that poor boy worry himself sick about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"And all this over a bare square foot of board where the mildest tap with my right, front paw would wreak irreparable havoc.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As Singleman might quote from his compendium of Zen sermons, one gathers grasses and with their thatch creates a hermitage only to find the same old field when the thatch is blown away.You set the pieces out and then you take them off.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A silly occupation.Why don’t the players keep their hands in the folds of their kimonos and simply stare at an empty board?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the earlier stages of the game, with only thirty or forty pieces in place, one could not honestly describe the effect as an eyesore, but as things move to a climax, the scrimmage of black and white becomes an offense to the civilized mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The black and white pieces are so crammed together that they squeak and grate in a jostle of stones.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The ones at the edges seem bound to be pushed clean off the board.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No piece can get its neighbors to make room.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"None has the right to order those in front to offer gangway to the crush behind.All they can do is to crouch down where they are and, without stirring, resign themselves to their fate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Go is a product of the mind of man and, just as human taste is accurately mirrored in this ever-more-restrictive game, so one may see in the cramping of the pieces an image of the human urge to be jammed up tight together.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In that ugly crowding one may fairly read man’s mean antipathy to openness, his deliberate squeezing and diminishment of the very universe, his passion for territorial limitation within such dwarfish boundaries that he rarely steps beyond his own immediate shadow.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He wallows in the rigors of constriction, in the painful inhibitions of his choice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is, in short, a masochist.Heaven knows why the flippant minded Waverhouse and his Zen besotted friend have chosen today for their game, but chosen it they have.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They dug the board out from some dusty cupboard, found the necessary playing stones and eventually settled down to the crass fatuity of go.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As might be expected of them, they began by playing almost skittishly, plonking down their blacks and whites in a random scatter across the board.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the board has only just so many squares and it wasn’t long before flippancy and otherworldliness found themselves in conflict.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As the pressure increased, so did the verbal exchanges, spiced, as is their wont, with scarcely relevant quotations from the minor Chinese classics.“Waverhouse, your play is simply awful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can’t you see it’s crazy to place your piece there?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Take it away and try it somewhere else.”“A mere Zen zealot may choose to think it crazy, but I learned that ploy from studying the practice of the great go master Hon’imbō.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You must learn to live with greatness.”“But the piece will be slaughtered.”“Did not the noble Hankai accept not only death for the sake of his lord but even pork on a poignard?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Consider me no less sporting.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Fair enough?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Right then, that’s my move.”“So that’s your decision.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It soothes my troubled brow.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As the poet said, ‘A balmy breeze has blown in from the south and the palace grows a shade more cool.’ Now,” says Singleman, “if I link my chain of pieces with another piece, just here, lo and behold, I’m safe.”“Aha, so you’ve linked them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My, what a clever old thing you are.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I never thought you’d see that one.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But there you go, quick as a flash, bang, bang, and you think I’m dead.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’d hoped you’d be guided by the good old folk song ‘Don’t Bang Bells at the Hachiman Shrine.’ So what do I do now?” Waverhouse sought to look crafty.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I’ll tell you what I’ll do.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ll put one here.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And what will poor pussy do next?”“Poor pussy will next do something both simple and daring, like this.Which blocks your line like ‘a sword that points up sharply at the sky.’”“Steady on, old man.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you do that, I’ve had it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hang on a moment, now.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Really, that’s not funny.”“I warned yon not to make that move.”“I offer my abject apologies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You were quite right, and I’ll take that move back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, while I ponder, take your white off, will you?”“What!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is this another of your sorry-I-wasn’t-really-ready gambits?”“And while you’re at it, you might remove the piece right next to it, too.”“You’ve got a damn nerve.”“You couldn’t be suggesting that I’m cheating, eh?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Oh, come on, Singleman, what’s a stone or two between friends?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t act so stuffy.Just be a good chap and take the damn things off.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It could hardly matter to a lofty soul like you, but to me it’s a matter of life and death.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Like that moment of supreme crisis in Kabuki plays when some character comes bounding on stage with shouts of ‘Hang on, hold it.’”“I fail to see the similarity.”“Never mind what you see or don’t see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just be a decent fellow and take those pieces off the board.”“This is the sixth time you’ve asked to have your move back.”“What a remarkable memory you have.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When we play next, I’ll double it up to a good, round dozen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, all I’m asking now is that yon should remove a couple of miserable stones, and I must say you’re being pretty stubborn about it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I would have thought that, with all your years of contemplating your navel, you’d have learnt by now to show a bit more give.”“But if I let you off, that daring risk I took just now will stack the odds against me.”“I thought I heard you prating that you pay no heed to such mundane considerations as winning or losing.”“I certainly don’t mind losing, but I don’t want you to win.”“Singleman, you dazzle me with the sophistication of your spiritual enlightenment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I positively gawp at this further manifestation of your gift for cutting through lightning by ‘dashing your sword at the winds of spring.’”“You’ve got that wrong.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It should be the other way around —cutting through the spring winds with a sword flash sharp as lightning.”“Indeed, indeed, a laughable mistake.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only I somehow feel my version sounds the better of the two.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I see myself as the last of the great diaskenasts.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But let that pass.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"‘That passed,’ the poet said, ‘so may this too.’ Since I see you’ve still got all your wits about you, it looks as though I’m done for on this part of the board, so I’d best give up the ghost.”“We have it from the patriarchs that, sharply different as they are, in ultimate reality there’s little to differentiate the quick from the dead.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I think you’re dead, and you’d be wise to be quick to accept it.”“Amen,” says Waverhouse, slapping down with a savage clack the piece in his hand on a different part of the board.While Waverhouse and Singleman are thus slugging it out in front of the alcove, Coldmoon and Beauchamp are sitting side-by-side near the entrance to the room.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My wretched master with his yellow face sits with them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Neatly lined up on the matting of the floor, just in front of Coldmoon and eyeing him fishily, three dried bonitos present an extraordinary spectacle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’d brought them around in the breast of his kimono and, though now exposed in all their nakedness, they still look warm from their walk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Beauchamp and my master were sitting staring at them with a finely balanced mixture of repulsion and curiosity when Coldmoon finally opened his mouth.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“As a matter of fact, I got back to Tokyo from my visit home about four days ago, but I’ve been so rushed off my feet with this and that that I couldn’t call around sooner.”“There was no need to hurry here,” observes my master with his usual lack of any social grace.“I wouldn’t have hurried, but for my anxiety to give you these fish as quickly as possible.”“But, they’re properly dried, aren’t they?”“Oh, yes indeed!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Dried bonitos are the speciality of my hometown.”“A speciality?” says my master.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“But I fancy one may find excellent dried bonito right here in Tokyo.” He lifts the largest fish and, bending slightly, sniffs it.“One cannot judge the quality of a dried bonito by smelling it.”“Are they special because they’re that much bigger?”“Eat one and see.”“Certainly I shall eat one.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But this one here seems to have an edge chipped off.”“That’s precisely why I was in a hurry to get them to you.”“I don’t understand.”“Well, actually it was slightly gnawed by rats.”“But that’s dangerous!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyone eating that could blacken with the plague.”“Not at all, it’s perfectly safe.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such modest gnawings, mere nips and nibbles, never hurt anyone.”“How on earth did the rats get at it?”“On board ship.”“Ship?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What ship?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How?”“I took passage here from home and, having nothing in which to carry your dried bonitos, I popped them into my violin’s cloth carrier-bag.And it was there, that night, that the damage was done.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Frankly, I’d not have cared if the rats had kept to the fish but unfortunately, perhaps mistaking it for another dried bonito, they also gnawed away at the frame of my precious instrument.”“What idiotic creatures!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps the life at sea blunts their sense of taste.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All that salt, you know: the coarseness of the sea-gone soul.”Having delivered himself of these odd remarks, my master sat and stared, fish-eyed and ictrine, at Coldmoon’s wrinkled gift.“It’s in the nature of rats, wherever they may happen to be living, not to discriminate in their rapacity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hence, even when I’d gotten the dried fish to my Tokyo lodgings, I worried for their safety.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It kept me awake at night.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So in the end I took them into my bed and slept with them.”“How revolting.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Surely a danger to health?”“Yes, I agree.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You’d better wash them thoroughly before you eat them.”“I doubt if just washing will do.”“Perhaps you should soak them in lye and then, for good measure and to restore the color, polish them up a bit.”“Aside from sleeping with ratty fish, did you also take your violin to bed?”“The violin’s too bulky to sleep with in one’s arms and.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”At this point the conversation was interrupted from the other side of the room by delighted shouts from Waverhouse.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Do you mean you’ve been to bed with a violin?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How truly romantic!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I recall a little poem from the past:The spring is passing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Arms can feelThe weight of the luteBecoming real.“That, of course, is just an old-fashioned haiku.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he wants to outdo the ancients, the bright young man of today has no choice but to sleep with a violin in his arms.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Beauchamp, lend me your ears.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How about this for a modern variation on the theme?Beneath this quilted coverlet,Warm to one’s skin,Night-long held safe, frets free from fret:My treasured violin.Of course violins don’t have frets, but what of that?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One can’t expect a nitpicking accuracy of detail in such a splendid example of new-style poetry.”Beauchamp, poor fellow, is a literal-minded youth and his serious mold of character cannot accommodate itself to the verve and shimmers of frivolity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I’m afraid,” he says, “that, unlike haiku, new-style poems cannot be constructed off the cuff.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They need deep thought, deep feeling, arduous fabrication.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But once they’re properly composed, their exquisite tonation, working on the inmost soul, can call up spirits from the vasty deep.”“Can they really?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, I never,” says Waverhouse at his falsely ingenuous best.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I’d always thought that only the smoke of hemp stalks, correctly burnt at the Feast of the Hungry Dead, could lure souls back to earth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Do you mean to say that new-style poetry is equally efficacious?”Letting his game go hang, he concentrates on teasing Beauchamp.“You’ll get trounced again if you keep on babbling rubbish,” my master warns him.But Waverhouse takes no notice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I myself am quite indifferent to winning or losing, but it just so happens that my opponent is now immobilized, squashed up tight like an octopus in a saucepan.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And it’s only to while away the tedium of waiting for him to decide upon his next wee wriggle of a move that I am forced to join you in your concourse of violins.”Singleman snorts in his exasperation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“For goodness sake,Waverhouse, it’s your move now.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m the one who’s being kept waiting.”“Ah?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So you’ve made a move?”“Of course I have—ages ago.”“Where?”“I’ve extended this diagonal of whites.”“So you have.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

Out of the extreme kindness of my heart I shall grant you an extra move.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Place a stone anywhere you like.”“You can’t play go like that.”“You refuse my generosity?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then you leave me no choice but to.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

what?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Incidentally, Coldmoon, your fiddle can’t be up to much if even the rats don’t like it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Why don’t you splash out on a better one?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Shall I get one of those antique models, at least three hundred years old, from Italy?”“I could never thank you enough—especially if you were also so kind as to foot the bill.”“How could anything as old as that be any use whatever?” His ignorance does not stop my master from speaking his mind.“I think, Sneaze, you’re comparing antique fiddles with antiquated men.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They’re not the same, you know.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet even among men, some of the older models—Goldfield for example—become more valuable with age.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And when it comes to violins it’s invariably a case of the older the better.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, Singleman, will you please get a move on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being myself no windbag, indeed a man succinct if not actually terse in speech, I will not waste time on a full quotation from the relevant Kabuki play, but have we not been warned by Keimasa that autumn days draw swiftly to their close?”“It’s pure agony playing go with a feckless galloper like you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s never time to think.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, if you insist on headlong play, that’s the way of it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I shall place one here.”“What a pity!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You’ve escaped my clutches after all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I had so hoped you wouldn’t make that move, and I’ve been racking my brains to think up enough rubbish to distract you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All, I fear, in vain.”“Naturally.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Some of us concentrate on the game, not on trying to cheat.”“Sir, I never cheat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I may pay less regard to the game than to games-manship, but that is precisely the teaching of the school of Hon’imbō, of the Goldfield School, and of the School of Modern Gentlemen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I say, Sneaze, you remember those sharpish pickles that Singleman gobbled down at Kamakura?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They seem, after all, to have done him good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s not much use at go, but nothing now seems able to perturb him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I take my hat off to his pickled nerves.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They’re steady as steel.”“Then why,” says my master with his back still turned toward Waverhouse, “doesn’t an inconsequential fidget like yourself make the effort to imitate his steadiness and sense?”Waverhouse, unusually, said nothing but just stuck out a large, red tongue.Singleman, seemingly unconcerned by these exchanges, tries once again to interest Waverhouse in their game.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“It’s you to go,” he says.As Waverhouse takes back his tongue and looks down at the board, Beauchamp turns to Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Tell me, when did you start playing the violin?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d very much like to learn, but they say it’s terribly difficult.”“Anyone can learn to play a little.”“It’s always been my sneaking hope that, given the similar nature of all arts, persons with an aptitude for poetry ought to be quick at mastering music.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Do you think there’s anything in it?”“Perhaps.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m sure you’d do all right: indeed, very well.”“When did you start your own study of the art?”“In high school.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Have I ever told you,” said Coldmoon turning to my master, “how I first came to learn the violin?”“No, not yet.”“Was it perhaps,” asks Beauchamp, “that you had some high school music teacher who encouraged you to learn?”“No, no teacher; in fact no human encouragement at all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I simply taught myself.”“Quite a genius.”“Being self-taught doesn’t necessarily mean that one’s a genius,” says Coldmoon looking sour.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He is, I think, the only being who’d resent being called a genius.“The point’s irrelevant.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just tell us how you taught yourself.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would he useful to know.”“And I’d be happy to tell you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sir,” he addresses my master, “have I your permission to do so?”“Of course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Please carry on.”“The streets these days are chock-a-block with bright, young men walking along with violin cases in their hands.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when I was a high school lad, very few of us could play any Western instrument whatsoever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My own particular school was way out in the sticks where, since life was lived in accordance with a strong tradition of extreme simplicity, nary a student played the violin.”“An interesting story seems to have started over there, Singleman, so let’s pack up this game right now.”“There are still a few points left undecided.”“Forget them all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m only too happy to make you a present of the lot.”“But I can’t accept that.”“What a meticulous man you are, totally insensitive to that broad approach one expects from a scholar of Zen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All right then, we’ll finish it off in double quick time.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldmoon, my dear fellow, I’m fascinated by your account of that high school.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Am I right in thinking yours must be that one where all the students went barefoot?”“It’s true, I attended the school about which so many such lying yarns have been told.”“But I’ve heard you drilled without shoes and that, from a thousand about-turns, the soles of your feet grew inches thick.”“Absolute nonsense!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Whoever stuffed you up with such a ludicrous canard?”“Never mind who.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But they also said that every student brings in for his lunch an enormous rice-ball, as big as a summer orange, hanging from his hip on a string.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is that a canard too?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s further said that the students gobble the rice like mad, unsalted though it is, in order to get at the pickled plum allegedly buried inside.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They certainly sound an extremely vigorous and hardy group of youngsters.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Are you listening, Singleman?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This is exactly the sort of story that appeals to you.”“I’m not at all sure that I get the story’s point, but I do indeed approve of simplicity and sturdiness.”“As to simplicity, there’s yet another characteristic of that area which should earn your praise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is, in fact, so simple that they’ve not yet heard of making ashtrays by sectioning bamboo.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A friend of mine who was once on the staff of Coldmoon’s school tried to buy such an ashtray, even one of the roughest hew, and the shopkeeper simply told him that, since anyone could go and cut himself an ashtray in the forest, there was no point in trying to make them as objects for sale.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now that’s what I call true simplicity.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
True sturdiness as well.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Singleman, you agree?”“Yes, yes, of course I do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if you’re going to secure your position, Waverhouse, you must immediately put down a reinforcing piece.”“Right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ll make assurance doubly, doubly sure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A stone placed there should finish the game.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You know, Coldmoon, when I heard your account of your early struggles I was frankly amazed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s quite astonishing that in such a backward place you should, unaided, have taught yourself to play the violin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"More than two thousand years ago, in the high days of the Han, that marvelous man Ch’ü Yüan was writing poems, still unmatched, about the wonders of a life withdrawn from the madding crowd.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It could be, Coldmoon, you were born to be our new Ch’ü Yüan.”“That I should very much dislike.”“Well than, how about being the Werther of our times?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s that, Singleman?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You want me to pick up my stones and count them?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What a pernickety bore you are!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There’s no need for counting.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s perfectly obvious that I’ve lost.”“But one cannot leave things hanging in the air.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One wants to know the score.”“All right, then.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Be so good as to do my counting for me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I really can’t be bothered with such a dull accountant’s chore when it is my solemn aesthetic duty to learn how the most gifted Werther of our day started learning to play the violin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Would you have me shunned by my ancestors?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Therefore,” says Waverhouse, “you must excuse me.” Sliding his cushion away from the gameboard, Waverhouse moved to sit near Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Singleman stayed where he was, methodically gathering stones and marshaling them in little armies to be counted.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldmoon resumes the telling of his story.“It was not only that the land was rugged, its inhabitants were philistine and coarse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They considered that any student with even the mildest interest in the arts would get them all laughed at for effeminacy by the students of other prefectures, so their persecution of anyone guilty of refinement was unremittingly merciless.”“It’s a sad fact,” says Waverhouse, “but the students in Coldmoon’s part of the country really are uncouth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why, for instance, are they always dressed in those dark blue, skirted trousers?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The color itself is odd enough, but it looks unpleasantly worse against their near-black skin which is, presumably, occasioned by the high degree of sea salt in the local air.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, it doesn’t greatly matter how dark the men become, but, if their women-folk are similarly blighted, it must affect their marriage prospects.” As usual, when Waverhouse joins in a conversation, its original drift is soon diverted into new and unlikely channels.“The women there are no less black than the men.”“Do the men show any wish to marry them?”“Since they’re all as black as each other, no one seems to notice.”“What a ghastly state of affairs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One’s heart bleeds, doesn’t it, Sneaze, for all those muddy women.”“Well, if you’re asking me, my opinion of women is that the blacker they are the better.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A light skinned female tends to grow more and more conceited every time she sees herself in a mirror.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And all women, all the time, are incorrigible, so anything,” says my master with a heavy sigh,“that makes them less delighted with themselves is very much to be wished for.”“But if the entire population is dark skinned, won’t black become beautiful and the blackest most fair?” Beauchamp puts his Finger on a tricky point.“The world would be a better place if we were only rid of them all.”My master puts his view in a nutshell.“If you go around saying things like that,” laughs Waverhouse, “your wife will give you what-for later on.”“No danger of that.”“She’s out?”“Yes, she went out quite some while ago with the children.”“No wonder it’s been quiet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Where’s she gone?”“I haven’t the faintest idea.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She goes out where and when she likes.”“And she comes home as she likes?”“More or less.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You two don’t know how lucky you are to be single.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I envy you both from the bottom of my heart.”Beauchamp looks slightly uncomfortable, but Coldmoon keeps on grinning.“All married men grow to feel like that,” says Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“What about you, Singleman?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Does your wife drive you crazy?”“Eh?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

The margin in my favor is no more than a measly eighteen stones.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now then, what was that you asked?”“I asked if you, too, were driven crazy by a troublesome wife.”“You must be joking again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, to answer your question, I’m not particularly troubled by my wife, perhaps because she loves me.”“Oh, I do beg your pardon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How typical of Singleman to have a loving wife.”“Singleman’s no singleton.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The world is full of loving wives.”Coldmoon, a somewhat unlikely champion of the ladies, pipes up sturdily in their defense.“Coldmoon’s right,” says Beauchamp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“As I see it, there are only two roads by which a man may come to perfect bliss: by the road of love, and by the road of art.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of all the forms of love, married love is perhaps the noblest.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It therefore seems to me that to remain unmarried is to flout the will of Heaven.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And what,” asks Beauchamp, bending upon Waverhouse his sad and serious gaze, “do you, sir, think of that?”“I think you have stated an unanswerable case.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I fear that this old bachelor will never enter the sphere of perfect bliss.”“If you get yourself a wife, you’ll have made it doubly sure that bliss will not be yours.” My master croaks from the bottom of the grim well of experience.“Be that as it may,” says Beauchamp, “we young bachelors will never grasp the meaning of life unless we open our hearts and minds to the elevating spirituality of the arts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That is why, in the hope that I might learn to improve myself by playing the violin, I am so particularly interested to hear more of Coldmoon’s interrupted account of his actual experience.”“Ah, yes,” says Waverhouse, “we were going to hear the tale of our own young Werther’s fiddling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Please tell us now.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I promise, no more interruptions.” With this belated acknowledgement of his habitual failing,Waverhouse at last shut up.But the spirit of Waverhouse, like the monstrous Hydra itself, is not easily suppressed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Cut off one head, and in its place grow two.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Silence Waverhouse, and Singleman gives tongue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“No man ever,” he waffled,“became a better man by virtue of a violin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would be intolerable if universal truth were accessible through self-abandonment to mere fun.Truly to lose the self and thus to achieve the ultimate reality of the identity of self and non-self, a man must be willing to hang by his nails from a cliff, to let go, and to fall to that death in which his spirit may be reborn.” With these pomposities Singleman sought to reprove Beauchamp’s frivolous materialism; however, he might as well have saved his breath, for Beauchamp knows nothing of Zen and, as his next dry words revealed, has no desire to do so.“Really?” he comments.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“You may be right, but I remain convinced that art is the clearest expression of the highest human aspirations, and I am not to be shaken in that conviction.”“Good for you,” says Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I shall be glad to speak of my artistic experience to so congenial a soul.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, as I was saying, I had great difficulties to contend with before I could even start learning the violin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Can you imagine, Mr. Sneaze, the agonies I suffered merely to buy a violin?”“Well, I assume that in a place so generally God forsaken as not to have even hemp soled sandals for sale, it can’t have been easy to find a shop that offered violins.”“Oh, there was shop, alright.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And I’d saved up cash enough for a purchase.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But it wasn’t as simple as that.”“Why not?”“Because if I bought a fiddle in a dorp that small, everyone would know, and its brute inhabitants would immediately have made my life unbearable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Believe you me, anyone out there who was thought to be the least bit arty had a very thin time.”“Genius is always persecuted,” sighed Beauchamp with deep sympathy.“There you go again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I do wish you’d stop calling me a genius.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s an embarrassment.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, every day as I passed that shop where the fiddles were displayed, I’d say to myself, ‘Ah, how wonderful it would be just to hold one in my arms, to be the owner of a fiddle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Oh, how I wish and wish that one of them were mine.’”“Quite understandable,” commented Waverhouse.“But it’s distinctly odd,” my master mused in a voice where his usual bilious perversity was overlaid with genuine wonder, “that some otherwise sensible lad should wander about a backwoods hamlet drooling over a violin.”“It simply proves what I’ve just been saying.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Drooling’s a sign of genius.”Only Singleman held aloof, vouchsafing nothing and twisting his foolish beard.“Perhaps you’re wondering how there came to be violins available in such a graceless place, but the explanation’s quite simple.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There was, you see, a ladies academy in the neighborhood, and, since the curriculum included daily violin-practice, the local shopkeepers were quick to exploit such a captive market.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, the violins were of poor quality; more rustic gues than genuine violins.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And the shop-folk treated them very roughly, hanging them up at the shop entrance in bunches of two or three, like so many vegetables.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet, as one passed the shop, one could hear them humming in the wind or, in response to some shopboy’s casual finger, quivering into sound.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Their singular timbre, every time I heard it, thrilled my heart to such a pitch of excitement that I felt it could but burst.”“That sounds dangerous.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There are, of course, many varieties of epilepsy, such as that brought on by the sight of water and that provoked by the presence of crowds.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But our young Werther,” says Waverhouse—never one to miss an opportunity to wallow in the absurd—seems unique in suffering seizures at the thrumming of fiddle strings.”But the plodding Beauchamp, prosaic even in his passion for the poetic, wouldn’t recognize a flight of fancy if it landed on his nose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“It’s not a matter for mockery,” he snaps.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“No man can truly be an artist unless he has sensitivities as keen as Coldmoon’s.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I say again, Coldmoon is a genius.”Coldmoon still looks restless to have such greatness thrust upon him.“No, no,” he says, “maybe it really is some epileptic variant; but the fact remains that the timbre of those sounds moved me to the core.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve played and heard the violin time and again since then, but nothing ever has matched the beauty of that random music.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There are no words to convey the faintest echo of its magic.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”Nobody paid the slightest attention to Singleman when, rather aptly as it seemed to me, he quoted from an obscure Taoist text: “Only from gems, the jewels in its hilt, could such sweet sounds have issued from the sword.” I felt sorry, not only for Singleman but for Chuang-tzu, too, that the words were left to die.“Day after day for many months, I walked past that shop, but I heard that marvelous music only thrice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the third occasion I decided that, come what might, I would have to buy a violin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Reproof from the people of my own district, sneers from the slobs in neighboring prefectures, thumpings organized by my fellow students, fist-lynchers to a man, not even formal expulsion from the school could budge me from my resolution.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I had no choice but to satisfy my all-consuming need.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I would buy a violin.”“How characteristic of genius.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That drive, that total concentration upon fulfillment of an inner need.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ah, Coldmoon, how I envy you!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How I have longed, lifelong and always in vain, to experience feelings of such vehemence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I go to concerts and I strain my ears until they ache in an effort to be carried away, but for all my full-hearted striving, nothing seems to happen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How you must pity,” said Beauchamp in tones that mixed black sadness and green envy, “us earth-bound clods.”“Count yourself lucky,” Coldmoon answers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I can speak of my enthrallment now with relative calm.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But then it was pure agony.Excruciating agony.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, my masters, in the end I took the plunge and bought a violin.”“Say on.”“It was the eve of the Emperor’s birthday, in November.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Everyone in my lodgings had gone off to some hot spring for the night, and the place was empty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d reported sick that day and, absenting myself from school, had stayed in bed, where, all day long, I nursed the single thought: this evening I’ll go out and get that violin.”“You mean you played truant by shamming illness?”“That’s right.”“Talent indeed,” says Waverhouse lost in wonder.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Perhaps he really is a genius.”“As I lay with my head sticking out of the bedclothes, I grew impatient for the nightfall.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To break the tension, I ducked beneath the covers and, with my eyes closed tight, entreated sleep; which did not come.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So I pulled my head back out, only to find the fierce autumn sun still fully ablaze on the paper-window six feet long.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which niggled me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I then noticed, high up on the paper-window, a long stringy shadow which, every so often, wavered in the autumn wind.”“What was that long, stringy shadow?”“Peeled, astringent persimmons strung like beads on raffia cords suspended from the eaves.”“Hmm.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What happened next?”“Next, having nothing else to do, I got up from bed, opened the paper-window and went out onto the veranda.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There I detached one of the persimmons that had dried to sweetness, and ate it.”“Did it taste good?” My master can be trusted, whatever the subject, to find some childish question to be asked.“Excellent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Persimmons down there really are superb.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You will not taste their like anywhere in Tokyo.”“Never mind the persimmons.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What did you do next?” This time it was Beauchamp who was pressing for clarification.“Next, I ducked back into bed again, closed my eyes and breathed a silent prayer to all the gods and Buddhas for nightfall to come soon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It then seemed that three, perhaps four, long hours had passed; so thinking the evening must have come, I brought my head out from under the bed clothes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To my surprise, the fierce autumn sun was still fully ablaze on the six-foot paper-window, and, on its upper part, those long and stringy shadows were still swaying.”“We’ve heard all that.”“The same sequence happened again and again.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, I got up from bed, opened the paper-window, ate one persimmon that had dried to sweetness, went back to bed, and breathed a silent prayer to all the gods and Buddhas for nightfall to come soon.”“We don’t seem to be making much progress with that promised story about learning to play the violin.”“Don’t rush me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just listen, please.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, having endured the next three, or perhaps four, hours in my bed until, I thought, surely it must now be evening, I popped my head up out of the covers only to find the fierce, autumn sun still fully ablaze on the paper window while, on its upper part, the long stringy shadows were asway.”“You’re getting us nowhere.’“Then, I got up from bed, opened the paper-window, went out onto the veranda, ate one persimmon dried to sweetness and.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“So you ate another one?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is there no end to your dreary guzzle of persimmons dried to sweetness?”“Well, my impatience grew worse.”“Your impatience!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What about ours?”“You want everything so rushed along that I find it hard to continue my story.”If Coldmoon finds it hard, so does his audience; even the devoted Beauchamp makes little whimpers of complaint.“If you all find listening too hard, I have no choice but to bring my story abruptly to its end.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In short, I repeated this oscillation between eating persimmons and ducking into bed until all the fruit were gone.”“By the time you’d guzzled that lot the sun must surely have gone down.”“As a matter of fact, it hadn’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After I’d eaten the last persimmon I ducked back into bed, and in due course popped my head out yet again, only to find the fierce autumn sun still fully ablaze upon that six-foot paper-window.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“I’ve had enough of this.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It just goes on and on.”“Me too.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m bored stiff with the way you tell your tiresome story.”“But it isn’t easy on me, you know.”“With the degree of perseverance you have already proven you possess, no enterprise whatsoever could be too difficult.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If we had sat here uncomplaining, your autumn sun would have gone on blazing until tomorrow morning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tell me this: do you, and if so when, intend to buy that violin?” Even the indefatiguable Waverhouse is showing signs of wear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Singleman alone seems unaffected by the slow unrolling (or rather the slow unrolling and rerolling) of Coldmoon’s quaint account.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For all he cared, Coldmoon’s autumn sun could go on blazing all through the night; even, perhaps, until the day, or days, beyond tomorrow.Coldmoon, too, shows no sign of strain.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Calm and composed, he drones on with his story.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Someone has asked me when I intend to buy my violin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The answer is that I intend to go out and buy it just as soon as the sun has set.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is hardly my fault that, whenever I peer out from the bedclothes, the autumn sun is still so brilliantly ablaze.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Oh, how I suffered!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was far, far worse, that deep impatience in my soul, than this superficial irritation which seems, so pettily, to irk you all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After I’d eaten the last of the hanging persimmons and saw the day still bright, I could not help but perish into tears.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Beauchamp, my dear fellow, I felt so reft of hope that I wept, I wept.”“I’m not at all surprised.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Your weeping does you credit.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All artists are essentially emotional and their tears are distillations of the truth of things.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nevertheless, one does rather wish that you could speed things up a bit.” Beauchamp’s a decent-hearted creature and, even when he’s knee deep in absurdities, maintains his earnest manner.“Much as I’d like to speed it up, that laggard sun won’t set.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Its hang-up is most hard to bear.”“Your endlessly unsetting sun is no less hard on us, your tanned and sweating audience.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, let’s forget the whole interminable tale before its lentor kills us.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Scrub it, Coldmoon,” says my master who is now quite clearly nearing the end of his tether.“You’d find it harder still if we stopped at this point.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For we are now coming to the really interesting part of the story.”“All right then.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We’re prepared to listen, but only on condition that the sun goes down.”“That’s a pretty tall order, but all things yield to my revered teacher, and lo the sun has set.”“How extraordinarily convenient.” Singleman uttered his toneless comment with so much nonchalance that everyone broke into laughter.“So night, at last, had fallen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You can perhaps imagine my relief.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With great stealth I slipped out of my lodgings into the quietness of Saddletree, for so that huddle of poor dwellings had been named.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My nature shrinks from noisy places so that, despite the obvious conveniences of a city life, I had at that time chosen to withdraw from the whirl of the world and to live secluded in a snail shell of a dwelling, a farmhouse miles from anywhere in a corner of the countryside scarce trodden by the foot of man.”“That ‘scarce trodden by the foot of man’ seems to be piling it on a bit,” objects my master.“And that touch about the ‘snail shell dwelling,’” adds Waverhouse, “is insufferably bombastic.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why don’t you say, ‘in a tiny room, too small even to have an alcove?’That would sound much better, if only because a great deal less affected.”But Beauchamp, as he immediately makes clear, finds the description praiseworthy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Whatever the facts of the room’s dimensions, Coldmoon’s phrasing is poetic.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I find it very pleasing.”The meticulous Singleman chips in with a serious enquiry.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“It must have been an exhausting business trudging there and back to school from such a remote shack.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How many miles, roughly, would you say?”“Perhaps five hundred yards.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You see, the school itself was in the remote village.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“In that case, many of its students would have been boarded in nearby lodgings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is that correct?” asks Singleman in relentless tones which suggest the far-off baying of bloodhounds.“Yes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Most of the farm dwellings had one or two student lodgers.”“Yet, did you not describe the place as scarcely trodden by the foot of man?” Singleman moves in for the kill.“I did indeed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But for the school the place would have been virtually uninhabited.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, let me tell you how I was dressed as I slipped out into lonely Saddletree in that deepening dusk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Over a padded handwoven cotton kimono, I wore the brass-buttoned overcoat of my school uniform.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"With the overcoat’s hood pulled well down over my head to make sure I’d not be recognized, I drifted along the road in such a way as not to attract attention.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Being November, the road from my lodgings to the Southern Highway was thick with fallen persimmon leaves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Every step I took set the dead leaves scurrying, and their rustle behind me seemed proof that I was being followed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I turned and looked back, the dense mass of the Tōrei Temple, blacker even than its surrounding forest, loomed up black above me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As you may know, that temple is the family shrine of the Matsudaira Clan.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"An extremely quiet and little-visited building, it lies at the foot of Mount Kōshin not more than a hundred yards from where I was then living.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"well yes, Hawaii.”“Hawaii?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That’s quite startling,” said a startled Waverhouse.“I walked some two hundred yards along the Southern Highway, entered the township from Eagle Lane, turned into Old Castle Street, up Great Bushel Road and so past First Street, Second Street, and Third Street, all running off Main Street which itself runs parallel to the Road of the Cost of Food.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"From there I took Owari Street, Nagoya Street, and the Street of the Magic Dolphin into Fishball Lane and thence.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"What we want to know,” my master rudely interrupts, “is whether or not you bought a violin.”“The man who sells musical instruments is Kaneko Zenbei so, using parts of his own name, he calls his shop Kane-zen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But to reach the shop, sir, we’ve still some way to go.”“Forget the distance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just go and buy a violin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

Oh no.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not that again.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How often this time are you going to scorch us with the blazing repetition?” On this occasion it was Waverhouse who raised the fire alarm.“Friends, have no fear.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s only a passing kind of blaze that lights your immediate horizon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It will, I do assure you, flicker and die down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, as I peer through the light blaze from the shop, I can see a faint reflection of that glare shining from the polished body of a violin while the roundness of its pinched-in waist gleams almost coldly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So falls the lantern’s light across its tightly drawn strings that only a section of the fiddle’s stringing flings out at me its glistening darts of silver.”“Now that,” says Beauchamp almost moaning in his pleasure at the words, “is a truly masterly piece of description.”“That’s the one, I thought, that’s the one for me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The blood began pounding in my head and my legs so weakened they could barely hold me up.”Behind a scornful smile, Singleman grunted.“Instinctively, and with no further thought, I rushed into the shop, yanked out my purse, pulled from it a couple of five-yen notes and.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

If I act rashly I may bungle things.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Should I not pause for deeper reflection?’ So, at the eleventh hour, I reined myself in.”“Sweet heaven,” groaned my master, “d’you mean to say that even now, after we’ve slogged along behind you across such veritable Australias of balderdash, you’ve still not bought your fiddle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You really do drag things out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And all for some piddling contraption of cheap wood and catgut.”“It is not, sir, my intention to drag things out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I can’t help being unable to buy it.”“Why can’t you?”“Why can’t I?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Because it’s still too early in the evening.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There were still too many people passing by.”“What does it matter if there are two or even three hundred people in the streets?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldmoon, you really are an extraordinary man,” my master shouted in his anger and frustration.“If they were just people,” says Coldmoon, “even a thousand, even two thousand of them, of course it wouldn’t matter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But many of them were in fact my fellow students; prowling about with their sleeves rolled up and with bludgeons in their hands.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There’s a particular group, the Dregs, who pride themselves on being permanently at the bottom of the class.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I had to be careful because louts of that kind are invariably good at judo, and I dared not take the risk of any kind of tangle with them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For who knows where even the most trivial brush with violence may end?Of course, I yearned to have that violin, but I was also fairly anxious to remain alive.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I preferred to go on breathing without playing a violin to lying dead for having played it.”“Then am I right in thinking that you didn’t buy a fiddle?” My master struggles on in search of certainties.“Oh, but I did make a purchase.”“Coldmoon, you’re driving me mad.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you’re going to buy a fiddle, buy it; if you don’t want to buy one, don’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But for the sake of my sanity, please settle the matter one way or the other.”Coldmoon grinned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Things settle themselves,” he said, “and all too rarely in the way one had most hoped.” With careless care he lit a cigarette and blew out smoke at the ceiling.I think it was the smoke which finally snapped my master’s patience.In any event, it was at this point that he abruptly rose to his feet, went off into his study and, returning with a musty-looking, foreign book, lay down flat on his stomach and began to read.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Singleman had earlier slipped away unremarked, and is now sitting in front of the alcove playing go by himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The plain fact is that Coldmoon’s story has proved so boringly long that, one by one, his listeners have abandoned him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Only two of them are still sticking it out: Beauchamp with his unquenchable faith in art and Waverhouse to whom longeur is second nature.Coldmoon somewhat crudely blew out a last long stream of smoke and resumed telling his story at the same leisurely pace.“Having decided that an immediate purchase of that violin would be ill timed, I now had to decide upon a suitable timing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The early part of the evening had already been found too dangerous and the shop would of course be closed if I came too late.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Clearly the ideal time would be somewhere before closing time but after the prowling students had all retired to their lairs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet to identify the precise best moment of purchase was not, as I’m sure you, Beauchamp, will appreciate, at all easy.”“I can see it would be difficult.”“Eventually, I fixed upon ten o’clock as the best time for action.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But what should I do until then?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I didn’t much like the idea of going back to my lodgings only to sneak out again; while visiting some friend for a time-wasting chat struck me as too selfish.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I accordingly decided to pass the waiting period in a simple stroll around town: two or three hours, I thought, could always be quickly and congenially consumed in such a leisured ramble.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But on this particular evening so leadenly the time dragged by that I understood as deeply in my heart as if I myself had coined that ancient line which says, ‘A single day seems long as a thousand autumns.’” Coldmoon twisted his features into a pattern which he presumably considered expressive of the agonies of waiting and, confident of some suitable reaction from Waverhouse, turned the full glare of his faked distress upon that subtle aesthete.Nor was he disappointed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Waverhouse would interrupt the announcement of his own death sentence for the sake of hearing himself babble, and Coldmoon’s look of open invitation was utterly irresistible.“As I recall,” he immediately responded, “the old song tells us not only that it is painful to be kept waiting by the beloved but also, as one might of course expect, that the waiter feels more pain than the awaited.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So perhaps that eaves-strung violin actually experienced more bitter pains of waiting than did you on your aimless and dispirited wandering around town like some clueless detective.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
‘Dispirited’ is a splendid word.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Isn’t it the Chinese who say, ‘dispirited as an unfed dog in a house of mourning?’ Indeed, there’s nothing more dismal than the whining of a homeless dog.”“A dog?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s cruel.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve never before been likened to a dog.”“As I listen to your story I feel as though I were reading the biography of some ancient, master artist, and my heart brims with sympathy for your sufferings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Our tame comedian Waverhouse was only trying to be funny when he compared you with a dog.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Take no notice of his nonsense but pray continue with your story.” Beauchamp pours oil on potentially troubled waters, but Coldmoon in truth needs neither encouragement nor consolation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Come what may, he’s going to tell his story “Well,” he continues, “I wandered up Infantry Road and, along the Street of a Hundred Houses and thence, through Money-changers’Alley, into the Street of the Falconers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

".”“Was it yet ten o’clock?”“Not yet, I’m sorry to say.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I drifted across Dyer’s Bridge and as I walked eastward along the river path I passed a home bound group of three masseurs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Somewhere in the distance dogs were howling at the moon.”“To hear, on an autumn night by the riverside, the distant barking of dogs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That sounds like some scene-setting speech from a Kabuki play.You, Coldmoon, are cast as the fugitive hero.”“Have I done anything wrong?”“You are about to do something frightful.”“That’s a bit much.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All I’m going to do is to buy a violin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If that’s to be considered criminal, every student at every school of music must be guilty of crime.”“Criminality is not determined by any absolute standard of good or evil.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The acts of a criminal may actually be good in absolute terms but, since they have not been recognized as good by the consensus of public opinion enshrined in the law, they will be treated, and punished, as crimes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is extremely difficult to establish what, in truth, is a crime.For what is truth?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Christ himself in the context of his society was a criminal and was punished as a criminal.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of the bloodline from King David, he was accused by his fellow Jews of wishing to be a king.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He did not deny the charge, which naturally was very serious to the Roman governor of that conquered province, and the plaque on his crucifix, ‘The King of the Jews,’ identified his crime.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, does our handsome Coldmoon deny being an artist in a society where artists are regarded as offensive?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of lusting after a violin in a community where such a filthy emotion is virtually criminal?”“All right,” says Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I acknowledge my guilt.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But what worries me is how to pass the time until ten o’clock finally deigns to arrive.”“Nonsense,” replies Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“You can run through, yet again, that time consuming naming of the names of streets.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If that doesn’t work, you can haul up your dear, old autumn sun for a few more bouts of blazing.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And what about those persimmons, sun-dried, of course, to sweetness?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m sure you could eat at least another three dozen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That sort of stuff will keep you going until ten, and I’m prepared to listen for as long as you like.”Coldmoon had the grace to break into a broad grin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Since you’ve taken the very words from my mouth, I won’t insist on using them myself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, by an artistic distortion of the truth, all of a sudden it’s ten o’clock.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Right on that appointed hour I returned to Kane-zen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The streets were deserted, and the sound of my wooden clogs was desperately lonely.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The big outer shutters had already been hoisted into place across the front of the shop and only the paper sliding door of its small side entrance was still available for use.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I slid that light door open, I was again assailed by a vaguely uneasy feeling that some sneaky dog was still slinking along behind me.”At this point, my master glanced up from his grubby-looking book and asked, “Have you bought that violin yet?”“He’s just going to buy it now,” said Beauchamp.“What!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He still hasn’t bought it after all this time?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Buying fiddles must be an arduous business,” my master mutters to himself and turns back to his reading.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Singleman, who has by now practically covered the whole board with black and white pieces, maintains his disinterested silence.“Summoning up my courage, I dived into the shop and, with my head buried in my hood, said that I wanted a violin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Several shop boys and young assistants who were sitting chattering around a brazier looked up in surprise and stared at my half hidden face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Automatically, with my right hand, I tugged the hood still lower.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I had asked for a second time to be shown a violin, the boy sitting nearest me, who’d been trying to peer up under my hood, got to his feet and, with a half-hearted ‘Certainly, sir,’ slouched off to the front of the shop and came back with a tied cluster of some four or five.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In response to my question, he said a violin cost five yen and twenty sen.“‘As cheap as that?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
These must be only toys.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Are they all the same price?’“‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘all the same price.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All exactly the same and all strongly and carefully constructed.’“I took out my purse and extracted from it one five-yen note and a twenty-sen silver coin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then I wrapped the violin in a big cloth I’d specially brought for that purpose.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Apart from myself and the inquisitive shop boy, no one in the shop had spoken a word since I entered.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They just sat there watching me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since my face was well concealed, I knew there was no risk of being recognized, but I still felt nervous and anxious to get back out to the street as quickly as possible.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At long last, with my cloth wrapped treasure tucked inside my overcoat, I left the shop.‘Thank you, sir,’ they chorused as I did so, and my blood ran cold.Outside, I glanced quickly up and down the street.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was pretty well empty; except that, perhaps a hundred yards away, I could hear some two or three voices quoting Chinese poems at each other in accents so loud as to waken the whole town.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Edgy as ever and fearing lest the loudness of the voices forewarned of a troublesome incident with argumentative drunks, I slipped away westward around the corner of the shop, hurried along beside the moat until I came out on to Drug King’s Temple Road.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then, passing through Alder Village to the foot of Mount Kōshin, I at last got back to my lodgings.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And the time was ten to two.”“Then you’ve been walking practically the whole night long,” exclaimed Beauchamp with his usual admiring sympathy.“So!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At long, long last it’s over,” says Waverhouse with impolitely obvious relief.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“The way it went on and on, it was like traveler’s backgammon.”“But it’s only now,” protests Coldmoon, “that we come to the really interesting part.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So far it’s only prelude.”“More to come?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But that’s terrible.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You can’t expect the patience of your audience to last out through a full recital after such an exhausting prelude.”“I only hope that, for their own sakes, my audience will bear with me.To break off now would be, as the saying has it, to have plowed a field and then to forget to sow the seed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I shall therefore press on.”“My dear chap,” says Waverhouse, “what you decide to say is entirely up to you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For my part, I shall simply sit and hear whatever it is I’ll hear.”“What about you, my revered master?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Will you consent to be so gracious as to hearken to my stumbling tale?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"May I mention, sir, that I have already bought a violin.”“So what are you now proposing?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
To sell it?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I see no reason to listen to an odyssey of sale.”“I am far from selling it.”“In that case there’s even less need to listen.”“Your decision grieves me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well then, Beauchamp, it seems that only you have the kindness and discriminating taste to hear me out.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I confess it’s all a bit discouraging.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But never mind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ll do my best to be brief.”“You needn’t be brief.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Take your time.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I Find your story fascinating.”“Well now, where was I?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ah yes, back safely in my lodgings, the proud possesser after so many vicissitudes of my precious violin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But my troubles were not over.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First, I didn’t know where to keep it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"All sorts of visitors were accustomed to dropping in on me, so I couldn’t just leave it about the place where they would immediately spot it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I dug a hole and buried it, it would have been tiresome to dig it up whenever I wanted to play.”“Quite so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Could you perhaps hide it up in the ceiling?”“I was lodged in a farmhouse, so the ceilings had no boards.”“That was hard.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Where did you put it then?”“Where do you think I put it?”“I’ve no idea.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the space where the storm boards for the windows can be slid away?”“No.”“Wrapped up in your bed clothes and tucked away in the bedding cupboard?”“No.”While Beauchamp and Coldmoon continue with their guessing game, my master and Waverhouse become engrossed in a totally separate conversation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“How do you read these lines?” my master asked.“Which lines?”“These two lines here.”“What’s this then?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Quid aliud est mulier nisi amicitie inimica.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But it’s Latin.”“I know it’s Latin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But how do you read it?”“Come off it, Sneaze,” says Waverhouse evasively as his sensitive nose scents danger, “you’re always bragging about your knowledge of dead languages.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Can’t you read it yourself?”“Of course I can.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Quite easily.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I’m asking you for your reading of this particular text.”“You know how to read it, and yet you ask me what it means.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That’s a bit thick, you know.”“Never mind if it’s thick or thin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just translate the Latin into English.”“Tut-tut.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such giving of orders, such military ways.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
D’you take me for your batman or something?”“Don’t slide away from the question behind a military smoke screen.Just be so good as to let me hear your version of these two lines.”“Let’s leave your Latin problems for the moment.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’m keen—aren’t you?—to keep up with developments in Coldmoon’s extraordinary story.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He’s just coming to a crisis point, trembling between discovery and the successful caching of his treasure.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Am I not right, Coldmoon?Well, how then did you cope with your dilemma?” Waverhouse evinces a sudden new enthusiasm for Coldmoon’s fantasy on a violin and moves over to rejoin the fiddle group.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My wretched master, I regret to say, is left alone with his text.Encouraged by this unexpected attention, Coldmoon proceeded to explain where he’d hidden his violin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I ended up,” he said, “by smuggling it away into the old, varnished, wicker box that my grandmother had given me for storing clothes when I’d first left home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was her parting gift to me, and she herself I seem to remember, brought it into the family as part of her own bridal gear.”“Such an antique would hardly seem to sort with a brand-new violin.What do you think, Beauchamp?”“I agree they sound a poor match.”“But you yourself suggested the ceiling, and that,” said Coldmoon, squashing Beauchamp, “is hardly a good match either.”“Despite the oddity of Coldmoon’s hideyhole, his decision strikes me as the very stuff of haiku.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So let’s not start a squabble.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How about this?In an ancient, wicker box a hidden violin:A feeling of utter lonesomenessAs the autumn closes in.”“Today you’re fairly oozing with little squibs.”“Not just today.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Day in, day out, they well up in my mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My knowledge of the art is so profound that even the late, great Masaoka Shiki was struck dumb by its depth.”“Goodness, did you know Shiki?” asked the honest-hearted Beauchamp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His voice rose in serious enquiry and he sounded thrilled actually to know someone who had known the late, great, master poet.“We were never physically close,” said Waverhouse, “but we were always directly in warm contact by a kind of spiritual telepathy.” Shocked, even disgusted, by this ridiculous answer, Beauchamp fell silent.Coldmoon merely smiled and went on with his own improbable story.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Having decided on how to hide it, my next problem was how to make use of it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I foresaw no trouble about taking it out from its wicker box and looking at it, but such mere gloating would hardly suffice.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I needed to be able actually to play it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But the resulting sounds would scarcely pass unnoticed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Therein lay a particular danger because the leading bully-boy of those damnable Dregs happened to lodge in the boarding house immediately south of mine: the two buildings were, in fact, separated only by a scrawny hedge consisting of a single row of Roses of Sharon.”“That was stinking luck,” Beauchamp chimes in sympathetically.“Stinking luck indeed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For one cannot mask a telltale sound.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As we all well know, the whereabouts of the luckless Lady Kogō were betrayed to the vengeful Taira by the sound of her harp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If,” says Waverhouse, “you were merely guzzling stolen food or faking paper money, that could be managed, but one cannot scrape a fiddle and keep one’s presence hidden.”“If only my fiddle made no sound, I could have gotten away with it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“You speak as though sound were the only betrayer, but there are soundless things which still can not be hidden.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I remember that years ago, when we were self-catering students lodging in a temple over in Koishikawa, one of our gang, a certain Suzuki Tō, was passionately fond of sweetened, cooking saké.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He used to keep it in a beer bottle, never offered it around but swigged it all by himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One day, when Suzuki was out for a walk, the otherwise decent Sneaze, very unwisely, nicked Suzuki’s bottle, took a couple of gulps and then.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“That’s a flat lie.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I never touched Suzuki’s stuff.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was always you who were knocking it back,” exclaimed my master suddenly and in a loud voice.“Oh, so you’re still with us, are you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’d thought you were so busy in your book that I could safely tell these terrible truths without fear of interruption by the guilty party.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But all the time you were listening.Which just shows what a sneaky, saké sneaking sort of fellow you are.One talks of people who are equally skilled in thought and action.Thought and faction are more your style.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I don’t deny that, now and again, I took a modest nip from Suzuki’s bottle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But you were the villain who got found out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And how did you come to be caught?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just listen to this, you two.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We all know, don’t we, that our miserable host is anyway incapable of serious drinking.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Alcohol!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He just can’t take it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But just because that cooking saké belonged to someone else, he slugged it down as though his life depended on it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Imagine what inevitably followed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
His face swelled up and turned a ghastly red.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was a most fearsome sight.”“Pipe down,Waverhouse!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You can’t even read Latin.”“That’s a laugh!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You want a laugh?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then listen to the sequel.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When Suzuki got back, he made a beeline for his grog, lifted the bottle, shook it, and immediately discovered it was more than half empty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Sneaze had really given it a hammering.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course Suzuki realized that someone had been at it and, when he looked around, there was Sneaze flat out in a corner, as stiff and dully scarlet as some crude, clay doll.”Remembering that ludicrous incident, Waverhouse exploded into raucous laughter and the others joined in.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even my master chuckled into his book.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only Singleman seems proof against low comedy.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s probably overstrained his Zen-besotted mind with all those bits of stone.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, slumped down across the board, he’s fallen fast asleep.When his guffaws had ended,Waverhouse began again, “I remember another occasion when a noiseless action nevertheless betrayed itself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d gone,” he said, “to a hot spring inn at Ubako where I found myself sharing a room with some old man who was, I believe, a retired draper from Tokyo.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since he was no more to me than a temporary roommate, it hardly matters whether he was a retired draper or a practicing second-hand clothes dealer, but I thought you’d like a bit of background detail.In any event, he got me into trouble.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That is to say, after some three days at the inn I ran out of cigarettes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ubako is an out-of-the-way place, miles up in the mountains with only a single inn and absolutely nothing else.One can eat and one can bathe in the hot springs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But that’s all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Imagine what it’s like to run out of fags in Ubako.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It put me under strain.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When one is deprived of something, one begins to crave for it as never before.Though I’m not much of a smoker, the moment I realized I was out of cigarettes I found myself aching for a puff.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What made it worse was that the old man had brought with him a big stock of cigarettes carefully bundled up in a carrying cloth, from which he would take out several at a time, squat down right in front of me, and chain-smoke like a sooted chimney.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If he’d smoked in an ordinary decently human sort of way, I would not have hated him so passionately, but he flaunted his tobacco wealth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He made smoke rings, blew the fumes out forward, sideways, straight up at the ceiling, in and out of his nostrils, and almost out of his ears until I could have killed him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Some men are born show-offs.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This man was a smoke-off.”“What d’you mean, a smoke-off?”“If you flaunt your clothes or jewelry, you’re a show-off; if you flaunt your fags, you’re a smoke-off.”“If it put you through such agony, why didn’t you simply ask him to let you have a few of his cigarettes?”“There are things a man can’t do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To beg, I am ashamed.”“So it’s wrong to ask for a cigarette?”“Perhaps not actually sinful, but I could never beg.”“Then what did you do?”“As a matter of fact, I stole.”“Oh, dear!”“When the old man, clutching his personal hand towel, tottered off for a hot spring bath, I knew my chance had come.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I looted his hoard and I smoked and smoked and smoked as fast as I could go.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just as I was smirking to myself, partly with the pleasure of smoking, partly with the even greater self-satisfaction of the successful thief the door opened and there he was again.”“What happened to his bath?”“Oh, he was certainly planning to take it, but when he’d gone some way down the corridor he suddenly remembered he’d left his purse behind so he came back to get it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Damn cheek!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
As if I’d steal someone’s purse.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Well, wouldn’t you?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You seem to have been pretty quick with his cigarettes.”“You must be joking.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s not the same at all.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, apart from his disgraceful behavior in that matter of the purse, the old man proved a person of real feeling.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When he opened the door, the room was thick with at least two days worth of cigarette smoke.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ill news travels fast, they say.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It didn’t take him long to read the situation.”“Did he say anything?”“He hadn’t lived all those years without growing more shrewd than that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Saying nothing, he wrapped some fifty or sixty cigarettes in a piece of paper; then, turning to me, he courteously observed, ‘Do please forgive their miserable quality, but if these cigarettes could be of any use to you, I’d be honored if you’d accept them.’Then he went off down to the bath.”“Perhaps that’s what’s meant by ‘the Tokyo style.’”“I don’t know if it’s Tokyo style or draper’s style; anyway, after that incident, the old man and I became firm friends and we spent a most enjoyable two weeks together.”“With free fags for a fortnight?”“Since you ask me, yes.”My master finds it difficult to give in gracefully, but he sometimes tries.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He accordingly closed his book, rolled off his stomach and said, as he sat up, “Have you finished with that violin?”“Not yet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We’re just coming to the interesting part, so do please listen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
As for that person flaked out on the go board—what was his name?—What?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Singleman?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, I’d like him to listen, too.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s bad for him to sleep so much.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Surely it’s time we woke him up.”“Hey, Singleman, wake up.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Wake up.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This is an interesting story.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Do wake up.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They say it’s bad for you to sleep so much.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Your wife is getting anxious.”“Eh?” Singleman lifted up his face.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Slobber had dribbled down his goatee to leave a long shining line as if a slug had trailed its slime across him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I was sleeping,” he managed to get out, “like a white cloud on the mountain top.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve had a delightful nap.”“We’ve all seen how delightfully you sleep.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Suppose you wake up now.”“I expect it’s time I woke.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Has anyone had anything to say worth hearing?”“Coldmoon’s been telling us about his violin.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
He’s just about to.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.What was it he was going to do?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Come on, Sneaze.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What was it?”“I haven’t the foggiest idea.”Coldmoon intervened.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I am,” he said, ‘just about to play it.”“He’s going to play his violin at last.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Come over here and join us as we listen.”“Still that violin?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Bother.”“You’ve no cause to be bothered because you’re one of those people who only play on stringless harps; Coldmoon here has every reason to be bothered out of his tiny skull because his screeching squawks are heard all over the neighborhood.”“Ah, yes?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldmoon, don’t you yet know how to play a violin without being heard by your neighbors?”“No, I don’t.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If there is such a way, I’d very much like to learn about it.”“There’s really nothing to learn.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Just concentrate, as all the Zen masters advise, on the pure, white cow which stands there in the alley.Desire will drop away from you and, as enlightenment occurs, you’ll find you already know how soundless music can be played.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And because you’ll already know, you’ll have no need to learn.” Singleman’s distorted messages from the Gateless Gate, even when he’s wide awake, are usually incomprehensible.But Coldmoon simply assumed that the man babbled like that because his brains were still floating about somewhere in the land of Nod.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So he deliberately ignored him and continued with his story.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“After long thought I devised a plan.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The next day, being the Emperor’s Birthday, was a national holiday and I proposed to spend it in bed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I felt restless all day long and I kept getting up, first to lift and then to replace the lid of my wicker box.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When, in due course, the daylight faded and the crickets in the bottom of my grandmother’s parting gift began to chirrup, I took my courage in both hands and lifted the violin and its bow from their biding place.”“At wonderful last,” chirruped Beauchamp, “Coldmoon’s going to play.”“Take it easy, now,” warns Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Gently, gently, Coldmoon.Don’t do anything hasty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let caution rule your twilight.”“First I took out the bow and examined it from its tip to its guard.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“You sound like some half-witted seller of swords,” chaffed Waverhouse.“If you can take a bow in your hands and feel that it is your own soul that you’re holding, then you will have achieved that same spiritual condition which transfuses a samurai when he unsheathes his white-honed blade and dotes upon it in the failing light of autumn.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Holding that bow in my hands I trembled like a leaf.”“Ah, what a genius!” sighs Beauchamp.“Ah, what an epileptic,” adds Waverhouse tartly.“Please,” said my master, “please get on with playing it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And right away.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now.”Singleman makes a wry face as though acknowledging the pointless-ness of trying to bring light to the invincibly ignorant.“Happily the bow proved in perfect condition.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Next I took the violin and, holding it close under the lamp, examined its front and back.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Hush!” calls Waverhouse commandingly.“It’s you yourself who do the interrupting.”“Oh, I see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I beg your pardon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Pray carry on.”“With the violin beneath my arm, soft-soled sandals on my feet, I had taken some few steps beyond the outer glass door of my lodgings when.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“I knew it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I knew it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I knew in my bones there was going to be a breakdown.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Coldmoon cannot walk two steps or breathe two minutes without a hitch or hang-up.”“I suppose you do realize,” said my master at his most sarcastic, “that there are no more dried persimmons hanging from the eaves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Even if you’re now very hungry there’s no point in turning home for them.”“It is highly regrettable that two such scholars as you and you”—Coldmoon nodded at Waverhouse and Sneaze— “should persist in behaving like common hecklers.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I shall have to address my further remarks to Mr. Beauchamp only.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, Beauchamp, as I was saying, though I had left my lodgings, I was obliged to turn back for something I should need.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thereafter, having draped around my head a scarlet blanket (for which I’d paid three yen and twenty sen in my own hometown before I left it years before), I blew out the lamp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unfortunately, in the consequent pitch darkness I could not find my sandals.”“But why did you want to go out?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Where were you off to?”“Patience, patience.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I shall come to that.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"At long last, outside in my scarlet blanket, my violin beneath my coat, I again found myself as on the previous night, ankle deep in fallen leaves under a star lit sky.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I turned away to the right and, as I came to the foot of Mount Ko-shin, the boom of the temple bell on Eastern Peak struck through my blanket shrouded ears and penetrated to my inmost head.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Beauchamp, can you guess what time it was?”“This is your story, Coldmoon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve no idea what the time was.”“Beauchamp, it is nine; nine and the evening chill.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I am now climbing through the early autumn darkness along a mountain path which rises nearly three thousand feet to a sort of terrace plateau which the locals call Big Flat.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Timid as I am, at any other time I’d have been scared clean out of my wits, but it’s one of those strange things that, when the mind is truly concentrated upon one specific aim, all sense of being frightened or not frightened is wiped from one’s heart.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Odd as it must sound, I had become a lion-heart by virtue of my single-minded lust to play a fiddle.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This place, Big Flat, is a famous beauty spot on the south flank of Mount Ko-shin.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Looking down from there on a fine day, one can see through the red pines the whole layout of the castle town below.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d guess the level area must cover some four hundred square yards and, smack in the middle of it, a large, flat rock protrudes to form a low fifteen-square-yard platform.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On the north side of Big Flat there’s a swampy pond called Cormorant’s Marsh, and around the pond there’s nothing but a thick stand of quite enormous camphor trees, each one no less than three arm-spans around.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The place is deep in the mountains and the only sign of man is a small hut used by the camphor gatherers.Even by day the pond oppresses the visitor with its air of sodden gloom.Remote as it is, Big Flat is not too hard to visit because, on some long-ago maneuvres, the Corps of Engineers cut a pathway up the mountain-side.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When I finally reached the flat rock, I spread out my scarlet blanket and sat down on it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’d never climbed up here before on a night so cold and, as my pulse steadied, I began to feel the surrounding loneliness encroach upon me as a kind of cramp creeping ever deeper into my belly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When one is thus alone in the mountains the sheer intensity of that loneliness can fill the mind with a feeling of terror; but if that feeling can be emptied away, all that remains in the mind is an extraordinary sense of icy crystalline clarity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
For some twenty minutes I sat there on my scarlet rug completely abstracted from my normal self and feeling as though I were totally alone in a palace of pure crystal.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was as though every bit of me, my body, even my soul, had become transparent, as if made of some kind of quartz, and I could no longer tell whether I was inside that palace of crystal or that freezing palace was within my belly.”Not quite sure how to react to Coldmoon’s strange account, Waverhouse contented himself with a style of teasing more demure than his mocking wont.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“How terrible,” he said.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Singleman, however, was genuinely impressed by Coldmoon’s personal report of a state of consciousness not unknown to many meditation sects.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Quite extraordinary,” he observed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Most interesting.”“Had my condition of cold translucency persisted, I might well have stayed frozen on that rock until I melted in the morning sun.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Then I should never have played my violin.”“Have there been any earlier reports,” Beauchamp asked, “to suggest that Big Flat might be haunted?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You know, by foxes, badgers, or any other such shape-changing creatures?”“As I was saying, I couldn’t even tell whether I was my own self or not, and I scarcely knew if I were alive or dead when suddenly I heard a harsh screaming cry from the far end of the old marsh.”“Aha,” says Waverhouse, “things are happening.”“This awful cry, like a blast of autumn wind tossing the treetops, echoed away far and deep across the entire mountain; at its sound, I came to myself with a jerk.”“What a relief!” sighed Waverhouse, heaving a grotesquely simulated sigh.“As the masters say, ‘One must perish into life.’ Isn’t that so, Coldmoon?” Even Singleman, who winked as he offered his observation, now seems disposed to treat his friend’s spiritual experience in the spirit of light farce.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, his Zen reference was completely lost on Coldmoon.“Having been thus startled back into my usual self, I looked around me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The whole vast mountain was now dead quiet: nothing, not even the drip of a raindrop, could be heard.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What then was that ghastly cry?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Too piercing to have been human, too loud for any bird.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Could it have been a monkey?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But around there there aren’t any monkeys.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What on earth could it have been?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Once that question had entered my head and I began to search around for its answer, all the demons of misgiving who had hitherto lain quiet in the crannies of my mind erupted into pandemonium.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You remember how the city crowds went wild, people running here and there and even all over each other in a lunacy of welcome, when Prince Arthur of Connaught came to Tokyo in February 1906?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, inside my head it was worse than that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And then things suddenly came to a crisis.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I felt my very pores gape open and through their yawn my body’s flightiest visitors—Courage, Pluck, Prudence, and Composure departed from me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Like cheap alcohol blown in a spray on hairy shins to cool them, my visitors evaporated.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Under my ribs my heart began to hammer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It leapt and danced like a red frog.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My legs trembled like the humming strings of a kite.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And my nerve broke.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In mindless panic I grabbed my scarlet blanket around my head and, with the violin clutched beneath one arm, I scrambled down from the low flat rock and helter-skelter fled away down the rough mountain path.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When, scampering like a rat through the layers of dead leaves, I came at last to my lodgings, I crept in quietly and hid myself in my bed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I had been so exhausted by terror that I fell immediately asleep.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"D’you know, Beauchamp, that was the most terrifying experience of my whole life.”“And then?”“That’s it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There isn’t any more.”“No playing of the violin?”“How could I possibly have played?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you had heard that eldritch cry, I bet my boots the last thing you’d have thought about would be playing a violin.”“I find your story less than satisfactory.”“Perhaps so, but it was the truth.” Coldmoon, vastly pleased with himself, surveyed his audience.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Well,” he said, “and what did you think of it?”“Excellent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A point well taken,” laughed Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“You really must have gone through great travail to bring your story to that remarkable conclusion.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In fact, I’ve been following your account with the closest attention, for it seemed increasingly clear to me that, in the person of yourself, these Eastern climes have perhaps been visited by a male reincarnation of Sandra Belloni.” Waverhouse paused in the obvious hope that someone would give him an opportunity to air his knowledge of Meredith’s heroine by asking for clarification of this obscure reference.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But all the members of his audience, having been caught that way before, held their peace; so Waverhouse, regrettably uncued, simply rattled on.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Just as Sandra Belloni’s harp playing and Italian song in a moonlit forest called down the goddess of that silver orb, so Coldmoon’s near performance with a violin upon the ledges of Mount Ko-shin called up some phantom badger from a fen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There is, of course, a difference of degree but the principle’s the same.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What I find peculiarly interesting is that such a slight difference in degree should produce so vast a difference in result: in Sandra’s case a manifestation of ethereal beauty, but in Coldmoon’s nothing but crude and earthy farce.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That must have been a painful disappointment to you.”“No disappointment at all,” said Coldmoon who seemed genuinely uninterested, perhaps not in his own weird experience, but certainly in Waverhouse’s question.“Trying to play a violin on a mountain top!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What effete behavior!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It serves you right that you got scared silly.” My master’s scathing comment showed his usual lack of sympathy with anything beyond the world of his own wizened imagination.Singleman piped in:“How more than pitiful it is to findThat one must live one’s human life confinedWithin a world of an inhuman kind.”None of Singleman’s mangled quotations from the works of deluded medieval metaphysicians ever makes the least sense to Coldmoon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Or to anyone else.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps not even to Singleman.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His words were left to float away into the nothingness of a long silence.After a while, Waverhouse changed the subject by asking, “Incidentally, Coldmoon, are you still haunting the university in order to polish your little, glass balls?”“No.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My visit home rather interrupted things.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Indeed, I doubt if I’ll ever resume that line of research.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was always, if you’ll pardon the joke, something of a grind, and lately I’ve been finding it a real bore.”“But without your polished beads, you won’t get your doctorate,” says my master, looking slightly worried.Coldmoon seems no more concerned about his doctorate than he was with his failure to become a Japanese version of Sandra Belloni.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Oh that,” he says with a careless laugh.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I’ve no longer any need for a degree.”“But then the marriage will be canceled and both sides will be upset.”“Marriage?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Whose marriage?”“Yours.”“To whom am I supposed to be getting married?”“To the Goldfield girl.”“Really?”“But surely you’ve already plighted your troth?”“I’ve never plighted anything.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I had no part in the spread of that particular rumor.”“That’s a bit thick,” says my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I say, Waverhouse, you, too, remember that incident, don’t you?”“Incident?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You mean that business when the Nose came shoving herself in here?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If so, it’s not just you and I who’ve heard about the engagement, but the world and his wife have long been in on the secret.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As a matter of fact, I’m constantly being pestered by some quite respectable newspapers who want me to let them know when they may have the honor of printing photographs of Coldmoon and his blushing Opula in their Happy Couples column.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"What’s more, Beauchamp there finished his epic epithalamium, ‘A Song of Lovebirds,’ at least three months ago and has since been waiting anxiously to learn the right date for its publication.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You don’t want your masterpiece to rot in the ground like buried treasure just because Coldmoon’s grown bored with buffing up his little, glass beads, do you, Beauchamp, eh?”“There’s no question of pushing for early publication.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, my very heart and soul have gone into that poem, but I am happily convinced that it will remain suitable for publication at any appropriate time.”“There, you see: the question of whether or not you take your degree has wide and potentially painful repercussions.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, pull yourself together.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Get those beads rubbed spherical.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Polish the whole thing off.”“I like the joke in your phrasing, and I’m truly sorry if I’ve given any of you cause to worry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But I really do not any longer need a doctorate.”“Why not?”“Because I have already got my own wife.”“I say, that’s grand!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
When did this secret marriage take place?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Life is certainly full of surprises.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, Sneaze, as you’ve just heard, Coldmoon has apparently acquired a wife and children.”“No children yet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It would be terrible if a child were born after less than a month of marriage.”“But when and where did you ever get married?” demanded my master as though he were the presiding judge at some official court of inquiry.“As a matter of fact, during my recent trip home.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
She was there waiting for me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Those dried bonitos were one of the wedding presents from her relatives.”“Three miserable dried bonitos!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That was rather a stingy gift.”“No, no.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There were scads of them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I only brought you three.”“So your bride is from your own home district?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Does it then follow that she’s on the dark skinned side?”“Yes, she’s dark complexioned.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Exactly right for me.”“And what are you going to do about the Goldfields?”“Nothing.”“But you can’t just leave things, poof like that,” my master bleated.“What do you think,Waverhouse?”“I think he can.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The girl will marry someone else.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After all, marriage is little more than two people bumping against each other in the dark.If they cannot manage such bumping by themselves, other people contrive their blind collision.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It doesn’t much matter who bumps whom.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In my opinion, the only person deserving our tears and pity is the unfortunate author of ‘A Song of Lovebirds.’”“Thank you, but please don’t worry.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My epithalamium, as it stands, is perfectly suitable for dedication to Coldmoon on the already achieved occasion of his marriage.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I can easily write another when Opula gets wed.”“Ah, that marvelous, heartless professionalism of the true poet,” sighed Waverhouse, “whipping out a masterpiece at the drop of a hat.Easy as a wink of an eye.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One’s heart is cramped with jealousy.”“Have you notified the Goldfields?” My master is still touchingly concerned about the feelings of that granite clan.“No, and why should I?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I never proposed to the girl or asked her father for her hand in marriage.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I have no reason whatsoever to say a single word to either of them.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Moreover, I’m sure they’ve already learned the last least detail from those dozens of detectives they employ.”My master’s face, as the word “detectives” entered his ear, immediately turned sour.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“You’re right, Coldmoon, tell such people nothing,” and he proceeded to offer the following comments on detectives as though they were all weighty arguments against observing the proprieties in handling a broken engagement.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Persons who snatch property from the unwary in the streets are called pickpockets; those who snitch the thoughts of the unwary are called detectives.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Those who jimmy open your doors and windows are called thieves; those who use leading questions to lever out one’s private thoughts are called detectives.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Those who threateningly jab their swords into one’s floor matting as a way of forcing the surrender of money are called armed burglars; those who by the jabbing menace of their words force one into admissions against one’s will are called detectives.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To my way of thinking, it inexorably follows that pickpockets, thieves, armed burglars, and detectives are all spawn of the same subhuman origin, things unfit to be treated even as men.Their every endeavor should be thwarted and they themselves quite mercilessly put down.”“Don’t work yourself into such a lather.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m not frightened by detectives, even though they should appear by the battalion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Let all be warned with whom they will be dealing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Am I not the King of the Glass Ball Polishers, Avalon Coldmoon B.Sc.?”“Bravo!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Well spoken!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s the stuff to give ’em!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just the spirited words one would expect from a newly married bachelor of science.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, Sneaze,” Waverhouse continued, “if you categorize detectives with such grubs as pickpockets, thieves, and common robbers, where do you place a creature such as Goldfield who gives employment to such vermin?”“Perhaps a modern version of that long departed villain, Kumasaka Cho-han.”“Oh yes, I like that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Cho-han, as I recall it, was said to have disappeared when he was sliced in half.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But our modern version over the way, squatting on a fortune made by blatant usury, is so intensely alive in his meanness and sharp greediness that, cut in a million pieces, he’d reappear as a million Cho-han clones.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would be a lifelong source of trouble if such a blood-sucking creature ever came to believe he had a bone to pick with you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So be careful, Coldmoon.”“To hell with that!",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I shall face him down with the sort of speech you hear from heros of the Ho-sho- style of Noh play.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You know what I mean.‘Pretentious thief though well aware of my fearsome reputation, you yet dare break into my house.’ That should stop him short.” Coldmoon, unwisely careless of the real dangers he might have to cope with from a vengeful Goldfield, strikes a series of dramatic poses.“Talking of detectives, I wonder why it is that nearly everyone nowadays tends to behave as detectives do.” In strict accordance with his usual style, Singleman begins his observations by reference to the matters under discussion and then veers off into complete irrelevance.“Perhaps,” says Coldmoon kindly, “it’s because of the high cost of living.”Beauchamp mounts his hobbyhorse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I myself believe it’s because we have lost our feeling for art.”“It’s because the horns of modern civilization are sprouting from the human head and the irritations of that growth, like nettles in one’s underwear, are driving us mad.” It’s a pity that Waverhouse, who is both well-read and intelligent, still should strive to be merely clever.When it came to my master’s turn, he opened the following lecture with an air of enormous self-importance.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“I have, of late, devoted considerable thought to this topic and I have concluded that the current marked trend toward detective-mindedness is entirely caused by the individual permitting himself too strong a realization of the self.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By that I do not mean self-realization of the spiritual nature which Singleman pursues in his Zen search for his ‘unborn face,’ that self he was before he contrived to be born.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Nor do I mean that other form of Zen self-realization where, by either gradual or sudden enlightenment, the mind perceives its own identity with heaven and earth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Dear, dear, this is becoming rather heavy going.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if Sneaze, you really do propose to make an exhaustive and scholarly analysis of the psychological maladies of our times, I feel that I,Waverhouse in person, must be granted an opportunity to lodge a full complaint against the civilization I seek to grace.”“You are always free to say what you like.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But generally you don’t say anything.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You just talk.”“On the contrary, I have a very great deal to say.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was you, Sneaze, who, only a brief week back, fell down and worshiped a police detective.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet here you are today, making ugly comparisons between detectives and pickpockets.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You are an incarnation of the principle of contradiction.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whereas I am a man who, through every earlier life right to this present day of my present incarnation, has never wavered in the certi-tudes of my opinions.”“Police detectives are police detectives.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The other day is the other day.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And today’s today.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Never to change one’s opinions is to demonstrate a petrifaction of mind that prevents its least development.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To be, as Confucius put it in the Analects, willfully ignorant beyond all hope of education, is, my dear Waverhouse, to be you.”“That’s really rather rude.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Still, even a detective when he tries to speak his honest mind can be rather sweet.”“Are you calling me a detective?”“I simply meant to say that, since you are not a detective, you’re an honest man, and that that’s good.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"There, there.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No more quarrels.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Let’s listen to the rest of your formidable argument.”“The heightened self-awareness of our contemporaries means that they realize only too well the wide gap between their own interests and those of other people; as the advance of civilization daily widens that gap, so this so-called self-awareness intensifies to a point where everyone becomes incapable of natural or unaffected behavior.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"William Henley, the English poet, once said that his friend Robert Louis Stevenson was so continuously unable to forget himself that, if he happened to be in a room with a mirror on the wall, he could not pass in front of the glass without stopping to study his reflection.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Stevenson’s condition is a telling example of the general modern trend.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Because this overweening consciousness of self never lets up, not even when one sleeps, it is inevitable that our speech and behavior should have become forced and artificial.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We impose constrictions on ourselves and, in that process, inhibitions on society.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In short, we conduct our whole lives as if we were two young people at their first meeting in the context of a marriage negotiation.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Words such as serenity and self-composure have become no more than so many meaningless strokes of a writing brush.It is in this sense that people nowadays have become like detectives and burglars.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A detective’s job is essentially to make profit by being sneaky and self-effacing; only by cultivating an intense awareness of himself can he even believe in his own existence.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To no less a degree the rapacious burglar is obsessed with me, me, me, because the thought of what will happen to him if he’s caught is never out of his mind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Modern man, even in his deepest slumber, never stops thinking about what will bring him profit or, even more worrying, loss.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, as with the burglar and the detective, his self-absorption grows daily more absolute.Modern man is jittery and sneaky.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Morning, noon, and night he sneaks and jitters and knows no peace.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not one single moment’s peace until the cold grave takes him.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That’s the condition to which our so-called civilization has brought us.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And what a mess it is.”“Most interesting.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A penetrating analysis of our case,” says Singleman who rarely resists any opportunity to thicken the clouds when high flown, cloudy matters are discussed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I consider Sneaze’s explanation is very much to the point.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the old days, a man was taught to forget himself.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Today it is quite different: he is taught not to forget himself and he accordingly spends his days and nights in endless self-regard.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Who can possibly know peace in such an eternally burning hell?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The apparent realities of this awful world, even the beastliness of being, are all symptoms of that sickness for which the only cure lies in learning to forget the self.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This dire situation is well summarized in that ancient Chinese poem whose author was one of thoseWho simply sit and, sitting all night throughUnder a drifting moon, themselves withdrewThemselves from Self and thereby came to beFree of the world and from all Being free.Modern man lacks naturalness even when performing acts of genuine kindness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The English, as is well-known, are vastly proud of being nice, both in the sense of their refined behavior and in the sense of common kindness; however, one may fairly suspect the hearts behind the niceness of the English as packed with self-regard.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps I might remind you of the story of that member of the English royal family who, during some visit to India, was invited to a banquet.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Among those present was an Indian prince who, momentarily forgetful of the nature of the occasion but perfectly naturally in terms of Indian custom, reached out for a potato, picked it up in his fingers and put it on his plate.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Realizing his gaffe, he was terribly ashamed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But the English gentleman, immediately and with apparently equal naturalness, proceeded to help himself to potatoes with his fingers.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
An act of the most refined and kindly politeness?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Or an act so-seeming but ultimately taken in order that it should be remembered, as it clearly has been, to the enhancement of English royalty?”“Is it the English custom,” asks Coldmoon, missing the point of the story, “to eat potatoes with their fingers?”Disregarding Coldmoon’s question, my master spoke.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“I’ve heard another such story about the English.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
On some occasion at their barracks in England a group of regimental officers gave a dinner in honor of one of their non-commissioned officers.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Toward the end of the meal, when finger bowls filled with water were placed in front of each diner, the non-commissioned officer, a man not used to banquets, lifted the bowl to his mouth and swallowed the water down in a single gulp.Immediately, the colonel of the regiment raised his own finger bowl in a toast to the non-commissioned officer’s health and gulped its water down.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His lead was promptly followed by every officer present.”“I wonder if you’ve heard this one,” says Waverhouse who does not like to remain silent.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“When Carlyle was presented to the queen, he, being an eccentric and anyway a man totally unschooled in court procedures, suddenly sat down on a chair.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All the chamberlains and ladies-in-waiting standing ranged behind the queen began to giggle.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, not quite.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They were about to start giggling when the queen turned around toward them and signaled them also to be seated.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Carlyle was thus saved from any embarrassment.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I confess I find this courtly courtesy somewhat elaborate.”“I don’t suppose,” said Coldmoon rather shortly, “that, being the man he was, Carlyle would have been the least embarrassed if only he and the queen were seated while all the rest stayed standing.”“To be self-aware when one is actually being kind to other people may be all right,” Singleman started up again, “but being self-aware does make it that much harder to be genuinely kind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is widely held that the advance of civilization brings with it a moderation of combative spirit and a general easing of relationships between individuals.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But that’s all nonsense.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When individual awareness grows so strong, how can mutual gentleness be expected?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s true of course that modern relationships seem superficially calm and easy-going, but they are in fact extremely tough; rather like the relationship between two sumo wrestlers who, immobilized by cross-grips in the middle of the ring, are nevertheless butting each other with their vast potbellies as hard as they can heave.”“In former times disputes were settled by the relatively healthy means of brute force, whereas nowadays the means and mentality have become so specialized that the intensity of the combatant’s self-awareness has inevitably increased,” says Waverhouse, taking it to be now his turn to talk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Sir Francis Bacon observed in his Novum Organum that one can only triumph over nature by obeying the laws of nature.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is it not peculiar that modern quarrels so closely follow the pattern identified by Bacon in that, as in a jūjutsu contest, one defeats one’s opponent by an exploitation of that opponent’s own strength.”“Or again, it is, I suppose, something like the generation of hydro-electricity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"One makes no effort to oppose the flow of water, but merely diverts its force into the production of power.”Coldmoon had obviously only just begun to express an interesting idea, but Singleman butted in to add, “And therefore, when one is poor, one is tied by poverty; when rich, entrapped in wealth; when worried, tangled by anxiety; and when happy, dizzied by happiness.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A talented man falls at the hand of talent, a man of wisdom is defeated by wisdom, and a quick-tempered man like Sneaze is quickly provoked into rashness and goes rushing headlong out into the deadfalls dug by his artful enemies.”“Here, here,” cried Waverhouse clapping his hands.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And when my master, actually grinning, said, “Well, you won’t in practice catch me quite as simply as that,” everyone burst out laughing.“By the way, I wonder what sort of thing would finish off a fearful fellow like Goldfield?”“His wife will obviously be toppled over by the weight of her nose, while the hardness of his heart will crush that usurer to death.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His henchmen will be trampled to death by stampeding detectives.”“And the daughter?”“Well, I’m not sure about her, and I have never in fact clapped eyes on her.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But it seems likely that she’ll be suffocated by clothes or food or even drinking.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I can’t imagine that she’ll die of love, though I suppose she might end up as a roadside beggar like that fabled beauty O-no-no-Komachi.”“That’s a bit unkind,” objected Beauchamp who, after all, had written some new-style poems for the girl.“And therein lies the importance of the moral injunction that one must have a merciful heart and never lose one’s subjectivity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Unless one reaches and sustains that condition of mind, one will suffer torment throughout eternity.” That benighted Singleman waffles on as usual as though he were the sole proprietor of enlightenment.“Don’t be such a moralizing twerp.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The chances are,” said Waverhouse, “that you will meet your just deserts upside-down in one of your own oft-quoted flashes of Zen lightning.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the spring, of course.”“One thing at least is certain,” said my master.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“If civilization continues its rapid development along its present lines, I would not wish to live and witness it.”“The choice is yours.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As Seneca advises, no man should carp at life when the road to freedom runs down every vein.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Why don’t you do yourself in?”Waverhouse helpfully enquired.“I care rather less for dying than I do for living.”“No one seems to pay much attention when he’s being born, but everybody makes no end of a fuss about his departure.” Coldmoon offers his own cool comment.“It’s the same with money,” says Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“When one borrows money, one does so lightly, but everyone worries like crazy when it comes to paying it back.”“Happy are they who don’t worry about repayment; as happy as those who do not worry about death,” intoned Singleman in his most lofty and unworldly style.“I suppose you’d argue that the bravest in the face of death are those who are most enlightened?”“Most certainly.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Perhaps you know the Zen phrase ‘The iron-ox-heart of an iron-ox-face: the ox-iron-heart of an ox-iron-face?’”“And are you claiming to be so ox-and-iron-hearted?” Waverhouse, who happened to know that the phrase meant to have a heart so strong as to be undisturbed by anything, doubted that Singleman would dare make such a claim.“Well, no, I wouldn’t go that far.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But,” said Singleman for no very obvious reason, “the fact remains that neurasthenia was an unknown ailment until after people became worried about death.”“It’s plain that you must have been born and bred before the invention of nervous prostration.”This weird dialogue held so little interest for Coldmoon and Beauchamp that my master had no difficulty in retaining them as an audience for a further airing of his grievances against civilization.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“The key question,” he announced, “is how to avoid repaying borrowed money.”“But surely no such question can arise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anything borrowed must always be repaid.”“All right, all right.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Don’t get so up in the air.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This is just a discussion between intelligent men, so listen and don’t interrupt.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I ask how can one borrow without repaying in order to lead in to the parallel question as to how can one contrive to avoid dying.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though it is no longer much pursued, that used to be the key question: hence the ancient concern with alchemy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, the alchemists achieved no real success and it soon became deadly clear that no human being could ever dodge death.”“It was deadly clear long before the alchemists confirmed it.”“All right, but since this is just an argument, you just listen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Right?Now, once it became clear that everyone was bound to die, then the second question arose.”“Indeed?”“If one is certain to die, what’s the best way to do so?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That is the second question.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Once this second question had been formulated, it was only a matter of time before the Suicide Club would be founded.”“I see.”“It is hard to die, but it is much harder if one cannot die.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Victims of neurasthenia find living far more painful than any death.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet they remain obsessed with death; not because they shun it, but because they fret to discover the best means to that much desired end.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The majority will lack the common sense to solve the problem.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
They will give up and leave nature to solve it for them or society itself will bully them to death.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But there will also be a handful of awkward customers who will be unwilling to endure the slow death of such bullying.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They will study the options into death and their research will lead to marvelous new ideas.Beyond all doubt, the main characteristic of the future will be a steady rise in suicides and, almost certainly, every self-destructor will be expected to work out his own original method of escape.”“People will be put to a great deal of trouble.”“Yes, they most certainly will.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Henry Arthur Jones has already written a play in which the leading figure is a philosopher who strongly advocates suicide.”“Does he kill himself?”“Regrettably, no.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But within a thousand years everyone will be doing it, and I am prepared to bet that in ten thousand years time nobody will even think of death except in terms of suicide.”“But that will be terrible.”“Indeed it will.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By that time the study of suicide, on a foundation of years of detailed research, will have been raised to the level of a highly respected and fully institutionalized science.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
At middle schools such as the Hall of the Descending Clouds the study of suicide will have replaced ethics as a compulsory subject.”“An intriguing prospect.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A lecture course on the theory and practice of suicide might well be worth attending.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Hey, Waverhouse, have you been listening to Sneaze on the destiny of man?”“Yes I have.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
By the time of which he has just been speaking the ethics teacher at the Hall of the Descending Clouds will be holding our current concepts of public morality up to reproof and ridicule.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The young men of that far world will be instructed to abandon the barbarous customs of the ancients and to recognize that suicide is the first duty of every decent person.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Moreover, since it is eternally right to do unto others as one would wish done to oneself the moral obligation to commit suicide implies an equally moral obligation to commit murder.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consider, the teacher will say, the case of Mr. Peke Sneaze, that wretched, struggling scholar dragging out his miserable existence just across from our school.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is he not obviously agonized by his persistent breathing yet lacks the ordinary physical courage to fulfill his moral duty to do away with himself?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Is it not therefore, in common humanity, your compassionate duty to do him in?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not, of course, in any of the ancient cowardly ways involving such crudities as spears, halberds or any kind of firearm.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In this day and age we are surely civilized beyond such coarse atrocities.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No, he should be harassed unto death.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only the most refined techniques of verbal assassination should be employed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which will be not only an act of charity toward that luckless sufferer but a credit to yourselves and to the school.”“This extension lecture,Waverhouse upon Sneaze, is deeply interesting.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am truly moved by the high-mindedness of our descendants.”“Yes, but there’s even more upon which to laud our unborn heirs.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
In our ill-governed times the police are intended to safeguard the lives and property of citizens.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But in the happier times of our enlightened future, the police will carry cudgels, like dog-catchers, and go around clubbing the citizens to death.”“Why that?”“Because today we value our lives and the police accordingly protect them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When in the future, living is recognized for the agony it is, then the police will be required to club the agonized to a merciful death.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, anyone in his right mind will already have committed suicide; so the necessary objects of police attention will be only the gutless milk-sops, those mentally impaired or deranged and any persons so pitifully disabled as to be unable to destroy themselves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Additionally, anyone in need of help or assistance will, as today, just stick up a notice to that effect on the gate to his house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

.”“But is there no end to this joke?” exclaims Beauchamp from the daze of his admiration.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Before an answer could be given, Singleman began to speak, very slowly and with great deliberation, even though he still continued worrying away at his ridiculous tuft of beard.“You may call it a joke, but it might well, and better, be called a prediction.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Those whose minds are not unwaveringly concentrated upon the pursuit of ultimate truth are normally misled by the mere appearances, however unreal, of the phenomenal world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"They tend to accept what they directly see and feel, not as some empty froth of illusion but as manifestations of an eternal reality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, if someone says anything even slightly out of the ordinary, such prisoners of their senses have no choice but to treat the communication as a joke.”“Do you mean,” says Coldmoon, deeply impressed, “something like that Chinese verse about small birds being unable to understand the minds of greater birds?The swallow and the sparrow see no useIn things that, to the eagle and the goose,Are plainly useful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It could even beThat from their littleness the little seeNothing whatever of Immensity.”And he smirks with delight when Singleman, with an approving inclination of his head, says, “Something like that.”Singleman, the even plodding of his speech unspurred even by adulation, slowly continues.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

.”“Once?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s still there, isn’t it?”“That may be.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The question of time past or present is immaterial.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In any event, in Cordoba it used to be the custom that at the time of the angelus, the evening striking of the bells of churches, all the women came out of their houses and bathed in the river.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
".”“Even in winter?”“I’m not sure about that, but in any case, every female in the place—young or old—jumped into the river, and no man was allowed to join them.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The men simply looked on from a distance, and all they could see in the evening twilight were the women’s whitish forms dimly moving above the rippling waters.”“That’s poetic.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It could be made into a new-style poem.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What did you say the place was called?” Beauchamp always shows interest whenever female nudity is mentioned.“Cordoba.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, the young men thought it a pity that they could neither swim with the women nor study their form in a better light.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, one fine day, they played a little trick.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.”“Oh really?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Tell me more,” says Waverhouse immediately.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The mention of any kind of trick has, upon him, the same invigorating effect as nudity works upon Beauchamp.“They bribed the bell-ringer to sound the angelus one hour early.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The women, being such sillies, all trooped down to the riverbank as soon as they heard the bells, and there, one after another in their various states of undress, they jumped off into the water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And then, too late, they at last realized that it was still broad day.”“Are you sure that there wasn’t a fierce autumn sun ablaze?”“A great number of men were standing watching from the bridge.The women didn’t know what to do and felt terribly ashamed.”“And then?”“The moral is simply this: that one should always be wary of the common human failing of allowing oneself to be blinded by habit to basic realities.”“Not a bad little sermon.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
A tale worth remembering.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But let me give you another example, from a magazine story which I recently read, of someone rendered blind by an accustomed habit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Imagine that I’ve opened an antique shop and that, up at the front, I’ve put on display some particularly excellent scrolls and works of art.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No fakes, nothing shabby, only genuine, first-class stuff.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Naturally the prices are very high.In due course along comes some art fancier who stops and enquires about the price of a certain scroll.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I point out that the scroll is by Motonobu, that son of Masanobu who founded the Kano school in the early sixteenth century, and I then quote some quite astronomical sum, say, six thousand.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The customer replies that he likes the scroll very much but, at such a price, and not carrying such large sums of money on his person, he’ll have to let it go.”“How can you possibly know,” asks my master, ever the wet blanket, “that the customer will answer like that?”“Don’t worry, he will.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And anyway it’s only a story, so I can make my customer answer as I like.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So I then say to him, ‘Please, for those of us who appreciate Motonobu, payment is hardly the point.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If you like it, take it with you.’The customer can hardly do that.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So he hesitates.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I proceed in my friendliest manner to say that, confident that I shall be enjoying his future patronage, I would be happy to settle any difficulties about payment by accepting small sums paid monthly over a long period.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
‘Please don’t feel under any obligation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But how about a hundred a month?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Or shall we say fifty?’ Finally, after a few more questions and answers, I end up selling him the Motonobu scroll for six thousand paid in monthly installments of only a hundred.”“Sounds like that scheme in 1898 for buying the ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica Through the Times.”“The Times is reliable, an honest sort of broker, but my scheme is of a very different character.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As, if you listen carefully, you’ll see.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, Coldmoon, suppose you pay a hundred a month for my Motonobu, how long will you be paying installments?”“For five years?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Of course, isn’t it?”“Five years, of course.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Now, Singleman, do you think five years is a long time or a short time?”Singleman raised his head into its best position for the drone of Zen wisdom and intoned:“A single minute may be felt to beAs sempeternal as eternity,While ten millenia can at times go byIn the mere flicker of an adder’s eye.“By which I mean your five years could be either long or short or simultaneously both.”“You’re at it again, Singleman.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Is there some deep moral message in that quotation?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A sense of morals totally detached from common sense, eh?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, a hundred a month for five years involves sixty separate payments, and therein lies the danger of habit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one repeats the same action sixty times over, month after month, one is likely to become so habituated to payment that one also coughs up on the sixty-first occasion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And on the sixty-second.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And on the sixty-third and so on because the breaking of an established habit irks the habitue.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Men are supposed to be clever, but they all have the same weakness: they follow established patterns without questioning the reason for their establishment.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My scheme simply exploits that weakness to earn me a hundred a month until my customer finally drops dead.”“Though I like your joke,” tittered Coldmoon, “I doubt if you’ll find a great many customers so profitably forgetful.”My master, however, did not seem to find the story funny.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In a serious voice he said, “That sort of thing does actually happen.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I used to pay back my university loan, month after month on a regular basis, and I kept no count of the number of payments.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the end I only stopped because the university told me to stop.” My master seems almost to brag of his half-wittedness as though it were the benchmark of humanity.“There you are,” cries Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“You see, the reality of my imagined customer is sitting right here in front of us.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Yet that very same person, a self-confessed slave to human habit, has the effrontery to laugh at my projection of his own vision of our future civilization into its likely and unlaughable reality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Inexperienced young fellows like Beauchamp and Coldmoon, if they are not to be defrauded of their human rights, should listen very carefully for the wisdom in our words.”“I hear and shall obey.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Never, never shall I commit myself to any installment plan that involves more than sixty repayments.”“I know you still think it’s all just a joke but I do assure you, Coldmoon, that it was a truly instructive story,” said Singleman turning directly to face him.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“For instance, suppose that someone as wise and experienced as either Sneaze or Waverhouse told you that you had acted improperly in going off and getting married without advising any of the interested parties of your intentions?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Should they advise that you ought to go and apologize to that Goldfield person, what would you do?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Would you go and make your apologies?”“I should beg to be excused.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I would not demur if they wished to go and offer an explanation of my behavior.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But to go myself, no.”“What if the police ordered you to apologize?”“I should refuse all the more strongly.”“If a minister of the government or a peer of the realm asked you to apologize?”“Then, yet more firmly still, I would refuse.”“There, you see how times have changed.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Not so long ago the power of those in authority was unlimited.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Then came a time when there were certain things which even they could not demand.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
But nowadays there are strict limits upon the power of peers and even ministers to compel the individual.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"To put the matter bluntly, we are witnessing a period when, the greater the power of the authorities, the greater the resistance they’ll encounter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Our fathers would be astonished to see how things which the authorities clearly want done, and have ordered should be done, nevertheless remain undone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This era takes for granted any number of things which elderly people would once have thought unthinkable.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It is quiet extraordinary how quickly and how totally both men and their concept of society can change.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, though you may of course laugh as much as you like at Waverhouse’s version of the future, you would be wise not to laugh so hard that you fail to consider how much of it might prove true.”“Flattered as I am to have found so appreciative a friend, I feel that much more obliged to continue with my forecast of the future.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"First I would emphasize, as Singleman has already indicated, that anyone nowadays who proudly thinks himself powerful by reason of delegated authority, or who seeks to maintain an outdated power by marching around with a troop of a hundred henchmen brandishing bamboo spears, can only be compared to that antiquated bigot who imagined that his spanking palanquin could travel faster than a railway train.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I fancy that the best local example of such a fathead might actually be that usurer Goldfield, whom I consider the master fathead of them all.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So perhaps we should simply relax and leave time to slide over him.Anyway, my forecast of the future is not so much concerned with such minor transitional matters as with a particular social phenomenon that will determine the long-term destiny of the entire human race.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"My friends, if you will take a long-term view of the trends already obvious in the development of our civilization, you will have no choice but to share my view that marriage has had it.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Are you surprised?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That the sacred institution of marriage should be so summarily written off?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, the grounds for my forecast have already been stated and, I think, accepted: that modern society is centered, to the exclusion of all else, upon the idea of individuality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When the family was represented by its head, the district by its magistrate and the province by its feudal lord, then those who were not representatives possessed no personalities whatsoever.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even if exceptionally, they actually did have personalities, those characteristics, being inappropriate to their place in society, were never recognized as such.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Suddenly everything changed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"We were all discovered to possess personalities, and every individual began to assert his newfound individuality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Whenever two persons chanced to meet, their attitudes betrayed a disposition to quarrel, an underlying determination to insist that ‘I am I, and you are you,’ and that no human being was any more human than any other.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Obviously, each individual grew a little stronger by reason of this new individuality.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, of course, precisely because everyone had grown stronger, everyone had also grown proportionately weaker than their fellow-individuals.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Because it’s now harder for people to oppress you, certainly you’re stronger; but because it’s now a lot more difficult for you to meddle in other folk’s affairs, you’re clearly that much weaker.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Everyone, naturally, likes to be strong, and no one, naturally, likes to be weak.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Consequently, we all vigorously defend the strong points in our position in society, scrapping like fiends over the merest trifles, and at the same time, in an unremitting effort to undermine the position of our fellows, we lever away at their weakest points at every opportunity.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It follows that men have no genuine living space left between them which is not occupied by siege engines and counterworks.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Too cramped to live at ease, the constant pressure to expand one’s individual sphere has brought mankind to a painful bursting point and, having arrived by their own machinations at such an unpleasant state of affairs, men thereupon devised a means to relieve the unbearable pressure: they developed that system under which parents and their married offspring live separately.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the more backward parts of Japan, among the wilder mountains, you can still find entire families, including their lesser cousinage, all living together, perfectly contentedly, in one single house.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That lifestyle was only viable because, apart from the head of the family, no member of the group possessed any individuality to assert; while any member who, exceptionally, happened to possess it, took good care never to let it show.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"However, in more up-to-date and civilized communities the individual members of families are struggling amongst themselves, no less fiercely than do other and totally unrelated members of modern society, both to guard their own positions and to undermine those of their so-called nearest and dearest.There is, therefore, little real choice but to live separately.“In Europe, where the modernization of society has proceeded much further than has yet happened in Japan, this necessary disintegration of the multi-generation family unit has long been common.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If by chance European parents and sons do live in the same house, the sons pay, as they would elsewhere, for board and lodging.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Similarly, if sons borrow money from their father, they pay it back with interest as they would if they had borrowed from a bank.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This sort of laudable arrangement is only possible when fathers recognize and pay proper respect to sons’individualities.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sooner or later such customs must be adopted in Japan.It is many years now since uncles, aunts, and cousins moved out of the family unit to establish their separate lives: the time is now coming for fathers and sons to separate, but the development of individuality and of a feeling of respect toward individuality will go on growing endlessly.We shall never be at peace unless we move farther apart and give each other room for that growth.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But when parents, sons, brothers, and sisters have all so eased apart, what further easement can be sought?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only the separation of husband and wife.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Some people today still persist in the mistaken view that a husband and wife are a husband and wife because they live together.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The point is that they can only live together if their separate individualities are sufficiently harmonious.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No question of disharmony arose in the old days because, being in the Confucian phrase ‘two bodies but one spirit,’ husband-and-wife was a single person.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even after death they remained inseparable, haunting the world as two badgers from a single sett.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
That barbarous state of affairs is now all changed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"A husband now is simply a man who happens to be married, a wife a woman in the same lamentable condition.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This wife person went to a girls’ school from which, after an excellent education designed to strengthen her individuality, she comes marching out in a Western hairstyle to be a bride.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
No wonder the man she marries cannot make her do what he likes.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If such a woman did, in fact, accommodate herself to her husband’s beck and call, people would say she’s not a wife but a doll.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Now within this marriage a boundary is established, a boundary as distinct as that between oil and water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even that would not be too awful if only it were steady, but in practice the line of marital friction bounces up and down so that the whole domestic scene is in a constant condition of earthquake.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
By such experiences the human race has come to accept that it is unprofitable to both parties that married couples should live together.”“So what do they do?” asks Coldmoon.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“Divorce on the scale you imply is a worrying prospect.”“Yes, they part.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What else can they do?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s clear to me that, eventually, all married couples will get divorced.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As things still stand, those who live together are husband and wife, but in the future those who live together will be generally considered to have disqualified themselves from being a normal married couple.”“I suppose that a man like myself will be one of the disqualified.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

A philosopher will descend from heaven.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"He will preach the unprecedented truth that all members of mankind, both men and women, are essentially individuals.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Impairment of their individuality can only lead to the destruction of the human race.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The purpose of human life is to maintain and develop individuality, and, to attain that end, no sacrifice is too great.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is thus contrary to the nature and needs of mankind that the ancient, evil, barbarous practice of marriage should continue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Such primitive rites were, perhaps, understandable before the sacrosanctity of individuality was recognized, but to allow the continuation of these dreadful customs into our own civilized era is quite unthinkable.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The deplorable habit of marriage must be broken.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In our developed culture there is no reason whatsoever why two individuals should be bound to each other in the highly abnormal intimacy of the traditional marriage relationship.Once the revelations of the heaven sent philosopher have been clearly understood, it will be regarded as extremely immoral of young uneducated men and women to allow themselves to be so carried away by base and fleeting passions that they even stoop to low indulgence in wedding ceremonies.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even today we must do our best to get such tribal customs discontinued.”“Sir,” said Beauchamp so very firmly that he even slapped his kneecap,“I totally reject your vile prognostication.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In my opinion, nothing in this world is more precious than love and beauty.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It is entirely thanks to these two things that we can be consoled, be made perfect, and be happy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Again, it is entirely due to them that our feelings can be gracefully expressed, our characters made noble, and our sympathies refined.Therefore, no matter where or when one is born, here or in Timbuktu, now or in the future, love and beauty remain the eternal guidestars of mankind.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"When they manifest themselves in the actual world, love is seen in the relationship between husband and wife, while beauty shines forth either as poetry or music.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"These are the expressions, at its highest level, of the very humanity of the human race; I do not believe, so long as our kind exists upon the surface of this planet, that either the arts or our current ideal of the married couple will perish therefrom.”“It would be well, perhaps, if it were so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But, for the reasons which the heaven sent philosopher has just given for his forecast, both love and beauty are bound to perish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"You will just have to accept the inevitable.You spoke of the imperishable glories of art, but they will go the same way as the married couple: into oblivion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The irreversible development of individuality will bring ever greater demands by individuals for recognition of their singular identity.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In a world where I and you both insist that ‘I am I, and you are you,’ how can any art perdure?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Surely the arts now flourish by reason of a harmony between the individualities of the artist and of each appreciative member of his public.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

No one at all will read your poems.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Not because the poems are yours and you are a bad poet, but because individuality has intensified to such an extent that anything written by other people holds no interest for anyone.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This stage of the literary future is already evidenced in England where two of their leading novelists, Henry James and George Meredith, have personalities so strong and so strongly reflected in their novels that very few people care to read them.And no wonder.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only readers with personalities of matching force could find such works of any interest.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

That voice of his is not the voice of intrepidity and determination; it is nothing more than the whine of grievance and the screams of indignation.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It was, perhaps, an understandable reaction in a rejected philosopher.When in ancient times a truly great man appeared, all the whole world flocked to gather under his banner.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Now that the pressures of individuality are bringing on all sorts of nervous disorders, we are at last able to grasp the meaning of the ancient tag that ‘people are carefree under firm rule.’ And it won’t be long before Lao Tzu’s doctrine of the activating effect of inactivity grows to seem less of a paradox.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By then, of course, it will be too late to do anything more than recognize our likeness to addicted alcoholics who wish they’d never touched the stuff.”“All you fellows,” said Coldmoon, “seem hideously pessimistic about the future, but none of your moans and groans depress me in the least.I wonder why.”“That’s because you’ve just got married,” said Waverhouse hastening to explain away the mildest manifestation of hope.Then, suddenly, my master began to talk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“If my dear Coldmoon, you’re thinking yourself fortunate to have found a wife, you’re making a big mistake.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"For your particular information, I shall now read out something of pertinent interest.” Opening that antique of a book which he’d brought from his study a short time back, my master then continued.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"“As you can see, this is an old book but it was perfectly clear, even in those early days, that women were terrible.”“Sir, you surprise me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"You mean to say that even in those early days someone spoke ill of my wife?”“The book contains a wide variety of complaints about women, some of which will certainly apply to your wife.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
So you’d better listen carefully.”“All right.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am listening.Very honored, too.”“The book begins by saying that all men must heed the views of womanhood propounded down the ages by recognized sages.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You follow me?Are you listening?”“We are all listening.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even I, a bachelor, am listening.”“Aristotle says that, since all women are good-for-nothings anyway, it is best, if you must get married, to choose a small bride, because a small good-for-nothing is less disastrous than a large one.”“Coldmoon, is this wife of yours hefty or petite?”“She’s one of the heftier good-for-nothings.”They all laughed, more at the suddenness with which Coldmoon had rejoined the eternal conspiracy of males than at anything inherently funny in his answer.“Well,” said Waverhouse, “that’s an interesting book, I must say.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Read us some more.”“A man once asked what might be a miracle, and the sage replied, ‘A chaste woman.’”“Who, sir, is this sage?”“The book doesn’t give his name.”“I’ll bet he was a sage who had been jilted.”“Next comes Diogenes who, when asked at what age it was best to take a wife, replied,‘For a young man, not yet; for the old man, never.’”“No doubt that miserable fellow thought that up in his barrel,” observed Waverhouse.“Pythagoras says that there are three evils not to be suffered: fire, water, and a woman.”“I didn’t know,” said Singleman, “that any Greek philosopher was responsible for such an ill-considered apothegm.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Valerius Maximus in a letter to one of his friends advises him that almost nothing is impossible for a woman, and goes on to entreat God Almighty that ‘his sweet friend be not entrapped by woman’s treacherie.’ It was this same Valerius Maximus who answered his own question about the nature of woman by saying,‘She is an enemy to friendship, an inevitable pain, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desired calamity, a honey-seeming poison.’ He also remarked that, if it is a sin to put a woman away, it is surely a much greater torment to keep her still.”“Please, sir,” pleaded Coldmoon, “that’s enough.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

“Had you realized she was back?”My master permitted himself a spasm of muffled laughter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"“Oh, Mrs. Sneaze,” he called, “how long have you been home?”Answer, as the poets put it, came there none.“Did you happen to hear what your noble spouse was just telling us, Mrs. Sneaze?”Still no answer.“I hope you understand he wasn’t speaking his own thoughts.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Just reading out the opinions of a Mr. Nashe from the sixteenth century.Nothing personal.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Coldmoon giggled nervously.“Well, of course it hardly matters to me, either.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"One can’t expect to get very far in business if one goes around smoking trashy brands like Shiki-shima or Asahi.” At this point, he produced a pack of Egyptian cigarettes, selected a gold-tipped tube, lit it ostentatiously and began to puff its scented smoke.“Can you really afford to chuck your money around like that?",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
You must be rolling in the stuff.”“No.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"But a carnivore, of course.”“Never mind what you are.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Sampei, put those snaps away at once.Can’t you see,” said my master in a tone of sharp scolding, “that he’s only leading you on?”“So you don’t want an introduction to any of them,” said Sampei, half in question and half in statement, as, one by one, slowly, giving Beauchamp and Coldmoon a last chance to relent, he put the pictures back into his pocket.There was no response.“Well now, what are those bottles for?”“A present.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I bought them just now at the dramshop on the corner so that we might drink to my forthcoming marriage.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat

"Will you come with your friends?”“Me?” said Singleman apparently surprised.“Having this fishing rod to be my friend,I live at ease in nature and am freeOf every care the red-dust world might sendLike some hooked promise to entangle me.”“And what the hell is that?” asked Waverhouse.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
“Something from the hallowed guide on how to write a poem in Chinese?”“I really can’t remember where I picked it up.”“You really can’t remember?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How tiresome for you.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Well, come if your fishing rod can spare you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And you, Mr. Coldmoon, I hope I may count on you.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"After all, you have a special status in this matter.”“Most certainly I’ll be there.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It would be a pity to miss the chance of hearing my own music played by an orchestra.”“Of course.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And what about you, Mr. Beauchamp?”“Well, yes.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’d like to be there to read my new-style poem in front of the couple themselves.”“That’s wonderful.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Mr. Sneaze, sir, I’ve never before in all my life felt so pleased with the world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And, to mark the moment, I’ll have another glass of that beer.” He filled a tumbler to the brim and sank it at one go.Slowly his face turned shining red.The short autumn day has grown dark.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The charcoal fire in the brazier has long ago burnt out and its crust of ash is studded and strewn with an ugly mess of cigarette ends.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even these happy-go-lucky men seem to have had enough of their merriment and in the end it was Singleman who, climbing stiffly to his feet, remarked, “It’s getting late.Time to be on our way.” The others followed suit and, politely apopemptic, vanished into the night.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The drawing room grew desolate, like a variety hall when the show is over.My master ate his dinner and went off into his study.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His wife, feeling the autumn chill, tightens her collar, settles over her sewing box, and gets on with her remodeling of a worn-out kimono.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The children, lying in one row, are fast asleep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The maid has gone out to a bathhouse.If one tapped the deep bottom of the hearts of these seemingly lighthearted people, it would give a somewhat sad sound.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Though Singleman behaves as though enlightenment had made him a familiar of the skies, his feet still shuffle, earthbound, through this world.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The world of Waverhouse, though it may be easy-going, is not the dreamworld of those painted landscapes which he loves.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"That winsome donzel Coldmoon, having at last stopped polishing his little globes of glass, has fetched from his far home province a bride to cheer his days.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which is pleasant and quite normal, but the sad fact is that long-continued, pleasant normality becomes a bore.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Beauchamp too, however golden-hearted he is now, will have come in ten years’ time to realize the folly of giving away for nothing those new-style poems that are the essence of his heart.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As for Sampei, I find it difficult to judge whether he’ll finish up on top of the pile or down the drain, but I’d like to think he’ll manage to live his life out proud and happy in the ability to souse his acquaintance in champagne.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Suzuki will remain the same eternal groveling creeper.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Grovelers get covered in mud, but, even so be-sharned, he’ll manage better than those who cannot creep at all.As for me, I am a cat, still nameless though born two years ago, who has lived his life among men.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I have always thought myself unique in my knowledge of mankind, but I was recently much surprised to meet another cat, some German mog called Kater Murr, who suddenly turned up and started sounding off in a very high-falutin’ manner on my own special subject.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I subsequently made enquiries and discovered that my visitor was in fact the ghost of a cat who, though he’d been in Hell since dying a century ago, had become so piqued with curiosity about my reputation that he rematerialized for the express purpose of upsetting me.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This cat, I learned, was a most unfilial creature.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On one occasion when he was going to meet his mother, he was carrying a fish in his mouth to give her as a present.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
However he failed to control his animal appetites and broke his journey to guzzle the fish.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"His combination of talents and greed was such as to make him virtually human, and he even once astonished his master by writing a poem.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If such a feline culture-hero was already demonstrating superior cat skills so long as a century ago, perhaps a good-for-nothing specimen like me has already outlived its purpose and should no more delay its retirement into nothingness.My master, sooner or later, will die of his dyspepsia.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Old man Goldfield is already doomed by his greed.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The autumn leaves have mostly fallen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
All that has life must lose it.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Since there seems so little point in living, perhaps those who die young are the only creatures wise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If one heeds the sages who assembled here today, mankind has already sentenced itself to extinction by suicide.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If we don’t watch out, even cats may find their individualities developing along the lethal crushing pattern forecast for these two-legged loons.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It’s an appalling prospect.Depression weighs upon me.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Perhaps a sip of Sampei’s beer would cheer me up.I go around to the kitchen.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
The backdoor is half-open and rattles in the autumn wind.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Which seems to have blown the lamp out, for the room’s unlit.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Still, there are shadows tilting inward through the window.Moonrise, I suppose.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"On a tray there are three glasses, two of them half-filled with a brownish liquid.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Even warm water, if kept in a glass, looks cold.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Naturally this liquid, standing quietly beside the jar of charcoal existinguisher, looks, in the icy moonlight, chill and uninviting.However, anything for experience.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If Sampei, as I recall, could after drinking it become a bright, warm red and start breathing as heavily as a man who’s run a mile, perhaps it’s not impossible for a cat that drinks it to feel livelier.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, some day I, too, must die so l might as well try everything before I do.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Once I’m dead, I tell myself, it will be too late in the grave to regret that I never tasted beer.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"So, take courage and drink up!I flicked my tongue into the stuff but, as I began to lap, I got a sharp surprise.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The tip of my tongue, as though it had been pricked with needles, stung and tingled painfully.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
What possible pleasure can human beings find in drinking such unpleasant stuff?,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve heard my master describe revolting food as not fit for a dog, but this dark drink is truly not fit for a cat.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
There must be some fundamental antipathy between cats and beer.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Conscious of danger, I quickly withdrew my tongue.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But then, on reflection, I remembered that men have a pet saying about good medicines always tasting filthy and that the drafts they down to cure their colds invariably make them grimace with disgust.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I’ve never worked out whether they get cured by drinking muck or whether they’d get well anyway without the face-making business.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Now’s my chance to find out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If drinking beer poisons my entire intestines, well, that will be just too bad: but if like Sampei, I grow so cheerful as to forget everything around me, then I’ll accept the experience as an unexpected joy and even, perhaps, I’ll teach all the cats of the neighborhood how sweet it is to drown one’s woes in drink.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Anyway, let’s take a chance and see.The decision made, I drooped my tongue out cautiously.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But if I can actually see the bitter liquid I find it hard to drink it; so closing my eyes tight shut, I began to lap.When, by sheer strength of will and tigerlike perseverance, I’d lapped away the beer-lees in the first glass, a strange phenomenon occurred.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"The initial agony of my needled tongue began to ease off and the ghastly feeling in my mouth, a feeling as if some hand were squeezing my cheeks together from the outside, was pleasurably relieved.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"By the time I’d dealt with the first glass, beer swilling was no longer much of a problem.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I finished off the second glass so painlessly that, while I was about it, I even lapped up all the spill on the tray and slurped the whole lot down into my stomach.That done, in order to study my body’s reactions, I crouched down quietly for a while.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
My body is gradually growing warm.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel hot around my eyes and my ears are burning.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel like singing a song.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel like dancing the Cat’s High Links.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I feel like telling my master, Waverhouse, and Singleman that they can all go to hell.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel like scratching old man Goldfield.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel like biting his wife’s vast nose off.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I feel like doing lots of things.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And in the end I felt I’d like to wobble to my feet.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I stood up, I felt I’d like to walk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Highly pleased with myself I felt like going out.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"And as I staggered out, I felt like shouting, “Moon, old man, how goes it?” So I did.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Oh, but I felt wonderful!So this, I thought, is how it feels to be gloriously drunk.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Radiant with glory, I persevered in setting my unsteady feet one in front of each other in the correct order.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Which is very difficult when you have four feet.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I made no effort to travel in any particular direction but just kept going in long, slow wayward totter.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’m beginning to feel extremely sleepy, and indeed I hardly know if I’m still walking or already sunk in sleep.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I try to open my eyes, but their lids have grown unliftably heavy.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Ah, well, it can’t be helped.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Confidently telling myself that nothing in this world, neither seas nor mountains nor anything else, could now impede my cat-imperial progress, I put a front paw forward when suddenly I hear a loud, sloppy splash.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"As I come to my senses, I know that I’m done for.I had no time to work out how I’d been done for because, in the very moment that I realized the fact of it, everything went haywire.When I again came to myself I found I was floating in water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Because I was also in pain I clawed at what seemed its cause, but scratching water had no effect except to result in my immediate submersion.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I struck out desperately for the surface by kicking with my hind-legs and scrabbling with my fore-paws.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"This action eventually produced a sort of scraping sound and, as I managed to thrust my head just clear of the water, I saw that I’d fallen into a big clay jar against whose side my claws had scraped.All through the summer this jar had contained a thick growth of water-hollyhocks, but in the early autumn the crows had descended first to eat the plants and then to bathe in the water.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the end their splashing about and the heat of the sun had so lowered the water level that the crows found it difficult either to bathe or to drink, and they had stopped coming.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I remember that only the other day I was thinking that the water must have gone down because I’d seen no birds about.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Little did I then dream that I myself would be the next to splash about in that jar.From the water’s surface to the lip of the jar, it measures some five inches.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
However much I stretch my paws I cannot reach the lip.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And the water gives no purchase for a jump.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I do nothing, I just sink.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"If I flounder around, my claws scrabble on the clay sides but the only result is that scraping sound.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"It’s true that when I claw at the jar I do seem to rise a little in the water but, as soon as my claws scrape down the clay, I slide back deep below the surface.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
This is so painful that I immediately start scrabbling again until I break surface and can breathe.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"But it’s a very tiring business, and my strength is going.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I become impatient with my ill success, but my legs are growing sluggish.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"In the end I can hardly tell whether I am scratching the jar in order to sink or am sinking to induce more scratching.While this was going on and despite the constant pain, I found myself reasoning that I’m only in agony because I want to escape from the jar.Now, much as I’d like to get out, it’s obvious that I can’t: my extended front leg is scarcely three inches long and even if I could hoist my body with its outstretched fore-paws up above the surface, I still could never hook my claws over the rim.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Accordingly, since it’s blindingly clear that I can’t get out, it’s equally clear that it’s senseless to persist in my efforts to do so.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only my own senseless persistence is causing my ghastly suffering.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
How very stupid.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"How very, very stupid deliberately to prolong the agonies of this torture.“I’d better stop.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I just don’t care what happens next.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I’ve had quite enough, thank you, of this clutching, clawing, scratching, scraping, scrabbling, senseless struggle against nature.” The decision made, I give up and relax: first my fore-paws, then my hind-legs, then my head and tail.Gradually I begin to feel at ease.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I can no longer tell whether I’m suffering or feeling grateful.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It isn’t even clear whether I’m drowning in water or lolling in some comfy room.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
And it really doesn’t matter.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
It does not matter where I am or what I’m doing.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
I simply feel increasingly at ease.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"No, I can’t actually say that I feel at ease, either.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I feel that I’ve cut away the sun and moon, they pull at me no longer; I’ve pulverized both Heaven and Earth, and I’m drifting off and away into some unknown endlessness of peace.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am dying, Egypt, dying.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Through death I’m drifting slowly into peace.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
Only by dying can this divine quiescence be attained.,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
May one rest in peace!,Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"I am thankful, I am thankful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
"Thankful, thankful, thankful.",Natsume Soseki,I Am A Cat
