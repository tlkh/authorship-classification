"ï»¿One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he foundhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He lay onhis armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he couldsee his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiffsections.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed readyto slide off any moment.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His many legs, pitifully thin comparedwith the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as helooked.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""What's happened to me?""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
he thought.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
It wasn't a dream.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His room,a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefullybetween its four familiar walls.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"A collection of textile sampleslay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - andabove it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of anillustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It showeda lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower armtowards the viewer.Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feelquite sad.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget allthis nonsense"", he thought, but that was something he was unable todo because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his presentstate couldn't get into that position.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"However hard he threwhimself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Hemust have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that hewouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped whenhe began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never feltbefore.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Oh, God"", he thought, ""what a strenuous career it is that I'vechosen!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Travelling day in and day out.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Doing business like thistakes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and ontop of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about makingtrain connections, bad and irregular food, contact with differentpeople all the time so that you can never get to know anyone orbecome friendly with them.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It can all go to Hell!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He felt aslight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his backtowards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; foundwhere the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of littlewhite spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he triedto feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly backbecause as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.He slid back into his former position.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Getting up early all thetime"", he thought, ""it makes you stupid.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
You've got to get enoughsleep.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Forinstance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morningto copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sittingthere eating their breakfasts.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
I ought to just try that with myboss; I'd get kicked out on the spot.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But who knows, maybe thatwould be the best thing for me.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"If I didn't have my parents tothink about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd havegone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell himeverything I would, let him know just what I feel.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He'd fall rightoff his desk!,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting upthere at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,especially when you have to go right up close because the boss ishard of hearing.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Well, there's still some hope; once I've got themoney together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five orsix years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
That's whenI'll make the big change.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"First of all though, I've got to get up,my train leaves at five.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest ofdrawers.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""God in Heaven!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
he thought.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It was half past six and thehands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than halfpast, more like quarter to seven.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Had the alarm clock not rung?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Hecould see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as itshould have been; it certainly must have rung.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Yes, but was itpossible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeplybecause of that.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
What should he do now?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The next train went atseven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad andthe collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not atall feel particularly fresh and lively.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And even if he did catchthe train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the officeassistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, hewould have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a longtime ago.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, andwith no understanding.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
What about if he reported sick?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But thatwould be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years ofservice Gregor had never once yet been ill.  His boss wouldcertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurancecompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept thedoctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believedthat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And what'smore, would he have been entirely wrong in this case?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor did infact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long,feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decideto get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.There was a cautious knock at the door near his head.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Gregor"",somebody called - it was his mother - ""it's quarter to seven.Didn't you want to go somewhere?""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
That gentle voice!,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor wasshocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly berecognised as the voice he had had before.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"As if from deep insidehim, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in withit, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sortof echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whetherhe had heard properly or not.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor had wanted to give a fullanswer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contentedhimself with saying: ""Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I'm getting upnow.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The change in Gregor's voice probably could not be noticedoutside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied withthis explanation and shuffled away.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But this short conversationmade the other members of the family aware that Gregor, againsttheir expectations was still at home, and soon his father cameknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Gregor, Gregor"", he called, ""what's wrong?""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And after a shortwhile he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: ""Gregor!Gregor!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"At the other side door his sister came plaintively:""Gregor?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Aren't you well?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Do you need anything?""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor answered toboth sides: ""I'm ready, now"", making an effort to remove all thestrangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and puttinglong pauses between each, individual word.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His father went back tohis breakfast, but his sister whispered: ""Gregor, open the door, Ibeg of you.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door,and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquiredfrom his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he wasat home.The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without beingdisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast.Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well awarethat he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions bylying in bed.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain inbed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turnedout to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings wouldslowly resolve themselves today.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He did not have the slightestdoubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the firstsign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard fortravelling salesmen.It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blowhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But it becamedifficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad.He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; butinstead of them he only had all those little legs continuouslymoving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable tocontrol.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the firstone that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to dowhat he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set freeand would move about painfully.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""This is something that can't bedone in bed"", Gregor said to himself, ""so don't keep trying to doit"".The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his bodyout of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could notimagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move;it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when hecarelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he couldgather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lowerbedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lowerpart of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bedfirst, carefully turning his head to the side.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"This he managedquite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk ofhis body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head.But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into thefresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would bea miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carryon pushing himself forward the same way.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And he could not knockhimself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than loseconsciousness.It took just as much effort to get back to where he had beenearlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watchinghis legs as they struggled against each other even harder thanbefore, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringingpeace and order to this chaos.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He told himself once more that itwas not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensiblething to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could atwhatever sacrifice.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"At the same time, though, he did not forget toremind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushingto desperate conclusions.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"At times like this he would direct hiseyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, butunfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street wasenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheerto offer him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Seven o'clock, already"", he said to himself when theclock struck again, ""seven o'clock, and there's still a fog likethis.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightlyas if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things backto their real and natural state.But then he said to himself: ""Before it strikes quarter past sevenI'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And by thensomebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to meas well, as they open up at work before seven o'clock.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
And so heset himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his bodyout of the bed all at the same time.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
If he succeeded in falling outof bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he couldprobably avoid injuring it.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His back seemed to be quite hard, andprobably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Hismain concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and whicheven through all the doors would probably raise concern if notalarm.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But it was something that had to be risked.When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the newmethod was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rockback and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would beif somebody came to help him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Two strong people - he had his fatherand the maid in mind - would have been more than enough; they wouldonly have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel himaway from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient andcareful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, thelittle legs would find a use.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Should he really call for helpthough, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked?Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smileat this thought.After a while he had already moved so far across that it would havebeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Thetime was now ten past seven and he would have to make a finaldecision very soon.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Then there was a ring at the door of the flat.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""That'll be someone from work"", he said to himself, and froze verystill, although his little legs only became all the more lively asthey danced around.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
For a moment everything remained quiet.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""They're not opening the door"", Gregor said to himself, caught insome nonsensical hope.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But then of course, the maid's firm stepswent to the door as ever and opened it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Gregor only needed to hearthe visitor's first words of greeting and he knew who it was - thechief clerk himself.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Why did Gregor have to be the only onecondemned to work for a company where they immediately became highlysuspicious at the slightest shortcoming?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Were all employees, everyone of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful anddevoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that hecouldn't get out of bed if he didn't spend at least a couple ofhours in the morning on company business?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Was it really not enoughto let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries wereeven necessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and didthey have to show the whole, innocent family that this was sosuspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have thewisdom to investigate it?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And more because these thoughts had madehim upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself withall his force out of the bed.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"There was a loud thump, but it wasn'treally a loud noise.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His fall was softened a little by the carpet,and Gregor's back was also more elastic than he had thought, whichmade the sound muffled and not too noticeable.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He had not held hishead carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and inpain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Something's fallen down in there"", said the chief clerk in the roomon the left.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sortthat had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerktoo; you had to concede that it was possible.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But as if in gruffreply to this question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in hishighly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room.From the room on his right, Gregor's sister whispered to him to lethim know: ""Gregor, the chief clerk is here.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Yes, I know"", saidGregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enoughfor his sister to hear him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Gregor"", said his father now from the room to his left, ""the chiefclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn't leave on theearly train.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
We don't know what to say to him.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And anyway, hewants to speak to you personally.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
So please open up this door.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
I'msure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Then the chief clerk called ""Good morning,  Mr. Samsa"".",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""He isn'twell"", said his mother to the chief clerk, while his fathercontinued to speak through the door.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""He isn't well, please believeme.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Why else would Gregor have missed a train!,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
The lad only everthinks about the business.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
It nearly makes me cross the way henever goes out in the evenings; he's been in town for a week now butstayed home every evening.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He sits with us in the kitchen and justreads the paper or studies train timetables.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
His idea of relaxationis working with his fretsaw.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He's made a little frame, forinstance, it only took him two or three evenings, you'll be amazedhow nice it is; it's hanging up in his room; you'll see it as soonas Gregor opens the door.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Anyway, I'm glad you're here; we wouldn'thave been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he's sostubborn; and I'm sure he isn't well, he said this morning that heis, but he isn't.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""I'll be there in a moment"", said Gregor slowlyand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss anyword of the conversation.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Well I can't think of any other way ofexplaining it,  Mrs. Samsa"", said the chief clerk, ""I hope it'snothing serious.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But on the other hand, I must say that if wepeople in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately orunfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because ofbusiness considerations.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Can the chief clerk come in to see younow then?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", asked his father impatiently, knocking at the dooragain.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""No"", said Gregor.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
In the room on his right there followeda painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.So why did his sister not go and join the others?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
She had probablyonly just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
And why wasshe crying?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Was it because he had not got up, and had not let thechief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and ifthat happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with thesame demands as before?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
There was no need to worry about things likethat yet.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Gregor was still there and had not the slightestintention of abandoning his family.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"For the time being he just laythere on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was inwould seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It wasonly a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily befound for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor couldbe sacked on the spot.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
And it seemed to Gregor much more sensibleto leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking athim and crying.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But the others didn't know what was happening, theywere worried, that would excuse their behaviour.The chief clerk now raised his voice, ""Mr. Samsa"", he called to him,""what is wrong?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"You barricade yourself in your room, give us no morethan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious andunnecessary concern to your parents and you fail - and I mentionthis just by the way - you fail to carry out your business duties ina way that is quite unheard of.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"I'm speaking here on behalf of yourparents and of your employer, and really must request a clear andimmediate explanation.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"I am astonished, quite astonished.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Ithought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now yousuddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"This morning,your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure toappear, it's true - it had to do with the money that was recentlyentrusted to you - but I came near to giving him my word of honourthat that could not be the right explanation.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
But now that I seeyour incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wishwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
And nor is your positionall that secure.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"I had originally intended to say all this to youin private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no goodreason I don't see why your parents should not also learn of it.Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you thatit's not the time of year to do especially good business, werecognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do nobusiness at all,  Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""""But Sir"", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else inthe excitement, ""I'll open up immediately, just a moment.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"I'mslightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven't been able to getup.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
I'm still in bed now.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"I'm quite fresh again now, though.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
I'mjust getting out of bed.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Just a moment.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Be patient!,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
It's not quiteas easy as I'd thought.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"I'm quite alright now, though.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It'sshocking, what can suddenly happen to a person!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"I was quite alrightlast night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I hada small symptom of it last night already.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
They must have noticedit.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
I don't know why I didn't let you know at work!,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
But you alwaysthink you can get over an illness without staying at home.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Please,don't make my parents suffer!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
There's no basis for any of theaccusations you're making; nobody's ever said a word to me about anyof these things.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Maybe you haven't read the latest contracts I sentin.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well, these fewhours of rest have given me strength.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"You don't need to wait, sir;I'll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as totell that to the boss and recommend me to him!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he wassaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers - this waseasily done, probably because of the practise he had already had inbed - where he now tried to get himself upright.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He really did wantto open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speakwith the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he wascurious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him.If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor'sresponsibility and he could rest.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"If, however, they took everythingcalmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurriedhe really could be at the station for eight o'clock.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The first fewtimes he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he justslid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing andstood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious painbut he no longer gave any attention to it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Now he let himself fallagainst the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges ofit with his little legs.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"By now he had also calmed down, and keptquiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Did you understand a word of all that?""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"the chief clerk asked hisparents, ""surely he's not trying to make fools of us"".",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Oh, God!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""called his mother, who was already in tears, ""he could be seriouslyill and we're making him suffer.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Grete!,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Grete!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"she then cried.""Mother?""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
his sister called from the other side.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
They communicatedacross Gregor's room.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""You'll have to go for the doctor straightaway.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor is ill.  Quick, get the doctor.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Did you hear the wayGregor spoke just now?""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""That was the voice of an animal"", said thechief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother'sscreams.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Anna!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Anna!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"his father called into the kitchen throughthe entrance hall, clapping his hands, ""get a locksmith here, now!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran outthrough the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as theywent.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Therewas no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left itopen;  people often do in homes where something awful has happened.Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"So they couldn'tunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough tohim, clearer than before - perhaps his ears had become used to thesound.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"They had realised, though, that there was something wrongwith him, and were ready to help.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The first response to hissituation had been confident and wise, and that made him feelbetter.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, andfrom the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprisingachievements - although he did not really distinguish one from theother.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order tomake his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but takingcare to do this not too loudly as even this might well sounddifferent from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer surehe could judge this for himself.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Meanwhile, it had become veryquiet in the next room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Perhaps his parents were sat at the tablewhispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressedagainst the door and listening.Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Oncethere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holdinghimself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of hislegs.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He rested there a little while to recover from the effortinvolved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in thelock with his mouth.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He seemed, unfortunately, to have no properteeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"- but the lack of teethwas, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw,he really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact thathe must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid camefrom his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Listen"", said the chief clerk in the next room, ""he's turning thekey.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all shouldhave been calling to him, his father and his mother too: ""Well done,Gregor"", they should have cried, ""keep at it, keep hold of thelock!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And with the idea that they were all excitedly following hisefforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying noattention to the pain he was causing himself.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"As the key turnedround he turned around the lock with it, only holding himselfupright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it downagain with the whole weight of his body as needed.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The clear soundof the lock as it snapped back was Gregor's sign that he could breakhis concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself:""So, I didn't need the locksmith after all"".",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Then he lay his head onthe handle of the door to open it completely.Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wideopen before he could be seen.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He had first to slowly turn himselfaround one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefullyif he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering theroom.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable topay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerkexclaim a loud ""Oh!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", which sounded like the soughing of the wind.Now he also saw him - he was the nearest to the door - his handpressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven bya steady and invisible force.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor's mother, her hair stilldishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, lookedat his father.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forwardtowards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts thatspread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down ontoher breast.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as ifwanting to knock Gregor back into his room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Then he lookeduncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his handsand wept so that his powerful chest shook.So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside ofthe other door which was still held bolted in place.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"In this wayonly half of his body could be seen, along with his head above itwhich he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others.Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless,grey-black building on the other side of the street - which was ahospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regularline of windows piercing its facade; the rain was stillfalling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit theground one at a time.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The washing up from breakfast lay on thetable; there was so much of it because, for Gregor's father,breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he wouldstretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number ofdifferent newspapers.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"On the wall exactly opposite there wasphotograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his swordin his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forthrespect for his uniform and bearing.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
The door to the entrance hallwas open and as the front door of the flat was also open he couldsee onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way downbelow.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Now, then"", said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one tohave kept calm, ""I'll get dressed straight away now, pack up mysamples and set off.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Will you please just let me leave?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"You cansee"", he said to the chief clerk, ""that I'm not stubborn and Ilike to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous butwithout travelling I couldn't earn my living.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"So where are yougoing, in to the office?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Yes?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Will you report everything accurately,then?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable towork, but that's just the right time to remember what's beenachieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficultyhas been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligenceand concentration.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"You're well aware that I'm seriously in debt toour employer as well as having to look after my parents and mysister, so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but I willwork my way out of it again.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Please don't make things any harderfor me than they are already, and don't take sides against me at theoffice.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
I know that nobody likes the travellers.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
They think weearn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
That'sjust prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better ofit.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of thestaff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overviewthan the boss himself - it's very easy for a businessman like him tomake mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly thanhe should.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And you're also well aware that we travellers spendalmost the whole year away from the office, so that we can veryeasily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints,and it's almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort ofthing, we don't usually even hear about them, or if at all it's whenwe arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that's when we feelthe harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowingwhat caused them.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Please, don't go away, at least first saysomething to show that you grant that I'm at least partly right!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started tospeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over histrembling shoulders as he left.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He did not keep still for a momentwhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the doorwithout taking his eyes off him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He moved very gradually, as ifthere had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It wasonly when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a suddenmovement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward ina panic.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towardsthe stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural forcewaiting to save him.Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chiefclerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to beput into extreme danger.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"That was something his parents did notunderstand very well; over the years, they had become convinced thatthis job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides,they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sightof any thought for the future.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor, though, did think about thefuture.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convincedand finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family dependedon it!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
If only his sister were here!,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
She was clever; she was alreadyin tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Andthe chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him;she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him outof his shocked state.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But his sister was not there, Gregor wouldhave to do the job himself.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And without considering that he stillwas not familiar with how well he could move about in his presentstate, or that his speech still might not - or probably would not -be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through theopening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; butGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he soughtsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Hardlyhad that happened than, for the first time that day, he began tofeel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid groundunder them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; theywere even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; andhe was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally atan end.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to sideas he crouched there on the floor.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His mother was not far away infront of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, butthen she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and herfingers spread shouting: ""Help, for pity's sake, Help!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The way sheheld her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but theunthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not;she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all thebreakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quicklydown on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seemingto notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush ofcoffee was pouring down onto the carpet.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Mother, mother"", said Gregor gently, looking up at her.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He hadcompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could nothelp himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of theflow of coffee.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"That set his mother screaming anew, she fled fromthe table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her.Gregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chiefclerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister,he looked back for the last time.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor made a run for him; hewanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must haveexpected something, as he leapt down several steps at once anddisappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Theflight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor'sfather into a panic as well.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Until then he had been relatively selfcontrolled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerkhimself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him,Gregor's father seized the chief clerk's stick in his right hand(the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hatand overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with hisleft, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping hisfoot at him as he went.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor's appeals to his father were of nohelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humblyturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor's mother hadpulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands toher face.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"A strong draught of air flew in from the street towardsthe stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the tablefluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Nothing wouldstop Gregor's father as he drove him back, making hissing noises athim like a wild man.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Gregor had never had any practice in movingbackwards and was only able to go very slowly.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"If Gregor had onlybeen allowed to turn round he would have been back in his roomstraight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do thathis father would become impatient, and there was the threat of alethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father's handany moment.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had nochoice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable ofgoing backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly aspossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turnhimself round.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was ableto see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in factnow and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from adistance as to which way to turn.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
If only his father would stopthat unbearable hissing!,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
It was making Gregor quite confused.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Whenhe had nearly finished turning round, still listening to thathissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the wayhe had just come.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He was pleased when he finally had his head infront of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and hisbody was too broad to get through it without further difficulty.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Inhis present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to openthe other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough spaceto get through.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor shouldbe got back into his room as quickly as possible.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Nor would he everhave allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparationfor getting through the doorway.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"What he did, making more noisethan ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if therehad been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there wasnow more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasantexperience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway withoutregard for what might happen.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"One side of his body lifted itself,he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the whitedoor and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at allby himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the airwhile those on the other side were pressed painfully against theground.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind whichreleased him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavilybleeding, deep into his room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The door was slammed shut with thestick, then, finally, all was quiet.IIIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awokefrom his deep and coma-like sleep.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He would have woken soonafterwards anyway even if he hadn't been disturbed, as he had hadenough sleep and felt fully rested.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
But he had the impression thatsome hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the frontroom being carefully shut had woken him.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The light from theelectric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceilingand tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it wasdark.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsilywith his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value- in order to see what had been happening there.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The whole of hisleft side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar,  and he limpedbadly on his two rows of legs.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
One of the legs had been badlyinjured in the events of that morning - it was nearly a miracle thatonly one of them had been - and dragged along lifelessly.It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what itactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell ofsomething to eat.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
By the door there was a dish filled withsweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Hewas so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than hehad been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into themilk, nearly covering his eyes with it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
But he soon drew his headback again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tenderleft side make it difficult to eat the food - he was only able toeat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but themilk did not taste at all nice.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Milk like this was normally hisfavourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for himbecause of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, awayfrom the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas hadbeen lit in the living room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His father at this time would normallybe sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice toGregor's mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now nota sound to be heard.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor's sister would often write and tell himabout this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit inrecent times.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It was so quiet all around too, even though theremust have been somebody in the flat.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""What a quiet life it is thefamily lead"", said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness,felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that insuch a nice home for his sister and parents.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But what now, if allthis peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible andfrightening end?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"That was something that Gregor did not want tothink about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up anddown the room.Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room wasopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the dooron the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed toenter the room but thought better of it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor went and waitedimmediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorousvisitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who itwas; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited invain.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone hadwanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened upone of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some timeduring the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living roomwas put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister hadstayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard asthey went away together on tip-toe.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
It was clear that no-one wouldcome into Gregor's room any more until morning; that gave him plentyof time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrangehis life.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forcedto remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor,even though he had been living in it for five years.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Hardly awareof what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, hehurried under the couch.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It pressed down on his back a little, andhe was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless feltimmediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was toobroad to get it all underneath.He spent the whole night there.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Some of the time he passed in alight sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because ofhis hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vaguehopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for thetime being he must remain calm, he must show patience and thegreatest consideration so that his family could bear theunpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced toimpose on them.Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of hisdecisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night hadended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from thefront room and looked anxiously in.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She did not see him straightaway, but when she did notice him under the couch - he had to besomewhere, for God's sake, he couldn't have flown away - she was soshocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shutagain from outside.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as sheopened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as ifentering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch,and watched her.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Would she notice that he had left the milk as itwas, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring himin some other food that was more suitable?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"If she didn't do itherself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under thecouch, throw himself at his sister's feet and beg her for somethinggood to eat.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"However, his sister noticed the full dish immediatelyand looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it withsome surprise.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She immediately picked it up - using a rag,not her bare hands - and carried it out.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor was extremelycurious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining thewildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what hissister, in her goodness, actually did bring.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"In order to test histaste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread outon an old newspaper.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bonesfrom the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; afew raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declaredinedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread withbutter and salt.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"As well as all that she had poured some water intothe dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor'suse, and placed it beside them.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Then, out of consideration forGregor's feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front ofher, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock sothat Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable forhimself as he liked.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor's little legs whirred, at last he couldeat.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"What's more, his injuries must already have completely healedas he found no difficulty in moving.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"This amazed him, as more thana month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, hethought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", he thought, and wasalready sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almostcompellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on thenewspaper.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Quickly one after another, his eyes watering withpleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; thefresh foods, on the other hand, he didn't like at all, and evendragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from thembecause he couldn't stand the smell.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Long after he had finishedeating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turnedthe key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Hewas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and hehurried back under the couch.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But he needed great self-control tostay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room,as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and hecould hardly breathe in that narrow space.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Half suffocating, hewatched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took abroom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food hehad not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more.She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its woodenlid, and carried everything out.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She had hardly turned her backbefore Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretchedhimself.This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in themorning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and thesecond time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as hisparents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor'ssister would send the maid away on some errand.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor's father andmother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps itwould have been more than they could stand to have any moreexperience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps hissister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they wereindeed suffering enough.It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told thedoctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of theflat.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister,thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content tohear his sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved abouthis room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It was only later, when she had become a little more usedto everything - there was, of course, no question of her everbecoming fully used to the situation - that Gregor would sometimescatch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could beconstrued as friendly.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""He's enjoyed his dinner today"", she mightsay when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him,or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and morefrequent, she would often say, sadly, ""now everything's just beenleft there again"".Although Gregor wasn't able to hear any news directly he did listento much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heardanyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door andpress his whole body against it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"There was seldom any conversation,especially at first, that was not about him in some way, even ifonly in secret.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtimewas about what they should do now; but even between meals they spokeabout the same subject as there were always at least two members ofthe family at home - nobody wanted to be at home by themselves andit was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
And onthe very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and beggedGregor's mother to let her go without delay.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It was not very clearhow much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarterof an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor's mother for her dismissal asif she had done her an enormous service.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She even sworeemphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what hadhappened, even though no-one had asked that of her.Now Gregor's sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much.Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge anotherto eat, and receive no more answer than ""no thanks, I've had enough""or something similar.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
No-one drank very much either.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His sisterwould sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hopingfor the chance to go and fetch it herself.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"When his father thensaid nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, thatshe could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father wouldclose the matter with a big, loud ""No"", and no more would be said.Even before the first day had come to an end, his father hadexplained to Gregor's mother and sister what their finances andprospects were.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Now and then he stood up from the table and tooksome receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved fromhis business when it had collapsed five years earlier.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Gregor heardhow he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after hehad taken the item he wanted.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
What he heard his father say was someof the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first beenincarcerated in his room.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He had thought that nothing at allremained from his father's business, at least he had never told himanything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway.Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of totaldespair, and Gregor's only concern at that time had been to arrangethings so that they could all forget about it as quickly aspossible.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"So then he started working especially hard, with a fieryvigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travellingrepresentative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earnmoney in quite different ways.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Gregor converted his success at workstraight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for thebenefit of his astonished and delighted family.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"They had been goodtimes and they had never come again, at least not with the samesplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he wasin a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bearthem.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family,they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it,although there was no longer much warm affection given in return.Gregor only remained close to his sister now.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Unlike him, she wasvery fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was hissecret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though itwould cause great expense that would have to be made up for in someother way.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"During Gregor's short periods in town, conversation withhis sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only evermentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Theirparents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thoughtabout it quite hard and decided he would let them know what heplanned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through hismind in his present state, pressed upright against the door andlistening.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"There were times when he simply became too tired tocontinue listening, when his head would fall wearily against thedoor and he would pull it up again with a start, as even theslightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they wouldall go silent.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""What's that he's doing now"", his father would sayafter a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only thenwould the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied withthese matters himself and partly because Gregor's mother did notunderstand everything the first time.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"From these repeated explanationsGregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunesthere was still some money available from the old days.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It was nota lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interesthad accumulated.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Besides that, they had not been using up all themoney that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only alittle for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating.Behind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure atthis unexpected thrift and caution.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He could actually have usedthis surplus money to reduce his father's debt to his boss, and theday when he could have freed himself from that job would have comemuch closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father haddone things.This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the familyto live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for,perhaps, one or two years, no more.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"That's to say, it was moneythat should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies;money to live on had to be earned.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His father was healthy but old,and lacking in self confidence.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
During the five years that he hadnot been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full ofstrain and no success - he had put on a lot of weight and becomevery slow and clumsy.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Would Gregor's elderly mother now have to goand earn money?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for herjust to move about the home, every other day would be spentstruggling for breath on the sofa by the open window.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Would hissister have to go and earn money?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She was still a child ofseventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consistingof wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business,joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing theviolin.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money,Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himselfonto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot withshame and regret.He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping awink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Or he might goto all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up ontothe sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window tostare out of it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He had used to feel a great sense of freedom fromdoing this, but doing it now was obviously something more rememberedthan experienced,  as what he actually saw in this way was becomingless distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he hadused to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across thestreet, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not knownthat he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despitebeing in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he waslooking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and thegrey earth mingled inseparably.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His observant sister only needed tonotice the chair twice before she would always push it back to itsexact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, andeven left the inner pane of the window open from then on.If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank herfor all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for himto bear it; but as it was it caused him pain.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His sister,naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothingburdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, thebetter she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was alsoable to see through it all so much better.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It had even become veryunpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"No soonerhad she come in than she would quickly close the door as aprecaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view intoGregor's room, then she would go straight to the window and pull ithurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Even if it wascold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a littlewhile.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running aboutand noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the wholewhile, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked tospare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in thesame room with him with the windows closed.One day, about a month after Gregor's transformation when his sisterno longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance,she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found himstill staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would bemost horrible.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"In itself, his sister's not coming into the roomwould have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have beendifficult for her to immediately open the window while he was stillthere, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back andclosed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he hadthreatened her and tried to bite her.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor went straight to hidehimself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until middaybefore his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy thanusual.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It made him realise that she still found his appearanceunbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had toovercome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him thatprotruded from under the couch.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"One day, in order to spare her eventhis sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to thecouch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely coveredand his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down.If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to dowas take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was nopleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
She left thesheet where it was.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look ofgratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheetto see how his sister liked the new arrangement.For the first fourteen days, Gregor's parents could not bringthemselves to come into the room to see him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He would often hearthem say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doingeven though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhatuseless and frequently been annoyed with her.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But now the two ofthem, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door ofGregor's room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon asshe went out again she would have to tell them exactly howeverything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved thistime and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen.His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon buthis father and sister at first persuaded her against it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregorlistened very closely to all this, and approved fully.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Later,though, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out:""Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Can't youunderstand I have to see him?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", and Gregor would think to himselfthat maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every dayof course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understandeverything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, wasstill just a child after all, and really might not have had anadult's appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.Gregor's wish to see his mother was soon realised.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Out ofconsideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen atthe window during the day, the few square meters of the floor didnot give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just liequietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him anypleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habitof crawling up and down the walls and ceiling.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He was especiallyfond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lyingon the floor; he could breathe more freely; his body had a lightswing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happenthat he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling andlanding on the floor with a crash.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But now, of course, he had farbetter control of his body than before and, even with a fall asgreat as that, caused himself no damage.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Very soon his sisternoticed Gregor's new way of entertaining himself - he had, afterall, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about -and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him byremoving the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest ofdrawers and the desk.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Now, this was not something that she would beable to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from herfather; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since thecook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, shehad even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all timesand never to have to open the door unless it was especiallyimportant; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time whenGregor's father was not there and fetch his mother to help her.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Asshe approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express herjoy, but once at the door she went silent.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"First, of course, hissister came in and looked round to see that everything in the roomwas alright; and only then did she let her mother enter.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Gregor hadhurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put morefolds into it so that everything really looked as if it had justbeen thrown down by chance.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor also refrained, this time, fromspying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see hismother until later and was simply glad that she had come.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""You cancome in, he can't be seen"", said his sister, obviously leading herin by the hand.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pairof feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as theypushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviestpart of the work for herself and ignoring her mother's warnings thatshe would strain herself.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
This lasted a very long time.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Afterlabouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it wouldbe better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was tooheavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor's father gothome and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his wayeven more, and for another thing it wasn't even sure that taking thefurniture away would really be any help to him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She thought justthe opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to herheart; and why wouldn't Gregor feel the same way about it, he'd beenused to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would makehim feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Then, quietly,almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she didnot know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she wasconvinced that he did not understand her words, she added ""and bytaking the furniture away, won't it seem like we're showing thatwe've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning him tocope for himself?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"I think it'd be best to leave the room exactly theway it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he'llfind everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time inbetween all the easier"".Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that thelack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonouslife led by the family during these two months, must have made himconfused - he could think of no other way of explaining to himselfwhy he had seriously wanted his room emptied out.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Had he reallywanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted outwith the nice furniture he had inherited?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"That would have let himcrawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have lethim quickly forget his past when he had still been human.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He hadcome very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of hismother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Nothingshould be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do withoutthe good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if thefurniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly thatwas not a loss but a great advantage.His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to theidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor's spokesman to hisparents about the things that concerned him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"This meant that hismother's advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist onremoving not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she hadthought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-importantcouch.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It was more than childish perversity, of course, or theunexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made herinsist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room tocrawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see,was of no use to him at all.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Girls of that age, though, do becomeenthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way wheneverthey can.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor'ssituation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could doeven more for him.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Grete would probably be the only one who woulddare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare wallsby himself.So she refused to let her mother dissuade her.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor's motheralready looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking andhelped Gregor's sister to get the chest of drawers out with whatstrength she had.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The chest of drawers was something that Gregorcould do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay.Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, outof the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch tosee what he could do about it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He meant to be as careful andconsiderate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother whocame back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round thechest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herselfwithout, of course, moving it an inch.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His mother was not used tothe sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurriedbackwards to the far end of the couch.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"In his startlement, though,he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving alittle.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
It was enough to attract his mother's attention.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She stoodvery still, remained there a moment, and then went back out toGrete.Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual washappening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved afterall, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, theirlittle calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on thefloor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailedfrom all sides.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"With his head and legs pulled in against him andhis body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himselfthat he could not stand all of this much longer.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"They were emptyinghis room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they hadalready taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools;now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its placeclearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homeworkas a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been atinfant school--he really could not wait any longer to see whetherthe two women's intentions were good.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He had nearly forgotten theywere there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything whilethey worked and he could only hear their feet as they steppedheavily on the floor.So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other roomcatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four timesnot knowing what he should save first before his attention wassuddenly caught by the picture on the wall - which was alreadydenuded of everything else that had been on it - of the lady dressedin copious fur.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himselfagainst its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hotbelly.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, wouldcertainly be taken away by no-one.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He turned his head to face thedoor into the living room so that he could watch the women when theycame back.They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quitesoon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearlycarrying her.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""What shall we take now, then?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", said Grete andlooked around.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Perhapsonly because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her faceto her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedlyand with a tremor in her voice: ""Come on, let's go back in theliving room for a while?""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor could see what Grete had in mind,she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him downfrom the wall.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Well, she could certainly try it!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He sat unyieldingon his picture.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He would rather jump at Grete's face.But Grete's words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped toone side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of thewallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she sawscreamed: ""Oh God, oh God!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Arms outstretched, she fell onto thecouch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile.""Gregor!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since histransformation.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She ran into the other room to fetch some kind ofsmelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wantedto help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuckfast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he,too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like inthe old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; shewas looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turnedround; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cutGregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him;now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottlesshe could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the doorshut with her foot.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"So now Gregor was shut out from his mother,who, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open thedoor if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had tostay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and,oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finallyin his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he felldown into the middle of the dinner table.He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it wasquiet, maybe that was a good sign.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Then there was someone at thedoor.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen sothat Grete would have to go and answer it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
His father had arrivedhome.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""What's happened?""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
were his first words; Grete's appearancemust have made everything clear to him.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She answered him withsubdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: ""Mother'sfainted, but she's better now.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor got out.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Just as Iexpected"", said his father, ""just as I always said, but you womenwouldn't listen, would you.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It was clear to Gregor that Grete hadnot said enough and that his father took it to mean that somethingbad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence.That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as hedid not have the time to explain things to him even if that had beenpossible.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himselfagainst it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, couldsee straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would goback into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary todrive him back but that they had only to open the door and he woulddisappear.His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties likethat; ""Ah!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were bothangry and glad at the same time.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Gregor drew his head back from thedoor and lifted it towards his father.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He really had not imaginedhis father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habitof crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what wasgoing on the rest of the flat the way he had done before.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He reallyought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, wasthat really his father?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The same tired man as used to be layingthere entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his businesstrips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in hisnightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly evenable to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raisehis arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for awalk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly inhis overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour hisway forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walkingslowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and,if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather hiscompanions around him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He was standing up straight enough now;dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn bythe employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collarof the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushyeyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; hisnormally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to hisscalp.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, somebank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa,put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of hislong uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towardsGregor.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind,but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor was amazedat the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no timewith that - he knew full well, right from the first day of his newlife, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremelystrict with him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And so he ran up to his father, stopped when hisfather stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, evenslightly.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"In this way they went round the room several timeswithout anything decisive happening, without even giving theimpression of a chase as everything went so slowly.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor remainedall this time on the floor, largely because he feared his fathermight see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall orceiling.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainlywould not be able to keep up this running about for long, as foreach step his father took he had to carry out countless movements.He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life hislungs had not been very reliable.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Now, as he lurched about in hisefforts to muster all the strength he could for running he couldhardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him tothink of any other way of saving himself than running; he almostforgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, theywere concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches andprotrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flewdown and rolled in front of him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
It was an apple; then another oneimmediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longerany point in running as his father had decided to bombard him.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Hehad filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard andnow, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one appleafter another.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"These little, red apples rolled about on the floor,knocking into each other as if they had electric motors.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
An applethrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid offwithout doing any harm.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Another one however, immediately followingit, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to draghimself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incrediblepain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spotand spread himself out, all his senses in confusion.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The last thinghe saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister wasscreaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as hissister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted tomake it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, herskirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground,stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her armsaround him, uniting herself with him totally - now Gregor lost hisability to see anything - her hands behind his father's head begginghim to spare Gregor's life.IIINo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor's flesh, so itremained there as a visible reminder of his injury.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He had sufferedit there for more than a month, and his condition seemed seriousenough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his currentsad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treatedas an enemy.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"On the contrary, as a family there was a duty toswallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility -probably permanently.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He had been reduced to the condition of anancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl acrosshis room - crawling over the ceiling was out of the question - butthis deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) madeup for by the door to the living room being left open every evening.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hoursbefore it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his roomwhere he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch thefamily in the light of the dinner table and listen to theirconversation - with everyone's permission, in a way, and thus quitedifferently from before.They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, ofcourse, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing whenhe was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
All of them were usually very quiet nowadays.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Soon after dinner,his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sisterwould urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under thelamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, whohad taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the eveningsso that she might be able to get a better position later on.Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother""you're doing so much sewing again today!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", as if he did not knowthat he had been dozing - and then he would go back to sleep againwhile mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor's father refused to take hisuniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its pegGregor's father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as ifalways ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of hissuperior even here.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The uniform had not been new to start with, butas a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite theefforts of Gregor's mother and sister to look after it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregorwould often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains onthis coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny,while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable butpeaceful.As soon as it struck ten, Gregor's mother would speak gently to hisfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as hecouldn't sleep properly where he was and he really had to get hissleep if he was to be up at six to get to work.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But since he hadbeen in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist onstaying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleepand it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange thechair for his bed.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Then, however much mother and sister wouldimportune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keepslowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyesclosed and refusing to get up.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor's mother would tug at hissleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor's sister wouldleave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effecton him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He would just sink deeper into his chair.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Only when thetwo women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes,look at them one after the other and say: ""What a life!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"This is whatpeace I get in my old age!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And supported by the two women he wouldlift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest loadhimself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carryon by himself while Gregor's mother would throw down her needle andhis sister her pen so that they could run after his father andcontinue being of help to him.Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time togive more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Thehousehold budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed;an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flappedaround her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviestwork; everything else was looked after by Gregor's mother on top ofthe large amount of sewing work she did.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor even learned,listening to the evening conversation about what price they hadhoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the familyhad been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fondof wearing them at functions and celebrations.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But the loudestcomplaint was that although the flat was much too big for theirpresent circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was noimaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He couldsee quite well, though, that there were more reasons thanconsideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, itwould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable cratewith a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family backfrom their decision to move was much more to do with their totaldespair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortuneunlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were relatedto.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"They carried out absolutely everything that the world expectsfrom poor people, Gregor's father brought bank employees theirbreakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes forstrangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at thebehest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength todo any more.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
And the injury in Gregor's back began to hurt as muchas when it was new.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"After they had come back from taking his fatherto bed Gregor's mother and sister would now leave their work whereit was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother wouldpoint to Gregor's room and say ""Close that door, Grete"", and then,when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room andtheir tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staringdry-eyed at the table.Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Sometimes he wouldthink of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, thenext time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his bossand the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts,the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or threefriends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from aprovincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappearedagain, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had beenserious but too slow, - all of them appeared to him, mixed togetherwith strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helpinghim and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he wasglad when they disappeared.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Other times he was not at all in themood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage aboutthe lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think ofnothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get intothe pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to,even if he was not hungry.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor's sister no longer thought abouthow she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or otherinto his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in themorning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it awayagain with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or- more often than not - had been left totally untouched.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She stillcleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have beenany quicker about it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Smears of dirt were left on the walls, hereand there were little balls of dust and filth.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"At first, Gregorwent into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrivedas a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weekswithout his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirtas well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it.At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new forher and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning upGregor's room was for her and her alone.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor's mother did oncethoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls ofwater to do it - although that much dampness also made Gregor illand he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But his motherwas to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly hadhis sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the changein Gregor's room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the livingroom where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, shebroke into convulsive tears.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Her father, of course, was startledout of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished andhelpless; then they, too, became agitated; Gregor's father, standingto the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaningof Gregor's room to his sister; from her left, Gregor's sisterscreamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor's room again;while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himselfwith anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears,thumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed inanger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save himthe sight of this and all its noise.Gregor's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and lookingafter Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, buteven so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place.Gregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Now, though,the charwoman was here.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"This elderly widow, with a robust bonestructure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things inher long life, wasn't really repelled by Gregor.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Just by chance oneday, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor'sroom and found herself face to face with him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He was taken totallyby surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and frowhile she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed infront of her.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
From then on she never failed to open the doorslightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Atfirst she would call to him as she did so with words that sheprobably considered friendly, such as ""come on then, you olddung-beetle!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", or ""look at the old dung-beetle there!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor neverresponded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where hewas without moving as if the door had never even been opened.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Ifonly they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every dayinstead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she feltlike it!,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck thewindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began tospeak to him in that way once again.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor was so resentful of itthat he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but itwas like a kind of attack.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Instead of being afraid, the charwomanjust lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood therewith her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth untilthe chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor's back.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Aren't you coming any closer, then?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", she asked when Gregor turnedround again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Only if he happened tofind himself next to the food that had been prepared for him hemight take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it therea few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Atfirst he thought it was distress at the state of his room thatstopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes madethere.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"They had got into the habit of putting things into this roomthat they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now manysuch things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out tothree gentlemen.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"These earnest gentlemen - all three of them hadfull beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the doorone day - were painfully insistent on things' being tidy.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Thismeant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room inthis establishment, in the entire flat and especially in thekitchen.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate,especially if it was dirty.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
They had moreover brought most of theirown furnishings and equipment with them.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"For this reason, manythings had become superfluous which, although they could not besold, the family did not wish to discard.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
All these things foundtheir way into Gregor's room.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
The dustbins from the kitchen foundtheir way in there too.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The charwoman was always in a hurry, andanything she couldn't use for the time being she would just chuck inthere.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the objectand the hand that held it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The woman most likely meant to fetch thethings back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or tothrow everything out in one go, but what actually happened was thatthey were left where they landed when they had first been thrownunless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhereelse.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"At first he moved it because, with no other room free wherehe could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came toenjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired todeath, and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their eveningmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and sothe door to this room was often kept closed in the evening.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"ButGregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, afterall, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, withoutthe family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkestcorner.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the livingroom slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen whorented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on.They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his mealswith his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and pickedup their knives and forks.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Gregor's mother immediately appeared inthe doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sisterwith a dish piled high with potatoes.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The food was steaming, andfilled the room with its smell.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The gentlemen bent over the dishesset in front of them as if they wanted to test the food beforeeating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count asan authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meatwhile it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whetherit was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to thekitchen.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor's mother andsister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe againand smiled.The family themselves ate in the kitchen.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Nonetheless, Gregor'sfather came into the living room before he went into the kitchen,bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table.The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Itseemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises ofeating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they hadwanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it wasnot possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothlesshowever nice they might be.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""I'd like to eat something"", saidGregor anxiously, ""but not anything like they're eating.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
They dofeed themselves.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And here I am, dying!",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard theviolin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from thekitchen.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, theone in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each ofthe others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them andsmoking.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"When the violin began playing they became attentive, stoodup and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where theystood pressed against each other.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Someone must have heard them inthe kitchen, as Gregor's father called out: ""Is the playing perhapsunpleasant for the gentlemen?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"We can stop it straight away.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Onthe contrary"", said the middle gentleman, ""would the young lady notlike to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, afterall, much more cosy and comfortable?""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Oh yes, we'd love to"",called back Gregor's father as if he had been the violin playerhimself.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.Gregor's father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother withthe music and his sister with the violin.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She calmly preparedeverything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had neverrented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggeratedcourtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit ontheir own chairs; his father leant against the door with his righthand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother,though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leavingthe chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it - out ofthe way in a corner.His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention,one on each side, to the movements of her hands.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Drawn in by theplaying, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already hadhis head in the living room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Before, he had taken great pride inhow considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he hadbecome so thoughtless about the others.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"What's more, there was nowall the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in thedust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightestmovement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about onhis back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now tolay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used todo several times a day.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And despite this condition, he was not tooshy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the livingroom.No-one noticed him, though.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The family was totally preoccupied withthe violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put theirhands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the musicstand to look at all the notes being played, and they must havedisturbed Gregor's sister, but soon, in contrast with the family,they  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talkingto each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window whileGregor's father observed them anxiously.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It really now seemed veryobvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful orentertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they hadhad enough of the whole performance and it was only now out ofpoliteness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It wasespecially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from theircigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Yet Gregor's sisterwas playing so beautifully.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Her face was leant to one side,following the lines of music with a careful and melancholyexpression.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping hishead close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if thechance came.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Was he an animal if music could captivate him so?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Itseemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknownnourishment he had been yearning for.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He was determined to make hisway forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she mightcome into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated herplaying here as much as he would.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He never wanted to let her out ofhis room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearanceshould, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at everydoor of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; hissister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay ofher own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with herear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended tosend her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone aboutit last Christmas - had Christmas really come and gone already?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"- ifthis misfortune hadn't got in the way, and refuse to let anyonedissuade him from it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"On hearing all this, his sister would breakout in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulderand kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, shehad kept free without any necklace or collar.""Mr.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Samsa!,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor's father,pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger atGregor as he slowly moved forward.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The violin went silent, themiddle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends,shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His father seemedto think it more important to calm the three gentlemen beforedriving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset andseemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playinghad been.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He rushed up to them with his arms spread out andattempted to drive them back into their room at the same time astrying to block their view of Gregor with his body.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Now they didbecome a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was hisfather's behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation thatthey had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room withoutknowing it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"They asked Gregor's father for explanations, raisedtheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and movedback towards their room only very slowly.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Meanwhile Gregor's sisterhad overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing wassuddenly interrupted.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She had let her hands drop and let violin andbow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as ifstill playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, laythe instrument on her mother's lap who still sat laboriouslystruggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next roomwhich, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were morequickly moving toward.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Under his sister's experienced hand, thepillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order andshe had already finished making the beds and slipped out againbefore the three gentlemen had reached the room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Gregor's fatherseemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all therespect he owed to his tenants.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He urged them and pressed themuntil, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle ofthe three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot andthereby brought Gregor's father to a halt.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""I declare here andnow"", he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor's mother andsister to gain their attention too, ""that with regard to therepugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family""- here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor - ""I giveimmediate notice on my room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"For the days that I have been livinghere I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I willconsider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damagesfrom you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out thegrounds for such an action.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He was silent and looked straightahead as if waiting for something.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And indeed, his two friendsjoined in with the words: ""And we also give immediate notice.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Withthat, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.Gregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with hishands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himselfout for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his headkept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all.Throughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemenhad first seen him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His disappointment at the failure of his plan,and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossiblefor him to move.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He was sure that everyone would turn on him anymoment, and he waited.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He was not even startled out of this statewhen the violin on his mother's lap fell from her trembling fingersand landed loudly on the floor.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Father, Mother"", said his sister, hitting the table with her handas introduction, ""we can't carry on like this.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Maybe you can't seeit, but I can.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"I don't want to call this monster my brother, all Ican say is: we have to try and get rid of it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"We've done all that'shumanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don't thinkanyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""""She's absolutely right"", said Gregor's father to himself.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Hismother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began tocough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a derangedexpression in her eyes.Gregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on herforehead.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some moredefinite ideas.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He sat upright, played with his uniform cap betweenthe plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, andoccasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""We have to try and get rid of it"", said Gregor's sister, nowspeaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied withcoughing to listen, ""it'll be the death of both of you, I can see itcoming.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"We can't all work as hard as we have to and then come hometo be tortured like this, we can't endure it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"I can't endure it anymore.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed downthe face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical handmovements.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""My child"", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,""what are we to do?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessnessand tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earliercertainty.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""If he could just understand us"", said his father almost as aquestion; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears asa sign that of that there was no question.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""If he could just understand us"", repeated Gregor's father, closinghis eyes in acceptance of his sister's certainty that that was quiteimpossible, ""then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangementwith him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But as it is ...""""It's got to go"", shouted his sister, ""that's the only way, Father.You've got to get rid of the idea that that's Gregor.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
We've onlyharmed ourselves by believing it for so long.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
How can that beGregor?,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it's notpossible for human beings to live with an animal like that and hewould have gone of his own free will.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"We wouldn't have a brotherany more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and rememberhim with respect.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"As it is this animal is persecuting us, it'sdriven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the wholeflat and force us to sleep on the streets.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Father, look, justlook"", she suddenly screamed, ""he's starting again!""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"In her alarm,which was totally beyond Gregor's comprehension, his sister evenabandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of herchair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stayanywhere near Gregor.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She rushed over to behind her father, who hadbecome excited merely because she was and stood up half raising hishands in front of Gregor's sister as if to protect her.But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of allhis sister.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"All he had done was begin to turn round so that hecould go back into his room, although that was in itself quitestartling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning roundrequired a great deal of effort and he was using his head to helphimself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against thefloor.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He stopped and looked round.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
They seemed to have realisedhis good intention and had only been alarmed briefly.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Now they alllooked at him in unhappy silence.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"His mother lay in her chair withher legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyesnearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his fatherwith her arms around his neck.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Maybe now they'll let me turn round"", thought Gregor and went backto work.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He could not help panting loudly with the effort and hadsometimes to stop and take a rest.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"No-one was making him rush anymore, everything was left up to him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
As soon as he had finallyfinished turning round he began to move straight ahead.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He wasamazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, andcould not understand how he had covered that distance in his weakstate a little while before and almost without noticing it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Heconcentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed thatthere was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him.He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He didnot turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff,but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him hadchanged, only his sister had stood up.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"With his last glance he sawthat his mother had now fallen completely asleep.He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,bolted and locked.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled himthat his little legs collapsed under him.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
It was his sister who hadbeen in so much of a rush.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She had been standing there waiting andsprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, andas she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents ""Atlast!"".",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""What now, then?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in thedarkness.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He soon made the discovery that he could no longer moveat all.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that beingable to actually move around on those spindly little legs until thenwas unnatural.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He also felt relatively comfortable.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"It is truethat his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowlygetting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or theinflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust.He thought back of his family with emotion and love.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"If it waspossible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than hissister.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
He remained in this state of empty and peaceful ruminationuntil he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Hewatched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside thewindow too.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Then, without his willing it, his head sank downcompletely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.When the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often askedher not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in herhurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'darrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - shemade her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothingspecial.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She thought he was laying there so still on purpose,playing the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding tohim.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so shetried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"When she had nosuccess with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and pokedat him a little, and only when she found she could shove him acrossthe floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention.She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide,whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroomdoors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: ""Come and'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!""Mr.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
and  Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and hadto make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner beforethey could grasp what she was saying.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"But then, each from his ownside, they hurried out of bed.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over hisshoulders,  Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that ishow they went into Gregor's room.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"On the way they opened the doorto the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the threegentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had neverbeen asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this.""Dead?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", asked  Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly,even though she could have checked for herself and could have knownit even without checking.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""That's what I said"",  replied thecleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove withthe broom, sending it sideways across the floor.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Mrs. Samsa made amovement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did notcomplete it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Now then"", said  Mr. Samsa, ""let's give thanks to Godfor that"".",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He crossed himself, and the three women followed hisexample.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said:""Just look how thin he was.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"He didn't eat anything for so long.The food came out again just the same as when it went in"".",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Gregor'sbody was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen ituntil then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor didhe do anything to make them look away.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Grete, come with us in here for a little while"", said  Mrs. Samsawith a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroombut not without looking back at the body.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
The cleaner shut the doorand opened the window wide.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Although it was still early in themorning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Itwas already the end of March, after all.The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round inamazement for their breakfasts;  they had been forgotten about.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Where is our breakfast?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", the middle gentleman asked the cleanerirritably.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick andsilent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor'sroom.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with theirhands in the pockets of their well-worn coats.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
It was now quitelight in the room.Then the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr. Samsa appeared in hisuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Allof them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed herface against her father's arm.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Leave my home.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Now!,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", said  Mr. Samsa, indicating the door andwithout letting the women from him.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""What do you mean?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", asked themiddle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiledsweetly.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
The other two held their hands behind their backs andcontinually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loudquarrel which could only end in their favour.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""I mean just what Isaid"", answered  Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in astraight line towards the man.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"At first, he stood there still,looking at the ground as if the contents of his head wererearranging themselves into new positions.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Alright, we'll gothen"", he said, and looked up at  Mr. Samsa as if he had beensuddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again fromMr.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Samsa for his decision.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wideand briefly nodded to him several times.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"At that, and withoutdelay, the man actually did take long strides into the fronthallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some timebefore and had been listening to what was being said.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Now theyjumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear thatMr.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break theconnection with their leader.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Once there, all three took their hatsfrom the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without aword and left the premises.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Mr. Samsa and the two women followedthem out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrustthe men's intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw howthe three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the manysteps.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared andwould reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, themore that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher'sboy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on hisway up and came nearer than they were,  Mr. Samsa and the women cameaway from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxationand to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work butthey were in serious need of it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"So they sat at the table and wrotethree letters of excusal,  Mr. Samsa to his employers,  Mrs. Samsato her contractor and Grete to her principal.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The cleaner came inwhile they were writing to tell them she was going, she'd finishedher work for that morning.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The three of them at first just noddedwithout looking up from what they were writing, and it was only whenthe cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked upin irritation.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Well?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", asked  Mr. Samsa.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The charwoman stood inthe doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendousgood news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly askedto.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, whichhad been a source of irritation to  Mr. Samsa all the time she hadbeen working for them, swayed gently in all directions.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""What is ityou want then?",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
""", asked  Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the mostrespect for.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Yes"", she answered, and broke into a friendly laughthat made her unable to speak straight away, ""well then, that thingin there, you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"That's all been sorted out.""",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down overtheir letters as if intent on continuing with what they werewriting;  Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describingeverything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quiteclear that she was not to.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"So, as she was prevented from tellingthem all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was inand, clearly peeved, called out ""Cheerio then, everyone"", turnedround sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"""Tonight she gets sacked"", said  Mr. Samsa, but he received no replyfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to havedestroyed the peace they had only just gained.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
They got up and wentover to the window where they remained with their arms around eachother.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and satthere watching for a while.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Then he called out: ""Come here, then.Let's forget about all that old stuff, shall we.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Come and give me abit of attention"".",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The two women immediately did as he said,hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and thenthey quickly finished their letters.After that, the three of them left the flat together, which wassomething they had not done for months, and took the tram out to theopen country outside the town.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"They had the tram, filled with warmsunshine, all to themselves.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"Leant back comfortably on their seats,they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examinationthey were not at all bad - until then they had never asked eachother about their work but all three had jobs which were very goodand held particularly good promise for the future.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"The greatestimprovement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quiteeasily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that wassmaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen byGregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, morepractical.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"All the time, Grete was becoming livelier.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
"With all theworry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but,while they were talking,  Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa were struck, almostsimultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter wasblossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.",Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
They becamequieter.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis
Just from each other's glance and almost without knowingit they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man forher.,Franz Kafka,Metamorphosis

"K. paid hardlyany attention to what they were saying, he did not place much value onwhat he may have still possessed or on who decided what happened tothem.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was much more important to him to get a clear understanding ofhis position, but he could not think clearly while these people werehere, the second policeman's belly - and they could only be policemen -looked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but when K. looked upand saw his dry, boney face it did not seem to fit with the body.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"There was a very slight risk that people would later sayhe couldn't understand a joke, but - although he wasn't normally in thehabit of learning from experience - he might also have had a fewunimportant occasions in mind when, unlike his more cautious friends, hehad acted with no thought at all for what might follow and had been madeto suffer for it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"Once downstairs, K., withhis watch in his hand, decided to take a taxi - he had already beendelayed by half an hour and there was no need to make the delay anylonger.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Kaminer ran to the corner to summon it, and the two others weremaking obvious efforts to keep K. diverted when Kullich pointed to thedoorway of the house on the other side of the street where the large manwith the blonde goatee beard appeared and, a little embarrassed at firstat letting himself be seen in his full height, stepped back to the walland leant against it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The old couple were probably still on the stairs.K.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"was cross with Kullich for pointing out this man whom he had alreadyseen himself, in fact whom he had been expecting.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Don't look at him!",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""he snapped, without noticing how odd it was to speak to free men in thisway.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But there was no explanation needed anyway as just then the taxiarrived, they sat inside and set off.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Inside the taxi, K. rememberedthat he had not noticed the supervisor and the policemen leaving - thesupervisor had stopped him noticing the three bank staff and now thethree bank staff had stopped him noticing the supervisor.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This showedthat K. was not very attentive, and he resolved to watch himself morecarefully in this respect.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nonetheless, he gave it no thought as hetwisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car tocatch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But heturned back round straight away and leant comfortably into the corner ofthe taxi without even having made the effort to see anyone.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Although itdid not seem like it, now was just the time when he needed someencouragement, but the gentlemen seemed tired just then, Rabensteinerlooked out of the car to the right, Kullich to the left and only Kaminerwas there with his grin at K.'s service.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It would have been inhumane tomake fun of that.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That spring, whenever possible, K. usually spent his eveningsafter work - he usually stayed in the office until nine o'clock - with ashort walk, either by himself or in the company of some of the bankofficials, and then he would go into a pub where he would sit at theregulars' table with mostly older men until eleven.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There were,however, also exceptions to this habit, times, for instance, when K. wasinvited by the bank's manager (whom he greatly respected for hisindustry and trustworthiness) to go with him for a ride in his car or toeat dinner with him at his large house.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. would also go, once a week,to see a girl called Elsa who worked as a waitress in a wine bar throughthe night until late in the morning.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
During the daytime she onlyreceived visitors while still in bed.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That evening, though, - the day had passed quickly with a lot ofhard work and many respectful and friendly birthday greetings - K.wanted to go straight home.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Each time he had any small break from theday's work he considered, without knowing exactly what he had in mind,that Mrs. Grubach's flat seemed to have been put into great disarray bythe events of that morning, and that it was up to him to put it backinto order.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Once order had been restored, every trace of those eventswould have been erased and everything would take its previous courseonce more.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In particular, there was nothing to fear from the three bankofficials, they had immersed themselves back into their paperwork andthere was no alteration to be seen in them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. had called each of them,separately or all together, into his office that day for no other reasonthan to observe them; he was always satisfied and had always been ableto let them go again.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At half past nine that evening, when he arrived back in front ofthe building where he lived, he met a young lad in the doorway who wasstanding there, his legs apart and smoking a pipe.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Who are you?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""immediately asked K., bringing his face close to the lad's, as it washard to see in the half light of the landing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'm the landlord's son,sir,"" answered the lad, taking the pipe from his mouth and stepping toone side.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""The landlord's son?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K., and impatiently knocked onthe ground with his stick.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Did you want anything, sir?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Would you likeme to fetch my father?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No, no,"" said K., there was somethingforgiving in his voice, as if the boy had harmed him in some way and hewas excusing him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's alright,"" he said then, and went on, but beforegoing up the stairs he turned round once more.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He could have gone directly to his room, but as he wanted to speakwith Mrs. Grubach he went straight to her door and knocked.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
She was satat the table with a knitted stocking and a pile of old stockings infront of her.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. apologised, a little embarrassed at coming so late,but Mrs. Grubach was very friendly and did not want to hear any apology,she was always ready to speak to him, he knew very well that he was herbest and her favourite tenant.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. looked round the room, it lookedexactly as it usually did, the breakfast dishes, which had been on thetable by the window that morning, had already been cleared away.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Awoman's hands will do many things when no-one's looking,"" he thought, hemight himself have smashed all the dishes on the spot but certainlywould not have been able to carry it all out.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He looked at Mrs. Grubachwith some gratitude.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Why are you working so late?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
he asked.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Theywere now both sitting at the table, and K. now and then sank his handsinto the pile of stockings.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""There's a lot of work to do,"" she said,""during the day I belong to the tenants; if I'm to sort out my ownthings there are only the evenings left to me.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I fear I may havecaused you some exceptional work today.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""How do you mean, Mr.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K.?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"sheasked, becoming more interested and leaving her work in her lap.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Imean the men who were here this morning.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Oh, I see,"" she said, andwent peacefully back to what she was doing, ""that was no trouble, notespecially.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. looked on in silence as she took up the knittedstocking once more.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She seems surprised at my mentioning it, hethought, she seems to think it's improper for me to mention it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
All themore important for me to do so.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
An old woman is the only person I canspeak about it with.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""But it must have caused some work for you,"" hesaid then, ""but it won't happen again.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No, it can't happen again,"" sheagreed, and smiled at K. in a way that was almost pained.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Do you meanthat seriously?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K.  ""Yes,"" she said, more gently, ""but theimportant thing is you mustn't take it too hard.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
There are so manyawful things happening in the world!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As you're being so honest with me,Mr.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K., I can admit to you that I listened to a little of what was goingon from behind the door, and that those two policemen told me one or twothings as well.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It's all to do with your happiness, and that'ssomething that's quite close to my heart, perhaps more than it should beas I am, after all, only your landlady.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Anyway, so I heard one or twothings but I can't really say that it's about anything very serious.No.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You have been arrested, but it's not in the same way as when theyarrest a thief.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If you're arrested in the same way as a thief, thenit's bad, but an arrest like this ... .",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It seems to me that it'ssomething very complicated - forgive me if I'm saying something stupid -something very complicated that I don't understand, but something thatyou don't really need to understand anyway.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""There's nothing stupid about what you've said, Mrs. Grubach, orat least I partly agree with you, only, the way I judge the whole thingis harsher than yours, and think it's not only not something complicatedbut simply a fuss about nothing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I was just caught unawares, that'swhat happened.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If I had got up as soon as I was awake without lettingmyself get confused because Anna wasn't there, if I'd got up and paid noregard to anyone who might have been in my way and come straight to you,if I'd done something like having my breakfast in the kitchen as anexception, asked you to bring my clothes from my room, in short, if Ihad behaved sensibly then nothing more would have happened, everythingthat was waiting to happen would have been stifled.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
People are so oftenunprepared.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In the bank, for example, I am well prepared, nothing ofthis sort could possibly happen to me there, I have my own assistantthere, there are telephones for internal and external calls in front ofme on the desk, I continually receive visits from people,representatives, officials, but besides that, and most importantly, I'malways occupied with my work, that's to say I'm always alert, it wouldeven be a pleasure for me to find myself faced with something of thatsort.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But now it's over with, and I didn't really even want to talkabout it any more, only I wanted to hear what you, as a sensible woman,thought about it all, and I'm very glad to hear that we're in agreement.But now you must give me your hand, an agreement of this sort needs tobe confirmed with a handshake.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Will she shake hands with me?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The supervisor didn't shake hands,he thought, and looked at the woman differently from before, examiningher.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She stood up, as he had also stood up, and was a little self-conscious, she hadn't been able to understand everything that K.said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
As a result of this self consciousness she said something thatshe certainly did not intend and certainly was not appropriate.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Don'ttake it so hard, Mr. K.,"" she said, with tears in her voice and also, ofcourse, forgetting the handshake.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I didn't know I was taking it hard,""said K., feeling suddenly tired and seeing that if this woman did agreewith him it was of very little value.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Before going out the door he asked, ""Is Miss BÃ¼rstner home?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""No,"" said Mrs. Grubach, smiling as she gave this simple piece ofinformation, saying something sensible at last.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""She's at the theatre.Did you want to see her?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Should I give her a message?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I, er, I justwanted to have a few words with her.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"""Thank you, I'll take your word for it,"" said K, butwent nonetheless over to the open door.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The moon shone quietly into theunlit room.,Franz Kafka,The Trial

"Grubach, ""you're so right, Mr. K.  Perhaps it is in this case.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Icertainly wouldn't want to say anything nasty about Miss BÃ¼rstner, sheis a good, sweet girl, friendly, tidy, punctual, works hard, Iappreciate all that very much, but one thing is true, she ought to havemore pride, be a bit less forthcoming.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Twice this month already, in thestreet over the way, I've seen her with a different gentleman.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I reallydon't like saying this, you're the only one I've said this to, Mr. K., Iswear to God, but I'm going to have no choice but to have a few wordswith Miss BÃ¼rstner about it myself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"Good night.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Mr. K.,"" said Mrs. Grubach as if asking himfor something and hurrying to his door which he had already opened, ""Idon't want to speak to Miss BÃ¼rstner at all, not yet, of course I'llcontinue to keep an eye on her but you're the only one I've told what Iknow.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"Then heslammed the door shut, there was a gentle knocking to which he paid nomore attention.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He did not feel at all like going to bed, so he decided to stayup, and this would also give him the chance to find out when MissBÃ¼rstner would arrive home.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Perhaps it would also still be possible,even if a little inappropriate, to have a few words with her.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As he laythere by the window, pressing his hands to his tired eyes, he eventhought for a moment that he might punish Mrs. Grubach by persuadingMiss BÃ¼rstner to give in her notice at the same time as he would.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Buthe immediately realised that that would be shockingly excessive, andthere would even be the suspicion that he was moving house because ofthe incidents of that morning.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nothing would have been more nonsensicaland, above all, more pointless and contemptible.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
When he had become tired of looking out onto the empty street heslightly opened the door to the living room so that he could see anyonewho entered the flat from where he was and lay down on the couch.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Helay there, quietly smoking a cigar, until about eleven o'clock.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"Hehad no particular desire for her, he could not even remember what shelooked like, but now he wanted to speak to her and it irritated him thather late arrival home meant this day would be full of unease anddisorder right to its very end.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was also her fault that he had nothad any dinner that evening and that he had been unable to visit Elsa ashe had intended.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He could still make up for both of those things,though, if he went to the wine bar where Elsa worked.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He wanted to doso even later, after the discussion with Miss BÃ¼rstner.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"The next moment shewould certainly go into her room, where K. ought not to intrude in themiddle of the night; that meant he would have to speak to her now, but,unfortunately, he had not put the electric light on in his room so thatwhen he stepped out of the dark it would give the impression of being anattack and would certainly, at the very least, have been quite alarming.There was no time to lose, and in his helplessness he whispered throughthe crack of the door, ""Miss BÃ¼rstner.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial

You will have no needto consider me in any way.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If you wish to let it be known that I haveattacked you then Mrs. Grubach will be informed of such and she willbelieve it without even losing her trust in me, that's how much respectshe has for me.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"Hethought she would look up at him, but without changing her manner shesaid, ""Forgive me, but it was the suddenness of the knocking thatstartled me so much, not so much what the consequences of the captainbeing here might be.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was all so quiet after you'd shouted, and thenthere was the knocking, that's was made me so shocked, and I was sittingright by the door, the knocking was right next to me.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

he said.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She pulled her hand away and answered, ""No, no,I'm never cross with anyone.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He grasped her wrist once more, shetolerated it now and, in that way, lead him to the door.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He had fullyintended to leave.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But when he reached the door he came to a halt as ifhe hadn't expected to find a door there, Miss BÃ¼rstner made use of thatmoment to get herself free, open the door, slip out into the hallway andgently say to K. from there, ""Now, come along, please.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Look,"" shepointed to the captain's door, from under which there was a lightshining, ""he's put a light on and he's laughing at us.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Alright, I'mcoming,"" said K., moved forward, took hold of her, kissed her on themouth and then over her whole face like a thirsty animal lapping withits tongue when it eventually finds water.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He finally kissed her on herneck and her throat and left his lips pressed there for a long time.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Hedid not look up until there was a noise from the captain's room.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'llgo now,"" he said, he wanted to address Miss BÃ¼rstner by her Christianname, but did not know it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She gave him a tired nod, offered him herhand to kiss as she turned away as if she did not know what she wasdoing, and went back into her room with her head bowed.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"A short whilelater, K. was lying in his bed.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He very soon went to sleep, but beforehe did he thought a little while about his behaviour, he was satisfiedwith it but felt some surprise that he was not more satisfied; he wasseriously worried about Miss BÃ¼rstner because of the captain.Chapter TwoFirst Cross-examination        K. was informed by telephone that there would be a small hearingconcerning his case the following Sunday.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He was made aware that thesecross examinations would follow one another regularly, perhaps not everyweek but quite frequently.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the one hand it was in everyone's interestto bring proceedings quickly to their conclusion, but on the other handevery aspect of the examinations had to be carried out thoroughlywithout lasting too long because of the associated stress.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"For thesereasons, it had been decided to hold a series of brief examinationsfollowing on one after another.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Sunday had been chosen as the day forthe hearings so that K. would not be disturbed in his professional work.It was assumed that he would be in agreement with this, but if he wishedfor another date then, as far as possible, he would be accommodated.Cross-examinations could even be held in the night, for instance, but K.would probably not be fresh enough at that time.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Anyway, as long as K.made no objection, the hearing would be left on Sundays.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was amatter of course that he would have to appear without fail, there wasprobably no need to point this out to him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He would be given the numberof the building where he was to present himself, which was in a streetin a suburb well away from the city centre which K. had never been tobefore.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Once he had received this notice, K. hung up the receiver withoutgiving an answer; he had decided immediately to go there that Sunday, itwas certainly necessary, proceedings had begun and he had to face up toit, and this first examination would probably also be the last.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He wasstill standing in thought by the telephone when he heard the voice ofthe deputy director behind him - he wanted to use the telephone but K.stood in his way.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Bad news?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked the deputy director casually, notin order to find anything out but just to get K. away from the device.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No, no,"" said K., he stepped to one side but did not go away entirely.The deputy director picked up the receiver and, as he waited for hisconnection, turned away from it and said to K.,  ""One question, Mr. K.:Would you like to give me the pleasure of joining me on my sailing boaton Sunday morning?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There's quite a few people coming, you're bound toknow some of them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"One of them is Hasterer, the state attorney.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Wouldyou like to come along?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Do come along!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. tried to pay attention towhat the deputy director was saying.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was of no small importance forhim, as this invitation from the deputy director, with whom he had nevergot on very well, meant that he was trying to improve his relations withhim.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It showed how important K. had become in the bank and how itssecond most important official seemed to value his friendship, or atleast his impartiality.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He was only speaking at the side of thetelephone receiver while he waited for his connection, but in givingthis invitation the deputy director was humbling himself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But K. wouldhave to humiliate him a second time as a result, he said, ""Thank youvery much, but I'm afraid I will have no time on Sunday, I have aprevious obligation.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Pity,"" said the deputy director, and turned tothe telephone conversation that had just been connected.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was not ashort conversation, but K., remained standing confused by the instrumentall the time it was going on.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was only when the deputy director hungup that he was shocked into awareness and said, in order to partiallyexcuse his standing there for no reason, ""I've just received a telephonecall, there's somewhere I need to go, but they forgot to tell me whattime.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Ask them then,"" said the deputy director.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's not thatimportant,"" said K., although in that way his earlier excuse, alreadyweak enough, was made even weaker.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As he went, the deputy directorcontinued to speak about other things.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. forced himself to answer, buthis thoughts were mainly about that Sunday, how it would be best to getthere for nine o'clock in the morning as that was the time that courtsalways start work on weekdays.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The weather was dull on Sunday.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. was very tired, as he hadstayed out drinking until late in the night celebrating with some of theregulars, and he had almost overslept.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He dressed hurriedly, withoutthe time to think and assemble the various plans he had worked outduring the week.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"With no breakfast, he rushed to the suburb he had beentold about.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Oddly enough, although he had little time to look aroundhim, he came across the three bank officials involved in his case,Rabensteiner, Kullich and Kaminer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The first two were travelling in atram that went across K.'s route, but Kaminer sat on the terrace of acafÃ© and leant curiously over the wall as K. came over.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All of themseemed to be looking at him, surprised at seeing their superior running;it was  a kind of pride that made K. want to go on foot, this was hisaffair and the idea of any help from strangers, however slight, wasrepulsive to him, he also wanted to avoid asking for anyone's helpbecause that would initiate them into the affair even if only slightly.And after all, he had no wish at all to humiliate himself before thecommittee by being too punctual.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Anyway, now he was running so that hewould get there by nine o'clock if at all possible, even though he hadno appointment for this time.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had thought that he would recognise the building from adistance by some kind of sign, without knowing exactly what the signwould look like, or from some particular kind of activity outside theentrance.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. had been told that the building was in Juliusstrasse, butwhen he stood at the street's entrance it consisted on each side ofalmost nothing but monotonous, grey constructions, tall blocks of flatsoccupied by poor people.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now, on  a Sunday morning, most of the windowswere occupied, men in their shirtsleeves leant out smoking, or carefullyand gently held small children on the sills.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Other windows were piledup with bedding, above which the dishevelled head of a woman wouldbriefly appear.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"People called out to each other across the street, oneof the calls provoked a loud laugh about K. himself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was a longstreet, and spaced evenly along it were small shops below street level,selling various kinds of foodstuffs, which you reached by going down afew steps.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Women went in and out of them or stood chatting on thesteps.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"A fruitmonger, taking his goods up to the windows, was just asinattentive as K. and nearly knocked him down with his cart.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Just then,a gramophone, which in better parts of town would have been seen as wornout, began to play some murderous tune.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. went further into the street, slowly, as if he had plenty oftime now, or as if the examining magistrate were looking at him from oneof the windows and therefore knew that K. had found his way there.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Itwas shortly after nine.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The building was quite far down the street, itcovered so much area it was almost extraordinary, and the gateway inparticular was tall and long.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was clearly intended for deliverywagons belonging to the various warehouses all round the yard which werenow locked up and carried the names of companies some of which K. knewfrom his work at the bank.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In contrast with his usual habits, heremained standing a while at the entrance to the yard taking in allthese external details.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Near him, there was a bare-footed man sittingon a crate and reading a newspaper.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
There were two lads swinging on ahand cart.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In front of a pump stood a weak, young girl in a bedjacketwho, as the water flowed into her can, looked at K.  There was a pieceof rope stretched between two windows in a corner of the yard, with somewashing hanging on it to dry.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
A man stood below it calling outinstructions to direct the work being done.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. went over to the stairway to get to the room where the hearingwas to take place, but then stood still again as besides these steps hecould see three other stairway entrances, and there also seemed to be asmall passageway at the end of the yard leading into a second yard.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Itirritated him that he had not been given more precise directions to theroom, it meant they were either being especially neglectful with him orespecially indifferent, and he decided to make that clear to them veryloudly and very unambiguously.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In the end he decided to climb up thestairs, his thoughts playing on something that he remembered thepoliceman, Willem, saying to him; that the court is attracted by theguilt, from which it followed that the courtroom must be on the stairwaythat K. selected by chance.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
As he went up he disturbed a large group of children playing onthe stairs who looked at him as he stepped through their rows.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Nexttime I come here,"" he said to himself, ""I must either bring sweets withme to make them like me or a stick to hit them with.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Just before hereached the first landing he even had to wait a little while until aball had finished its movement, two small lads with sly faces likegrown-up scoundrels held him by his trouser-legs until it had; if hewere to shake them off he would have to hurt them, and he was afraid ofwhat noise they would make by shouting.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the first floor, his search began for real.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He still feltunable to ask for the investigating committee, and so he invented ajoiner called Lanz - that name occurred to him because the captain, Mrs.Grubach's nephew, was called Lanz - so that he could ask at every flatwhether Lanz the joiner lived there and thus obtain a chance to lookinto the rooms.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It turned out, though, that that was mostly possiblewithout further ado, as almost all the doors were left open and thechildren ran in and out.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Most of them were small, one-windowed roomswhere they also did the cooking.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Many women held babies in one arm andworked at the stove with the other.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Half grown girls, who seemed to bedressed in just their pinafores worked hardest running to and fro.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Inevery room, the beds were still in use by people who were ill, or stillasleep, or people stretched out on them in their clothes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. knocked atthe flats where the doors were closed and asked whether Lanz the joinerlived there.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was usually a woman who opened the door, heard theenquiry and turned to somebody in the room who would raise himself fromthe bed.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""The gentleman's asking if a joiner called Lanz, lives here.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""A joiner, called Lanz?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"he would ask from the bed.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That's right,"" K.would say, although it was clear that the investigating committee wasnot to be found there, and so his task was at an end.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There were manywho thought it must be very important for K. to find Lanz the joiner andthought long about it, naming a joiner who was not called Lanz or givinga name that had some vague similarity with Lanz, or they askedneighbours or accompanied K. to a door a long way away where theythought someone of that sort might live in the back part of the buildingor where someone would be who could advise K. better than they couldthemselves.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. eventually had to give up asking if he did not want tobe led all round from floor to floor in this way.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He regretted hisinitial plan, which had at first seemed so practical to him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As hereached the fifth floor, he decided to give up the search, took hisleave of a friendly, young worker who wanted to lead him on stillfurther and went down the stairs.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But then the thought of how much timehe was wasting made him cross, he went back again and knocked at thefirst door on the fifth floor.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The first thing he saw in the small roomwas a large clock on the wall which already showed ten o'clock.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Isthere a joiner called Lanz who lives here?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
he asked.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Pardon?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"said ayoung woman with black, shining eyes who was, at that moment, washingchildren's underclothes in a bucket.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
She pointed her wet hand towardsthe open door of the adjoining room.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. thought he had stepped into a meeting.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"A medium sized, twowindowed room was filled with the most diverse crowd of people - nobodypaid any attention to the person who had just entered.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Close under itsceiling it was surrounded by a gallery which was also fully occupied andwhere the people could only stand bent down with their heads and theirbacks touching the ceiling.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K., who found the air too stuffy, steppedout again and said to the young woman, who had probably misunderstoodwhat he had said, ""I asked for a joiner, someone by the name of Lanz.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""Yes,"" said the woman, ""please go on in.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. would probably not havefollowed her if the woman had not gone up to him, taken hold of the doorhandle and said, ""I'll have to close the door after you, no-one elsewill be allowed in.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Very sensible,"" said K., ""but it's too fullalready.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But then he went back in anyway.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He passed through betweentwo men who were talking beside the door - one of them held both handsfar out in front of himself making the movements of counting out money,the other looked him closely in the eyes - and someone took him by thehand.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was a small, red-faced youth.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Come in, come in,"" he said.K.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"let himself be led by him, and it turned out that there was -surprisingly in a densely packed crowd of people moving to and fro - anarrow passage which may have been the division between two factions;this idea was reinforced by the fact that in the first few rows to theleft and the right of him there was hardly any face looking in hisdirection, he saw nothing but the backs of people directing their speechand their movements only towards members of their own side.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Most ofthem were dressed in black, in old, long, formal frock coats that hungdown loosely around them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"These clothes were the only thing thatpuzzled  K., as he would otherwise have taken the whole assembly for alocal political meeting.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At the other end of the hall where K. had been led there was alittle table set at an angle on a very low podium which was asovercrowded as everywhere else, and behind the table, near the edge ofthe podium, sat a small, fat, wheezing man who was talking with someonebehind him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This second man was standing with his legs crossed and hiselbows on the backrest of the chair, provoking much laughter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
From timeto time he threw his arm in the air as if doing a caricature of someone.The youth who was leading K. had some difficulty in reporting to theman.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had already tried twice to tell him something, standing on tip-toe, but without getting the man's attention as he sat there above him.It was only when one of the people up on the podium drew his attentionto the youth that the man turned to him and leant down to hear what itwas he quietly said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then he pulled out his watch and quickly lookedover at K.  ""You should have been here one hour and five minutes ago,""he said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. was going to give him a reply but had no time to do so, ashardly had the man spoken than a general muttering arose all over theright hand side of the hall.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You should have been here one hour andfive minutes ago,"" the man now repeated, raising his voice this time,and quickly looked round the hall beneath him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The muttering alsobecame immediately louder and, as the man said nothing more, died awayonly gradually.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Now the hall was much quieter than when K. had entered.Only the people up in the gallery had not stopped passing remarks.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Asfar as could be distinguished, up in the half-darkness, dust and haze,they seemed to be less well dressed than those below.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Many of them hadbrought pillows that they had put between their heads and the ceiling sothat they would not hurt themselves pressed against it.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. had decided he would do more watching than talking, so he didnot defend himself for supposedly having come late, and simply said,""Well maybe I have arrived late, I'm here now.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There followed loudapplause, once more from the right hand side of the hall.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Easy peopleto get on your side, thought K., and was bothered only by the quiet fromthe left hand side which was directly behind him and from which therewas applause from only a few individuals.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He wondered what he could sayto get all of them to support him together or, if that were notpossible, to at least get the support of the others for a while.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said the man, ""but I'm now no longer under any obligationto hear your case"" - there was once more a muttering, but this time itwas misleading as the man waved the people's objections aside with hishand and continued - ""I will, however, as an exception, continue with ittoday.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But you should never arrive late like this again.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And now, stepforward!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Someone jumped down from the podium so that there would be aplace free for K., and K. stepped up onto it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He stood pressed closelyagainst the table, the press of the crowd behind him was so great thathe had to press back against it if he did not want to push the judge'sdesk down off the podium and perhaps the judge along with it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The judge, however, paid no attention to that but sat verycomfortably on his chair and, after saying a few words to close hisdiscussion with the man behind him, reached for a little note book, theonly item on his desk.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was like an old school exercise book and hadbecome quite misshapen from much thumbing.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Now then,"" said the judge,thumbing through the book.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He turned to K. with the tone of someone whoknows his facts and said, ""you are a house painter?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No,"" said K., ""Iam the chief clerk in a large bank.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This reply was followed bylaughter among the right hand faction down in the hall, it was so heartythat K. couldn't stop himself joining in with it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The people supportedthemselves with their hands on their knees and shook as if suffering aserious attack of coughing.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Even some of those in the gallery werelaughing.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no powerover those below him in the hall, he tried to reduce what harm had beendone in the gallery and jumped up threatening them, his eyebrows, untilthen hardly remarkable, pushed themselves up and became big, black andbushy over his eyes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The left hand side of the hall was still quiet, though, the peoplestood there in rows with their faces looking towards the podiumlistening to what was being said there, they observed the noise from theother side of the hall with the same quietness and even allowed someindividuals from their own ranks, here and there, to go forward into theother faction.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The people in the left faction were not only fewer innumber than the right but probably were no more important than them,although their behaviour was calmer and that made it seem like theywere.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
When K. now began to speak he was convinced he was doing it inthe same way as them.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Your question, My Lord, as to whether I am a house painter - infact even more than that, you did not ask at all but merely imposed iton me - is symptomatic of the whole way these proceedings against me arebeing carried out.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Perhaps you will object that there are noproceedings against me.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You will be quite right, as there areproceedings only if I acknowledge that there are.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But, for the moment,I do acknowledge it, out of pity for yourselves to a large extent.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It'simpossible not to observe all this business without feeling pity.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Idon't say things are being done without due care but I would like tomake it clear that it is I who make the acknowledgement.""K.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
stopped speaking and looked down into the hall.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had spokensharply, more sharply than he had intended, but he had been quite right.It should have been rewarded with some applause here and there buteverything was quiet, they were all clearly waiting for what wouldfollow, perhaps the quietness was laying the ground for an outbreak ofactivity that would bring this whole affair to an end.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was somewhatdisturbing that just then the door at the end of the hall opened, theyoung washerwoman, who seemed to have finished her work, came in and,despite all her caution, attracted the attention of some of the peoplethere.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was only the judge who gave K. any direct pleasure, as heseemed to have been immediately struck by K.'s words.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Until then, hehad listened to him standing, as K.'s speech had taken him by surprisewhile he was directing his attention to the gallery.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now, in the pause,he sat down very slowly, as if he did not want anyone to notice.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Hetook out the notebook again, probably so that he could give theimpression of being calmer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That won't help you, sir,"" continued K., ""even your little bookwill only confirm what I say.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. was satisfied to hear nothing but hisown quiet words in this room full of strangers, and he even daredcasually to pick up the examining judge's notebook and, touching it onlywith the tips of his fingers as if it were something revolting, liftedit in the air, holding it just by one of the middle pages so that theothers on each side of it, closely written, blotted and yellowing,flapped down.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Those are the official notes of the examining judge,"" hesaid, and let the notebook fall down onto the desk.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You can read inyour book as much as you like, sir, I really don't have anything in thischarge book to be afraid of, even though I don't have access to it as Iwouldn't want it in my hand, I can only touch it with two fingers.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thejudge grabbed the notebook from where it had fallen on the desk - whichcould only have been a sign of his deep humiliation, or at least that ishow it must have been perceived - tried to tidy it up a little, and heldit once more in front of himself in order to read from it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The people in the front row looked up at him, showing such tensionon their faces that he looked back down at them for some time.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Everyone of them was an old man, some of them with white beards.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Could theyperhaps be the crucial group who could turn the whole assembly one wayor the other?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They had sunk into a state of  motionlessness while K.gave his oration, and it had not been possible to raise them from thispassivity even when the judge was being humiliated.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""What has happenedto me,"" continued K., with less of the vigour he had had earlier, hecontinually scanned the faces in the first row, and this gave hisaddress a somewhat nervous and distracted character, ""what has happenedto me is not just an isolated case.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If it were it would not be of muchimportance as it's not of much importance to me, but it is a symptom ofproceedings which are carried out against many.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It's on behalf of themthat I stand here now, not for myself alone.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Without having intended it, he had raised his voice.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Somewhere inthe hall, someone raised his hands and applauded him shouting, ""Bravo!Why not then?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Bravo!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Again I say, Bravo!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Some of the men in thefirst row groped around in their beards, none of them looked round tosee who was shouting.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Not even K. thought him of any importance but itdid raise his spirits; he no longer thought it at all necessary that allof those in the hall should applaud him, it was enough if the majorityof them began  to think about the matter and if only one of them, nowand then, was persuaded.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'm not trying to be a successful orator,"" said K. after thisthought, ""that's probably more than I'm capable of anyway.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I'm sure theexamining judge can speak far better than I can, it is part of his jobafter all.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All that I want is a public discussion of a public wrong.Listen: ten days ago I was placed under arrest, the arrest itself issomething I laugh about but that's beside the point.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
They came for mein the morning when I was still in bed.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Maybe the order had been givento arrest some house painter - that seems possible after what the judgehas said - someone who is as innocent as I am, but it was me they chose.There were two police thugs occupying the next room.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
They could nothave taken better precautions if I had been a dangerous robber.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Andthese policemen were unprincipled riff-raff, they talked at me till Iwas sick of it, they wanted bribes, they wanted to trick me into givingthem my clothes, they wanted money, supposedly so that they could bringme my breakfast after they had blatantly eaten my own breakfast in frontof my eyes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
And even that was not enough.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
I was led in front of thesupervisor in another room.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This was the room of a lady who I have alot of respect for, and I was forced to look on while the supervisor andthe policemen made quite a mess of this room because of me, although notthrough any fault of mine.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was not easy to stay calm, but I managedto do so and was completely calm when I asked the supervisor why it wasthat I was under arrest.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If he were here he would have to confirm whatI say.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I can see him now, sitting on the chair belonging to that lady Imentioned - a picture of dull-witted arrogance.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
What do you think heanswered?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"What he told me, gentlemen, was basically nothing at all;perhaps he really did know nothing, he had placed me under arrest andwas satisfied.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
In fact he had done more than that and brought threejunior employees from the bank where I work into the lady's room; theyhad made themselves busy interfering with some photographs that belongedto the lady and causing a mess.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There was, of course, another reasonfor bringing these employees; they, just like my landlady and her maid,were expected to spread the news of my arrest and damage my publicreputation and in particular to remove me from my position at the bank.Well they didn't succeed in any of that, not in the slightest, even mylandlady, who is quite a simple person - and I will give you here hername in full respect, her name is Mrs. Grubach - even Mrs. Grubach wasunderstanding enough to see that an arrest like this has no moresignificance than an attack carried out on the street by some youths whoare not kept under proper control.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I repeat, this whole affair hascaused me nothing but unpleasantness and temporary irritation, but couldit not also have had some far worse consequences?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. broke off here and looked at the judge, who said nothing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Ashe did so he thought he saw the judge use a movement of his eyes to givea sign to someone in the crowd.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. smiled and said, ""And now the judge,right next to me, is giving a secret sign to someone among you.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Thereseems to be someone among you who is taking directions from above.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Idon't know whether the sign is meant to produce booing or applause, butI'll resist trying to guess what its meaning is too soon.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It reallydoesn't matter to me, and I give his lordship the judge my full andpublic permission to stop giving secret signs to his paid subordinatedown there and give his orders in words instead; let him just say ""Boonow!,"" and then the next time ""Clap now!"".",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Whether it was embarrassment or impatience, the judge rockedbackwards and forwards on his seat.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The man behind him, whom he hadbeen talking with earlier, leant forward again, either to give him a fewgeneral words of encouragement or some specific piece of advice.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Belowthem in the hall the people talked to each other quietly but animatedly.The two factions  had earlier seemed to hold views strongly opposed toeach other but now they began to intermingle, a few individuals pointedup at K., others pointed at the judge.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The air in the room was fuggyand extremely oppressive, those who were standing furthest away couldhardly even be seen through it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It must have been especiallytroublesome for those visitors who were in the gallery, as they wereforced to quietly ask the participants in the assembly what exactly washappening, albeit with timid glances at the judge.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The replies theyreceived were just as quiet, and given behind the protection of a raisedhand.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I have nearly finished what I have to say,"" said K., and as therewas no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way thatstartled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from eachother.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""None of this concerns me, and I am therefore able to make a calmassessment of it, and, assuming that this so-called court is of any realimportance, it will be very much to your advantage to listen to what Ihave to say.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If you want to discuss what I say, please don't bother towrite it down until later on, I don't have any time to waste and I'llsoon be leaving.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There was immediate silence, which showed how well K. was incontrol of the crowd.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There were no shouts among them as there had beenat the start, no-one even applauded, but if they weren't alreadypersuaded they seemed very close to it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K was pleased at the tension among all the people there as theylistened to him, a rustling rose from the silence which was moreinvigorating than the most ecstatic applause could have been.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""There isno doubt,"" he said quietly, ""that there is some enormous organisationdetermining what is said by this court.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In my case this includes myarrest and the examination taking place here today, an organisation thatemploys policemen who can be bribed, oafish supervisors and judges ofwhom nothing better can be said than that they are not as arrogant assome others.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This organisation even maintains a high-level judiciaryalong with its train of countless servants, scribes, policemen and allthe other assistance that  it needs, perhaps even executioners andtorturers - I'm not afraid of using those words.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And what, gentlemen, isthe purpose of this enormous organisation?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Its purpose is to arrestinnocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which, asin my case, lead to no result.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
How are we to avoid those in officebecoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That isimpossible, not even the highest judge would be able to achieve that forhimself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back ofthose they arrest, that is why supervisors break into the homes ofpeople they do not know, that is why innocent people are humiliated infront of crowds rather than being given a proper trial.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The policemenonly talked about the warehouses where they put the property of thosethey arrest, I would like to see these warehouses where the hard wonpossessions of people under arrest is left to decay, if, that is, it'snot stolen by the thieving hands of the warehouse workers.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall,he shaded his eyes to see that far, as the dull light of day made thesmoke whitish and hard to see through.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was the washerwoman whom K.had recognised as a likely source of disturbance as soon as she hadentered.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was hard to see now whether it was her fault or not.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
K.could only see that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door andwas pressing himself against her.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But it was not her who was screaming,but the man, he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling.A small circle had formed around the two of them, the visitors near himin the gallery seemed delighted that the serious tone K. had introducedinto the gathering had been disturbed in this way.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K.'s first thoughtwas to run over there, and he also thought that everyone would want tobring things back into order there or at least to make the pair leavethe room, but the first row of people in front of him stayed were theywere, no-one moved and no-one let K. through.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the contrary, theystood in his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a handfrom somewhere - he did not have the time to turn round - took hold ofhis collar.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K., by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemedto him that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was beingtaken seriously, and, without any thought for what he was doing, hejumped down from the podium.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Now he stood face to face with the crowd.Had he judged the people properly?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Had he put too much faith in theeffect of his speech?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Had they been putting up a pretence all the timehe had been speaking, and now that he come to the end and to what mustfollow, were they tired of pretending?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"What faces they were, all aroundhim!",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Dark, little eyes flickered here and there, cheeks drooped downlike on drunken men, their long beards were thin and stiff, if they tookhold of them it was more like they were making their hands into claws,not as if they were taking hold of their own beards.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But underneaththose beards - and this was the real discovery made by K. - there werebadges of various sizes and colours shining on the collars of theircoats.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As far as he could see, every one of them was wearing one ofthese badges.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All of them belonged to the same group, even though theyseemed to be divided to the right and the left of him, and when hesuddenly turned round he saw the same badge on the collar of theexamining judge who calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""So,"" called out K, throwing his arms in the air as if this suddenrealisation needed more room, ""all of you are working for thisorganisation, I see now that you are all the very bunch of cheats andliars I've just been speaking about, you've all pressed yourselves inhere in order to listen in and snoop on me, you gave the impression ofhaving formed into factions, one of you even applauded me to test meout, and you wanted to learn how to trap an innocent man!",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Well, I hopeyou haven't come here for nothing, I hope you've either had some funfrom someone who expected you to defend his innocence or else - let goof me or I'll hit you,"" shouted K. to a quivery old man who had pressedhimself especially close to him - ""or else that you've actually learnedsomething.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And so I wish you good luck in your trade.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He briskly tookhis hat from where it lay on the edge of the table and, surrounded by asilence caused perhaps by the completeness of their surprise, pushed hisway to the exit.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"However, the examining judge seems to have moved evenmore quickly than K., as he was waiting for him at the doorway.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Onemoment,"" he said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. stood where he was, but looked at the door withhis hand already on its handle rather than at the judge.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I merelywanted to draw your attention,"" said the judge, ""to something you seemnot yet to be aware of: today, you have robbed yourself of theadvantages that a hearing of this sort always gives to someone who isunder arrest.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. laughed towards the door.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You bunch of louts,"" hecalled, ""you can keep all your hearings as a present from me,"" thenopened the door and hurried down the steps.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Behind him, the noise ofthe assembly rose as it became lively once more and probably began todiscuss these events as if making a scientific study of them.Chapter Three In the empty Courtroom - The Student - The Offices        Every day over the following week, K. expected another summons toarrive, he could not believe that his rejection of any more hearings hadbeen taken literally, and when the expected summons really had not comeby Saturday evening he took it to mean that he was expected, withoutbeing told, to appear at the same place at the same time.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"So on Sunday,he set out once more in the same direction, going without hesitation upthe steps and through the corridors; some of the people remembered himand greeted him from their doorways, but he no longer needed to askanyone the way and soon arrived at the right door.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was opened assoon as he knocked and, paying no attention to the woman he had seenlast time who was standing at the doorway, he was about to go straightinto the adjoining room when she said to him ""There's no session today"".",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""What do you mean; no session?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"he asked, unable to believe it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But thewoman persuaded him by opening the door to the next room.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was indeedempty, and looked even more dismal empty than it had the previousSunday.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
On the podium stood the table exactly as it had been beforewith a few books laying on it.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Can I have a look at those books?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""asked K., not because he was especially curious but so that he would nothave come for nothing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No,"" said the woman as she re-closed the door,""that's not allowed.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Those books belong to the examining judge.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Isee,"" said K., and nodded, ""those books must be law books, and that'show this court does things, not only to try people who are innocent buteven to try them without letting them know what's going on.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I expectyou're right,"" said the woman, who had not understood exactly what hemeant.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'd better go away again, then,"" said K.""Should I give a message to the examining judge?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
asked the woman.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Doyou know him, then?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K.  ""Of course I know him,"" said the woman,""my husband is the court usher.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was only now that K. noticed thatthe room, which before had held nothing but a wash-tub, had been fittedout as a living room.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The woman saw how surprised he was and said,""Yes, we're allowed to live here as we like, only we have to clear theroom out when the court's in session.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There's lots of disadvantages tomy husband's job.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's not so much the room that surprises me,"" saidK., looking at her crossly, ""it's your being married that shocks me.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""Are you thinking about what happened last time the court was insession, when I disturbed what you were saying?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
asked the woman.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Ofcourse,"" said K., ""it's in the past now and I've nearly forgotten aboutit, but at the time it made me furious.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And now you tell me yourselfthat you are a married woman.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It wasn't any disadvantage for you tohave your speech interrupted.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"""Do you believe you really will be able to makethings better?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. smiled and twisted his hand round a little in hersoft hands.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's really not my job to make things better here, as youput it,"" he said, ""and if you said that to the examining judge he wouldlaugh at you or punish you for it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I really would not have becomeinvolved in this matter if I could have helped it, and I would have lostno sleep worrying about how this court needs to be made better.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Butbecause I'm told that I have been arrested - and I am under arrest - itforces me to take some action, and to do so for my own sake.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"The books were oldand well worn, the cover of one of them had nearly broken through in itsmiddle, and it was held together with a few threads.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Everything is sodirty here,"" said K., shaking his head, and before he could pick thebooks up the woman wiped some of the dust off with her apron.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. tookhold of the book that lay on top and threw it open, an indecent pictureappeared.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"A man and a woman sat naked on a sofa, the base intent ofwhoever drew it was easy to see but he had been so grossly lacking inskill that all that anyone could really make out were the man and thewoman who dominated the picture with their bodies, sitting in overlyupright postures that created a false perspective and made it difficultfor them to approach each other.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. didn't thumb through that book anymore, but just threw open the next one at its title page, it was a novelwith the title, What Grete Suffered from her Husband, Hans.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"So that's what all this is about, thought K., she'soffering herself to me, she's as degenerate as everything else aroundhere, she's had enough of the court officials, which is understandable Isuppose, and so she approaches any stranger and makes compliments abouthis eyes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"With that, K. stood up in silence as if he had spoken histhoughts out loud and thus explained his action to the woman.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I don'tthink you can be of any assistance to me,"" he said, ""to be of any realassistance you would need to be in contact with high officials.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"And that's even presupposing it ever even reaches anyconclusion, which I very much doubt.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I think it's much more likely thatthe court officials will be too lazy, too forgetful, or even to fearfulever to continue with these proceedings and that they will soon beabandoned if they haven't been abandoned already.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It's even possiblethat they will pretend to be carrying on with the trial in the hope ofreceiving a large bribe, although I can tell you now that that will bequite in vain as I pay bribes to no-one.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"There is no prospect of that, you cantell them that quite openly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

And I will make quitesure it is a blow against them.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Do you actually know the judge?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""Course I do,"" said the woman, ""he was the first one I thought of when Ioffered to help you.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"Mind you, I still think the report he givesto his superiors must have some influence.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
And he writes so manyreports.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You say these officials are lazy, but they're certainly notall lazy, especially this examining judge, he writes ever such a lot.Last Sunday, for instance, that session went on till the evening.Everyone had gone, but the examining judge, he stayed in the hall, I hadto bring him a lamp in, all I had was a little kitchen lamp but he wasvery satisfied with it and started to write straight away.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Meantime myhusband arrived, he always has the day off on Sundays, we got thefurniture back in and got our room sorted out and then a few of theneighbours came, we sat and talked for a bit by a candle, in short, weforgot all about the examining judge and went to bed.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All of a suddenin the night, it must have been quite late in the night, I wakes up,next to the bed, there's the examining judge shading the lamp with hishand so that there's no light from it falls on my husband, he didn'tneed to be as careful as that, the way my husband sleeps the lightwouldn't have woken him up anyway.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I was quite shocked and nearlyscreamed, but the judge was very friendly, warned me I should becareful, he whispered to me he's been writing all this time, and nowhe's brought me the lamp back, and he'll never forget how I looked whenhe found me there asleep.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"What I mean, with all this, I just wanted totell you how the examining judge really does write lots of reports,especially about you as questioning you was definitely one of the mainthings on the agenda that Sunday.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If he writes reports as long as thatthey must be of some importance.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And besides all that, you can seefrom what happened that the examining judge is after me, and it's rightnow, when he's first begun to notice me, that I can have a lot ofinfluence on him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And I've got other proof I mean a lot to him, too.Yesterday, he sent that student to me, the one he really trusts and whohe works with, he sent him with a present for me, silk stockings.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Hesaid it was because I clear up in the courtroom but that's only apretence, that job's no more than what I'm supposed to do, it's what myhusband gets paid for.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nice stockings, they are, look,"" - she stretchedout her leg, drew her skirt up to her knee and looked, herself, at thestocking - ""they are nice stockings, but they're too good for me,really.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K.'s as ifshe wanted to calm him down, and whispered, ""Be quiet, Berthold iswatching us.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. slowly looked up.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In the doorway to the courtroomstood a young man, he was short, his legs were not quite straight, andhe continually moved his finger round in a short, thin, red beard withwhich he hoped to make himself look dignified.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. looked at him withsome curiosity, he was the first student he had ever met of theunfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man whowould even most likely attain high office one day.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The student, incontrast, seemed to take no notice of K. at all, he merely withdrew hisfinger from his beard long enough to beckon to the woman and went overto the window, the woman leant over to K. and whispered, ""Don't be crosswith me, please don't, and please don't think ill of me either, I've gotto go to him now, to this horrible man, just look at his bent legs.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"ButI'll come straight back and then I'll go with you if you'll take me,I'll go wherever you want, you can do whatever you like with me, I'll behappy if I can be away from here for as long as possible, it'd be bestif I could get away from here for good.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She stroked K.'s hand oncemore, jumped up and ran over to the window.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"He really was attractedto the woman, and even after thinking hard about it could find no goodreason why he should not give in to her allure.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It briefly crossed hismind that the woman meant to entrap him on behalf of the court, but thatwas an objection he had no difficulty in fending off.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
In what way couldshe entrap him?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Was he not still free, so free that he could crush theentire court whenever he wanted, as least where it concerned him?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Couldhe not have that much confidence in himself?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And her offer of helpsounded sincere, and maybe it wasn't quite worthless.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
And maybe therewas no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies thanto take this woman from him and have her for himself.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Maybe then, aftermuch hard work writing dishonest reports about K., the judge would go tothe woman's bed late one night and find it empty.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And it would be emptybecause she belonged to K., because this woman at the window, this lush,supple, warm body in its sombre clothes of rough, heavy materialbelonged to him, totally to him and to him alone.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Once he had settledhis thoughts towards the woman in this way, he began to find the quietconversation at the window was taking too long, he rapped on the podiumwith his knuckles, and then even with his fist.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The student brieflylooked away from the woman to glance at K. over his shoulder but didallow himself to be disturbed, in fact he even pressed himself close tothe woman and put his arms around her.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She dropped her head down low asif listening to him carefully, as she did so he kissed her right on theneck, hardly even interrupting what he was saying.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. saw this asconfirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and whichshe had already complained about, he stood up and walked up and down theroom.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Glancing sideways at the student, he wondered what would be thequickest possible way to get rid of him, and so it was not unwelcome tohim when the student, clearly disturbed by K.'s to-ing and fro-ing whichK.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"had now developed into a stamping up and down, said to him,""You don't have to stay here, you know, if you're getting impatient.You could have gone earlier, no-one would have missed you.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In fact youshould have gone, you should have left as quickly as possible as soon asI got here.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This comment could have caused all possible rage to breakout between them, but K. also bore in mind that this was a prospectivecourt official speaking to a disfavoured defendant, and he might wellhave been taking pride in speaking in this way.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. remained standingquite close to him and said with a smile, ""You're quite right, I amimpatient, but the easiest way to settle this impatience would be if youleft us.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the other hand, if you've come here to study - you are astudent, I hear - I'll be quite happy to leave the room to you and goaway with the woman.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
I'm sure you'll still have a lot of study to dobefore you're made into a judge.,Franz Kafka,The Trial

"In this way he showed, unmistakeably, that he was to some extentafraid of K., but he nonetheless dared to provoke him still further bystroking and squeezing the woman's arm with his free hand.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. ran thefew steps up to him, but when he had reached him and was about to takehold of him and, if necessary, throttle him, the woman said, ""It's nogood, it's the examining judge who's sent for me, I daren't go with you,this little bastard..."" and here she ran her hand over the student'sface, ""this little bastard won't let me.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""And you don't want to be setfree!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"shouted K., laying his hand on the student's shoulder, who thensnapped at it with his teeth.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"shouted the woman, pushing K. awaywith both hands, ""no, no don't do that, what d'you think you're doing!",Franz Kafka,The Trial
?That'd be the end of me.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Let go of him, please just let go of him.He's only carrying out the judge's orders, he's carrying me to him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""Let him take you then, and I want to see nothing more of you,"" said K.,enraged by his disappointment and giving the student a thump in the backso that he briefly stumbled and then, glad that he had not fallen,immediately jumped up all the higher with his burden.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. followed themslowly.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
He realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he hadsuffered from these people.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was of course nothing to worry about, heaccepted the setback only because he was looking for a fight.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If hestayed at home and carried on with his normal life he would be athousand times superior to these people and could get any of them out ofhis way just with a kick.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And he imagined the most laughable scenepossible as an example of this, if this contemptible student, thisinflated child, this knock-kneed redbeard, if he were kneeling at Elsa'sbed wringing his hands and begging for forgiveness.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. so enjoyedimagining this scene that he decided to take the student along to Elsawith him if ever he should get the opportunity.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. was curious to see where the woman would be taken and hehurried over to the door, the student was not likely to carry herthrough the streets on his arm.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It turned out that the journey was farshorter.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Directly opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of woodensteps which probably led up to the attic, they turned as they went sothat it was not possible to see where they ended.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The student carriedthe woman up these steps, and after the exertions of running with her hewas soon groaning and moving very slowly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The woman waved down at K.and by raising and lowering her shoulders she tried to show that she wasan innocent party in this abduction, although the gesture did not show alot of regret.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. watched her without expression like a stranger, hewanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easilyget over his disappointment.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The two of them had disappeared, but K. remained standing in thedoorway.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He had to accept that the woman had not only cheated him butthat she had also lied to him when she said she was being taken to theexamining judge.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
The examining judge certainly wouldn't be sitting andwaiting in the attic.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
The wooden stairs would explain nothing to himhowever long he stared at them.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then K. noticed a small piece of papernext to them, went across to it and read, in a childish and unpractisedhand, ""Entrance to the Court Offices"".",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Were the court offices here, inthe attic of this tenement, then?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If that was how they wereaccommodated it did not attract much respect, and it was some comfortfor the accused to realise how little money this court had at itsdisposal if it had to locate its offices in a place where the tenants ofthe building, who were themselves among the poorest of people, wouldthrow their unneeded junk.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the other hand, it was possible that theofficials  had enough money but that they squandered it on themselvesrather than use it for the court's purposes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Going by K.'s experienceof them so far, that even seemed probable, except that if the court wereallowed to decay in that way it would not just humiliate the accused butalso give him more encouragement than if the court were simply  in astate of poverty.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. also now understood that the court was ashamed tosummon those it accused to the attic of this building for the initialhearing, and why it preferred to impose upon them in their own homes.What a position it was that K. found himself in, compared with the judgesitting up in the attic!",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K., at the bank, had a big office with anante-room, and had an enormous window through which he could look downat the activity in the square.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was true, though, that he had nosecondary income from bribes and fraud, and he couldn't tell a servantto bring him a woman up to the office on his arm.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K., however, wasquite willing to do without such things, in this life at least.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. wasstill looking at the notice when a man came up the stairs, lookedthrough the open door into the living room where it was also possible tosee the courtroom, and finally asked K. whether he had just seen a womanthere.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You're the court usher, aren't you?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K.  ""That's right,""said the man, ""oh, yes, you're defendant K., I recognise you now aswell.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nice to see you here.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And he offered K. his hand, which was farfrom what K. had expected.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And when K. said nothing, he added, ""There'sno court session planned for today, though.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I know that,"" said K. ashe looked at the usher's civilian coat which, beside its ordinarybuttons, displayed two gilded ones as the only sign of his office andseemed to have been taken from an old army officer's coat.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I wasspeaking with your wife a little while ago.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
She is no longer here.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thestudent has carried her off to the examining judge.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Listen to this,""said the usher, ""they're always carrying her away from me.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It's Sundaytoday, and it's not part of my job to do any work today, but they sendme off with some message which isn't even necessary just to get me awayfrom here.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
What they do is they send me off not too far away so that Ican still hope to get back on time if I really hurry.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"So off I gorunning as fast as I can, shout the message through the crack in thedoor of the office I've been sent to, so out of breath they'll hardly beable to understand it, run back here again, but the student's been evenfaster than I have - well he's got less far to go, he's only got to rundown the steps.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If I wasn't so dependent on them I'd have squashed thestudent against the wall here a long time ago.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Right here, next to thesign.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
I'm always dreaming of doing that.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Just here, just above thefloor, that's where he's crushed onto the wall, his arms stretched out,his fingers spread apart, his crooked legs twisted round into a circleand blood squirted out all around him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It's only ever been a dream sofar, though.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Is there nothing else you do?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
asked K. with a smile.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Nothing that I know of,"" said the usher.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""And it's going to get evenworse now, up till now he's only been carrying her off for himself, nowhe's started carrying her off for the judge and all, just like I'dalways said he would.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Does your wife, then, not share some of theresponsibility?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K.  He had to force himself as he asked thisquestion, as he, too, felt so jealous now.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Course she does,"" said theusher, ""it's more her fault than theirs.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was her who attachedherself to him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All he did, he just chases after any woman.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
There'sfive flats in this block alone where he's been thrown out after workinghis way in there.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And my wife is the best looking woman in the wholebuilding, but it's me who's not even allowed to defend himself.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Ifthat's how things are, then there's nothing that can be done,"" said K.""Well why not?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
asked the usher.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""He's a coward that student, if hewants to lay a finger on my wife all you'd have to do is give him such agood hiding he'd never dare do it again.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But I'm not allowed to dothat, and nobody else is going to do me the favour as they're all afraidof his power.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The only one who could do it is a man like you.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""What,how could I do it?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
asked K. in astonishment.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Well you're facing a charge, aren't you,"" said the usher.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes, butthat's all the more reason for me to be afraid.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Even if he has noinfluence on the outcome of the trial he probably has some on theinitial examination.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes, exactly,"" said the usher, as if K.'s viewhad been just as correct as his own.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Only we don't usually get anytrials heard here with no hope at all.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I am not of the same opinion"",said K., ""although that ought not to prevent me from dealing with thestudent if the opportunity arises.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I would be very grateful to you,""said the usher of the court, somewhat formally, not really seeming tobelieve that his highest wish could be fulfilled.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Perhaps,"" continuedK., ""perhaps there are some other officials of yours here, perhaps allof them, who would deserve the same.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Oh yes, yes,"" said the usher, asif this was a matter of course.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then he looked at K. trustingly which,despite all his friendliness, he had not done until then, and added,""they're always rebelling.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But the conversation seemed to have becomea little uncomfortable for him, as he broke it off by saying, ""now Ihave to report to the office.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Would you like to come with me?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""There's nothing for me to do there,"" said K.""You'd be able to have a look at it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"""Is it worth seeing then?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K. hesitatingly, although hefelt very keen to go with him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Well,"" said the usher, ""I thought you'dbe interested in it.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Alright then,"" said K. finally, ""I'll come withyou.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And, quicker than the usher himself, he ran up the steps.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At the entrance he nearly fell over, as behind the door there wasanother step.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""They don't show much concern for the public,"" he said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""They don't show any concern at all,"" said the usher, ""just look at thewaiting room here.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It consisted of a long corridor from which roughlymade doors led out to the separate departments of the attic.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There wasno direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of thedepartments, instead of solid walls, had just wooden bars reaching up tothe ceiling to separate them from the corridor.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The light made its wayin through them, and it was also possible to see individual officialsthrough them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at thewooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through thegaps.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There were only a few people in the corridor, probably because itwas Sunday.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
They were not very impressive.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They sat, equally spaced,on two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along bothsides of the corridor.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All of them were carelessly dressed although theexpressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards andmany details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged tothe upper classes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There were no coat hooks for them to use, and sothey had placed their hats under the bench, each probably havingfollowed the example of the others.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When those who were sitting nearestthe door saw K. and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them,and when the others saw that, they also thought they had to greet them,so that as the two of them went by all the people there stood up.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Noneof them stood properly upright, their backs were bowed, their kneesbent, they stood like beggars on the street.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. waited for the usher,who was following just behind him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""They must all be very dispirited,""he said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said the usher, ""they are the accused, everyone you seehere has been accused.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Really!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"said K.  ""They're colleagues of minethen.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And he turned to the nearest one, a tall, thin man with hairthat was nearly grey.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""What is it you are waiting for here?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K.,politely, but the man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly,which was all the more pitiful to see because the man clearly had someexperience of the world and elsewhere would certainly have been able toshow his superiority and would not have easily given up the advantage hehad acquired.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Here, though, he did not know what answer to give to sucha simple question and looked round at the others as if they were undersome obligation to help him, and as if no-one could expect any answerfrom him without this help.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then the usher of the court stepped forwardto him and, in order to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, ""Thegentleman here's only asking what it is you're waiting for.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You cangive him an answer.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The voice of the usher was probably familiar tohim, and had a better effect than K.'s.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'm ...",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I'm waiting ..."" hebegan, and then came to a halt.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had clearly chosen this beginning sothat he could give a precise answer to the question, but now he didn'tknow how to continue.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Some of the others waiting had come closer andstood round the group, the usher of the court said to them, ""Get out theway, keep the gangway free.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They moved back slightly, but not as faras where they had been sitting before.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In the meantime, the man whom K.had first approached had pulled himself together and even answered himwith a smile.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""A month ago I made some applications for evidence to be heard in mycase, and I'm waiting for it to be settled.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You certainly seem to begoing to a lot of effort,"" said K.  ""Yes,"" said the man, ""it is myaffair after all.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Not everyone thinks the same way as you do,"" saidK.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I've been indicted as well but I swear on my soul that I've neithersubmitted evidence nor done anything else of the sort.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Do you reallythink that's necessary?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I don't really know, exactly,"" said the man,once more totally unsure of himself; he clearly thought K. was jokingwith him and therefore probably thought it best to repeat his earlieranswer in order to avoid making any new mistakes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"With K. looking athim impatiently, he just said, ""as far as I'm concerned, I've applied tohave this evidence heard.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Perhaps you don't believe I've beenindicted?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K.  ""Oh, please, I certainly do,"" said the man,stepping slightly to one side, but there was more anxiety in his answerthan belief.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You don't believe me then?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K., and took hold ofhis arm, unconsciously prompted by the man's humble demeanour, and as ifhe wanted to force him to believe him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But he did not want to hurt theman and had only taken hold of him very lightly.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nonetheless, the mancried out as if K. had grasped him not with two fingers but with red hottongs.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Shouting in this ridiculous way finally made K. tired of him, ifhe didn't believe he was indicted then so much the better; maybe he eventhought K. was a judge.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And before leaving, he held him a lot harder,shoved him back onto the bench and walked on.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""These defendants are sosensitive, most of them,"" said the usher of the court.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Almost all ofthose who had been waiting had now assembled around the man who, by now,had stopped shouting and they seemed to be asking him lots of precisequestions about the incident.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. was approached by a security guard,identifiable mainly by his sword, of which the scabbard seemed to bemade of aluminium.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This greatly surprised K., and he reached out for itwith his hand.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The guard had come because of the shouting and askedwhat had been happening.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The usher of the court said a few words to tryand calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into ithimself, saluted, and hurried on, walking with very short steps,probably because of gout.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people,especially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along iton the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going thatway.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go, the ushernodded, and that is the way that K. went.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The usher remained always oneor two steps behind K, which he found irritating as in a place like thisit could give the impression that he was being driven along by someonewho had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the usher to catch up,but the usher always remained behind him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In order to put an end to hisdiscomfort, K. finally said, ""Now that I've seen what it looks likehere, I'd like to go.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You haven't seen everything yet,"" said theusher ingenuously.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I don't want to see everything,"" said K., who was also feeling verytired, ""I want to go, what is the way to the exit?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You haven't gotlost, have you?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked the usher in amazement, ""you go down this way tothe corner, then right down the corridor straight ahead as far as thedoor.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Come with me,"" said K., ""show me the way, I'll miss it, thereare so many different ways here.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's the only way there is,"" saidthe usher, who had now started to sound quite reproachful, ""I can't goback with you again, I've got to hand in my report, and I've alreadylost a lot of time because of you as it is.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Come with me!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K.repeated, now somewhat sharper as if he had finally caught the usher outin a lie.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Don't shout like that,"" whispered the usher, ""there'soffices all round us here.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If you don't want to go back by yourselfcome on a bit further with me or else wait here till I've sorted out myreport, then I'll be glad to go back with you again.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No, no,"" saidK., ""I will not wait and you must come with me now.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. had still notlooked round at anything at all in the room where he found himself, andit was only when one of the many wooden doors all around him opened thathe noticed it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"A young woman, probably summoned by the loudness of K.'svoice, entered and asked, ""What is it the gentleman wants?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
In thedarkness behind her there was also a man approaching.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. looked at theusher.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had, after all, said that no-one would take any notice of K.,and now there were two people coming, it only needed a few and everyonein the office would become aware of him and asking for explanations asto why he was there.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The only understandable and acceptable thing tosay was that he was accused of something and wanted to know the date ofhis next hearing, but this was an explanation he did not want to give,especially as it was not true - he had only come out of curiosity.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Orelse, an explanation even less usable, he could say that he wanted toascertain that the court was as revolting on the inside as it was on theoutside.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And it did seem that he had been quite right in thissupposition, he had no wish to intrude any deeper, he was disturbedenough by what he had seen already, he was not in the right frame ofmind just then to face a high official such as might appear from behindany door, and he wanted to go, either with the usher of the court or, ifneeds be, alone.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, andthe young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if theythought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second whichthey didn't want to miss seeing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
And in the doorway stood the man whomK.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"had noticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beamabove the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as ifbecoming impatient as he watched.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But the young woman was the first torecognise that K.'s behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell,she brought a chair and asked,""Would you not like to sit down?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. sat down immediately and, in orderto keep his place better, put his elbows on the armrests.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You're alittle bit dizzy, aren't you?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
she asked him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Her face was now close infront of him, it bore the severe expression that many young women havejust when they're in the bloom of their youth.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's nothing for you toworry about,"" she said, ""that's nothing unusual here, almost everyonegets an attack like that the first time they come here.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
This is yourfirst time is it?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Yes, it's nothing unusual then.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The sun burns downon the roof and the hot wood makes the air so thick and heavy.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It makesthis place rather unsuitable for offices, whatever other advantages itmight offer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But the air is almost impossible to breathe on days whenthere's a lot of business, and that's almost every day.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
And when youthink that there's a lot of washing put out to dry here as well - and wecan't stop the tenants doing that - it's not surprising you started tofeel unwell.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
But you get used to the air alright in the end.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Whenyou're here for the second or third time you'll hardly notice howoppressive the air is.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Are you feeling any better now?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. made noanswer, he felt too embarrassed at being put at the mercy of thesepeople by his sudden weakness, and learning the reason for feeling illmade him feel not better but a little worse.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The girl noticed itstraight away, and to make the air fresher for K., she took a windowpole that was leaning against the wall and pushed open a small hatchdirectly above K.'s head that led to the outside.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But so much soot fellin that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean thesoot off K.'s hands with her handkerchief, as K. was too tired to dothat for himself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He would have liked just to sit quietly where he wasuntil he had enough strength to leave, and the less fuss people madeabout him the sooner that would be.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But then the girl said, ""You can'tstay here, we're in people's way here ...""  K. looked at her as if toask whose way they were impeding.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""If you like, I can take you to thesick room,"" and turning to the man in the doorway said, ""please helpme"".",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The man immediately came over to them, but K. did not want to goto the sick room, that was just what he wanted to avoid, being ledfurther from place to place, the further he went the more difficult itmust become.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"So he said, ""I am able to walk now,"" and stood up, shakingafter becoming used to sitting so comfortably.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But then he was unableto stay upright.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I can't manage it,"" he said shaking his head, and satdown again with a sigh.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He remembered the usher who, despiteeverything, would have been able to lead him out of there but who seemedto have gone long before.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. looked out between the man and the youngwoman who were standing in front of him but was unable to find theusher.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I think,"" said the man, who was elegantly dressed and whoseappearance was made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that hadtwo long, sharply tailored points, ""the gentleman is feeling unwellbecause of the atmosphere here, so the best thing, and what he wouldmost prefer, would be not to take him to the sick room but get him outof the offices altogether.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That's right,"" exclaimed K., with such joythat he nearly interrupted what the man was saying, ""I'm sure that'llmake me feel better straight away, I'm really not that weak, all I needis a little support under my arms, I won't cause you much trouble, it'snot such a long way anyway, lead me to the door and then I'll sit on thestairs for a while and soon recover, as I don't suffer from attacks likethis at all, I'm surprised at it myself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"The rest of usI'm afraid, as you can see just by looking at me, dress very badly andold-fashioned; and there's not much point in spending much on clothesanyway, as we hardly ever leave the offices, we even sleep here.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But,as I said, we decided that the information-giver would have to have niceclothes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As the management here is rather peculiar in this respect, andthey would get them for us, we had a collection - some of the litigantscontributed too - and bought him these lovely clothes and some othersbesides.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"""Thank you both very much,"" saidK., pleasantly surprised, as he slowly rose and personally guided theseunfamiliar hands to the places where he most needed support.As they approached the corridor, the girl said quietly into K.'s ear, ""Imust seem to think it's very important to show the information-giver ina good light, but you shouldn't doubt what I say, I just want to say thetruth.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He isn't hard-hearted.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It's not really his job to helplitigants outside if they're unwell but he's doing it anyway, as you cansee.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I don't suppose any of us is hard-hearted, perhaps we'd all liketo be helpful, but working for the court offices it's easy for us togive the impression we are hard-hearted and don't want to help anyone.It makes me quite sad.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Would you not like to sit down here a while?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""asked the information-giver, there were already in the corridor and justin front of the defendant whom K. had spoken to earlier.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. felt almostashamed to be seen by him, earlier he had stood so upright in front ofhim and now he had to be supported by two others, his hat was held up bythe information-giver balanced on outstretched fingers, his hair wasdishevelled and hung down onto the sweat on his forehead.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But thedefendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stoodthere humbly, as if wanting to apologise to the information-giver forbeing there.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The information-giver looked past him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I know,"" he said,""that my case can't be settled today, not yet, but I've come in anyway,I thought, I thought I could wait here anyway, it's Sunday today, I'vegot plenty of time, and I'm not disturbing anyone here.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""There's noneed to be so apologetic,"" said the information-giver, ""it's verycommendable for you to be so attentive.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
You are taking up space herewhen you don't need to but as long as you don't get in my way I will donothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely asyou like.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
When one has seen so many people who shamefully neglect theircases one learns to show patience with people like you.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Do sit down.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""He's very good with the litigants,"" whispered the girl.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. nodded, butstarted to move off again when the information-giver repeated, ""Wouldyou not like to sit down here a while?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No,"" said K., ""I don't want torest.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had said that as decisively as he could, but in fact itwould have done him a lot of good to sit down.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was as if he weresuffering sea-sickness.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea,as if the water were hitting against the wooden walls, a thundering fromthe depths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it, asif the corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side ofit rising and sinking.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It made the calmness of the girl and the manleading him all the more incomprehensible.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He was at their mercy, ifthey let go of him he would fall like a board.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Their little eyesglanced here and there, K. could feel the evenness of their steps butcould not do the same, as from step to step he was virtually beingcarried.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He finally noticed they were speaking to him but he did notunderstand them, all he heard was a noise that filled all the space andthrough which there seemed to be an unchanging higher note sounding,like a siren.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Louder,"" he whispered with his head sunk low, ashamed athaving to ask them to speak louder when he knew they had spoken loudlyenough, even if it had been, for him, incomprehensible.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At last, adraught of cool air blew in his face as if a gap had been torn out inthe wall in front of him, and next to him he heard someone say, ""Firsthe says he wants to go, and then you can tell him a hundred times thatthis is the way out and he doesn't move.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. became aware that he wasstanding in front of the way out, and that the young woman had openedthe door.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It seemed to him that all his strength returned to him atonce, and to get a foretaste of freedom he stepped straight on to one ofthe stairs and took his leave there of his companions, who bowed to him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Thank you very much,"" he repeated, shook their hands once more and didnot let go until he thought he saw that they found it hard to bear thecomparatively fresh air from the stairway after being so long used tothe air in the offices.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They were hardly able to reply, and the youngwoman might even have fallen over if K. had not shut the door extremelyfast.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. then stood still for a while, combed his hair with the help ofa pocket mirror, picked up his hat from the next stair - theinformation-giver must have thrown it down there - and then he ran downthe steps so fresh and in such long leaps that the contrast with hisprevious state nearly frightened him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
His normally sturdy state ofhealth had never prepared him for surprises such as this.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Did his bodywant to revolt and cause him a new trial as he was bearing the old onewith such little effort?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He did not quite reject the idea that heshould see a doctor the next time he had the chance, but whatever he did- and this was something on which he could advise himself - he wanted tospend all Sunday mornings in future better than he had spent this one.Chapter FourMiss BÃ¼rstner's Friend        For some time after this, K. found it impossible to exchange evenjust a few words with Miss BÃ¼rstner.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He tried to reach her in many andvarious ways but she always found a way to avoid it.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He would comestraight home from the office, remain in her room without the light on,and sit on the sofa with nothing more to distract him than keeping watchon the empty hallway.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If the maid went by and closed the door of theapparently empty room he would get up after a while and open it again.He got up an hour earlier than usual in the morning so that he mightperhaps find Miss BÃ¼rstner alone as she went to the office.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
But none ofthese efforts brought any success.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then he wrote her a letter, both tothe office and the flat, attempting once more to justify his behaviour,offered to make whatever amends he could, promised never to crosswhatever boundary she might set him and begged merely to have the chanceto speak to her some time, especially as he was unable to do anythingwith Mrs. Grubach either until he had spoken with Miss BÃ¼rstner, hefinally informed her that the following Sunday he would stay in his roomall day waiting for a sign from her that there was some hope of hisrequest being fulfilled, or at least that she would explain to him whyshe could not fulfil it even though he had promised to observe whateverstipulations she might make.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The letters were not returned, but therewas no answer either.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"However, on the following Sunday there was a signthat seemed clear enough.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was still early when K. noticed, throughthe keyhole, that there was an unusual level of activity in the hallwaywhich soon abated.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"A French teacher, although she was German and calledMontag, a pale and febrile girl with a slight limp who had previouslyoccupied a room of her own, was moving into Miss BÃ¼rstner's room.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Shecould be seen shuffling through the hallway for several hours, there wasalways another piece of clothing or a blanket or a book that she hadforgotten and had to be fetched specially and brought into the new home.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When Mrs. Grubach brought K. his breakfast - ever since the timewhen she had made K. so cross she didn't trust the maid to do theslightest job - he had no choice but to speak to her, for the first timein five days.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Why is there so much noise in the hallway today?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"heasked as she poured his coffee out, ""Can't something be done about it?Does this clearing out have to be done on a Sunday?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. did not look upat Mrs. Grubach, but he saw nonetheless that she seemed to feel somerelief as she breathed in.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Even sharp questions like this from Mr. K.she perceived as forgiveness, or as the beginning of forgiveness.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""We're not clearing anything out, Mr. K.,"" she said, ""it's just thatMiss Montag is moving in with Miss BÃ¼rstner and is moving her thingsacross.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She said nothing more, but just waited to see how K. wouldtake it and whether he would allow her to carry on speaking.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But K.kept her in uncertainty, took the spoon and pensively stirred his coffeewhile he remained silent.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then he looked up at her and said, ""Whatabout the suspicions you had earlier about Miss BÃ¼rstner, have you giventhem up?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Mr. K.,"" called Mrs. Grubach, who had been waiting for thisvery question, as she put her hands together and held them out towardshim.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I just made a chance remark and you took it so badly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

And said I should give you notice!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Give you notice!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""At this last outcry, Mrs. Grubach was already choking back her tears,she raised her apron to her face and blubbered out loud.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Oh, don't cry Mrs. Grubach,"" said K., looking out the window, hewas thinking only of Miss BÃ¼rstner and how she was accepting an unknowngirl into her room.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Now don't cry,"" he said again as he turned hislook back into the room where Mrs. Grubach was still crying.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I meantno harm either when I said that.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was simply a misunderstandingbetween us.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That can happen even between old friends sometimes.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Mrs.Grubach pulled her apron down to below her eyes to see whether K. reallywas attempting a reconciliation.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Well, yes, that's how it is,"" saidK., and as Mrs. Grubach's behaviour indicated that the captain had saidnothing he dared to add, ""Do you really think, then, that I'd want tomake an enemy of you for the sake of a girl we hardly know?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,you're quite right, Mr. K.,"" said Mrs. Grubach, and then, to hermisfortune, as soon as she felt just a little freer to speak, she addedsomething rather inept.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I kept asking myself why it was that Mr. K.took such an interest in Miss BÃ¼rstner.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Why does he quarrel with meover her when he knows that any cross word from him and I can't sleepthat night?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And I didn't say anything about Miss BÃ¼rstner that I hadn'tseen with my own eyes.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. said nothing in reply, he should have chasedher from the room as soon as she had opened her mouth, and he didn'twant to do that.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He contented himself with merely drinking his coffeeand letting Mrs. Grubach feel that she was superfluous.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Outside, thedragging steps of Miss Montag could still be heard as she went from oneside of the hallway to the other.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Do you hear that?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
asked K. pointinghis hand at the door.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said Mrs. Grubach with a sigh, ""I wantedto give her some help and I wanted the maid to help her too but she'sstubborn, she wants to move everything in herself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
I wonder at MissBÃ¼rstner.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
I often feel it's a burden for me to have Miss Montag as atenant but Miss BÃ¼rstner accepts her into her room with herself.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""There's nothing there for you to worry about"" said K., crushing theremains of a sugar lump in his cup.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Does she cause you any trouble?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""No,"" said Mrs. Grubach, ""in itself it's very good to have her there, itmakes another room free for me and I can let my nephew, the captain,occupy it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I began to worry he might be disturbing you when I had tolet him live in the living room next to you over the last few days.He's not very considerate.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""What an idea!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"said K. standing up,""there's no question of that.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You seem to think that because I can'tstand this to-ing and fro-ing of Miss Montag that I'm over-sensitive -and there she goes back again.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Mrs. Grubach appeared quite powerless.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Should I tell her to leave moving the rest of her things over tilllater, then, Mr. K.?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If that's what you want I'll do it immediately.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""But she has to move in with Miss BÃ¼rstner!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"said K.  ""Yes,"" said Mrs.Grubach, without quite understanding what K. meant.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""So she has to takeher things over there.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Mrs. Grubach just nodded.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. was irritated allthe more by this dumb helplessness which, seen from the outside, couldhave seemed like a kind of defiance on her part.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He began to walk upand down the room between the window and the door, thus depriving Mrs.Grubach of the chance to leave, which she otherwise probably would havedone.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Just as K. once more reached the door, someone knocked at it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Itwas the maid, to say that Miss Montag would like to have a few wordswith Mr. K., and therefore requested that he come to the dining roomwhere she was waiting for him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. heard the maid out thoughtfully, andthen looked back at the shocked Mrs. Grubach in a way that was almostcontemptuous.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"His look seemed to be saying that K. had been expectingthis invitation for Miss Montag for a long time, and that it wasconfirmation of the suffering he had been made to endure that Sundaymorning from Mrs. Grubach's tenants.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He sent the maid back with thereply that he was on his way, then he went to the wardrobe to change hiscoat, and in answer to Mrs. Grubach's gentle whining about the nuisanceMiss Montag was causing merely asked her to clear away the breakfastthings.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""But you've hardly touched it,"" said Mrs. Grubach.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Oh justtake it away!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
shouted K.  It seemed to him that Miss Montag was mixedup in everything and made it repulsive to him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
As he went through the hallway he looked at the closed door ofMiss BÃ¼rstner's room.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But it wasn't there that he was invited, but thedining room, to which he yanked the door open without knocking.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The room was long but narrow with one window.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There was onlyenough space available to put two cupboards at an angle in the corner bythe door, and the rest of the room was entirely taken up with the longdining table which started by the door and reached all the way to thegreat window, which was thus made almost inaccessible.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The table wasalready laid for a large number of people, as on Sundays almost all thetenants ate their dinner here at midday.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When K. entered, Miss Montag came towards him from the windowalong one side of the table.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
They greeted each other in silence.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"ThenMiss Montag, her head unusually erect as always, said, ""I'm not surewhether you know me.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. looked at her with a frown.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Of course I do,""he said, ""you've been living here with Mrs. Grubach for quite some timenow.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""But I get the impression you don't pay much attention to what'sgoing on in the lodging house,""  said Miss Montag.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No,"" said K.""Would you not like to sit down?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
said Miss Montag.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In silence, the twoof them drew chairs out from the farthest end of the table and sat downfacing each other.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But Miss Montag stood straight up again as she hadleft her handbag on the window sill and went to fetch it; she shuffleddown the whole length of the room.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When she came back, the handbaglightly swinging, she said, ""I'd like just to have a few words with youon behalf of my friend.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She would have come herself, but she's feelinga little unwell today.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Perhaps you'll be kind enough to forgive her andlisten to me instead.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
There's anyway nothing that she could have saidthat I won't.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the contrary, in fact, I think I can say even morethan her because I'm relatively impartial.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Would you not agree?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Whatis there to say, then?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"answered K., who was tired of Miss Montagcontinuously watching his lips.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
In that way she took control of what hewanted to say before he said it.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Miss BÃ¼rstner clearly refuses togrant me the personal meeting that I asked her for.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That's how itis,"" said Miss Montag, ""or rather, that's not at all how it is, the wayyou put it is remarkably severe.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Generally speaking, meetings areneither granted nor the opposite.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But it can be that meetings areconsidered unnecessary, and that's how it is here.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now, after yourcomment, I can speak openly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You asked my friend, verbally or inwriting, for the chance to speak with her.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now my friend is aware ofyour reasons for asking for this meeting - or at least I suppose she is- and so, for reasons I know nothing about, she is quite sure that itwould be of no benefit to anyone if this meeting actually took place.Moreover, it was only yesterday, and only very briefly, that she made itclear to me that such a meeting could be of no benefit for yourselfeither, she feels that it can only have been a matter of chance thatsuch an idea came to you, and that even without any explanations fromher, you will very soon come to realise yourself, if you have not doneso already, the futility of your idea.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"My answer to that is thatalthough it may be quite right, I consider it advantageous, if thematter is to be made perfectly clear, to give you an explicit answer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Ioffered my services in taking on the task, and after some hesitation myfriend conceded.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I hope, however, also to have acted in your interests,as even the slightest uncertainty in the least significant of matterswill always remain a cause of suffering and if, as in this case, it canbe removed without substantial effort, then it is better if that is donewithout delay.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I thank you,"" said K. as soon as Miss Montag hadfinished.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He stood slowly up, looked at her, then across the table,then out the window - the house opposite stood there in the sun - andwent to the door.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Miss Montag followed him a few paces, as if she didnot quite trust him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At the door, however, both of them had to stepback as it opened and Captain Lanz entered.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
This was the first timethat K. had seen him close up.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He was a large man of about forty with atanned, fleshy face.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He bowed slightly, intending it also for K., andthen went over to Miss Montag and deferentially kissed her hand.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He wasvery elegant in the way he moved.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The courtesy he showed towards MissMontag made a striking contrast with the way she had been treated by K.Nonetheless, Miss Montag did not seem to be cross with K. as it evenseemed to him that she wanted to introduce the captain.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. however, didnot want to be introduced, he would not have been able to show any sortof friendliness either to Miss Montag or to the captain, the kiss on thehand had, for K., bound them into a group which would keep him at adistance from Miss BÃ¼rstner whilst at the same time seeming to betotally harmless and unselfish.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. thought, however, that he saw morethan that, he thought he also saw that Miss Montag had chosen a means ofdoing it that was good, but two-edged.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She exaggerated the importanceof the relationship between K. and Miss BÃ¼rstner, and above all sheexaggerated the importance of asking to speak with her and she tried atthe same time to make out that K. was exaggerating everything.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Shewould be disappointed, K. did not want to exaggerate anything, he wasaware that Miss BÃ¼rstner was a little typist who would not offer himmuch resistance for long.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
In doing so he deliberately took no accountof what Mrs. Grubach had told him about Miss BÃ¼rstner.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
All these thingswere going through his mind as he left the room with hardly a politeword.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He wanted to go straight to his room, but a little laugh fromMiss Montag that he heard from the dining room behind him brought him tothe idea that he might prepare a  surprise for the two of them, thecaptain and Miss Montag.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He looked round and listened to find out ifthere might be any disturbance from any of the surrounding rooms,everywhere was quiet, the only thing to be heard was the conversationfrom the dining room and Mrs. Grubach's voice from the passage leadingto the kitchen.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This seemed an opportune time, K. went to MissBÃ¼rstner's room and knocked gently.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
There was no sound so he knockedagain but there was still no answer in reply.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Was she asleep?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Or wasshe really unwell?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Or was she just pretending as she realised it couldonly be K. knocking so gently?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. assumed she was pretending andknocked harder, eventually, when the knocking brought no result, hecarefully opened the door with the sense of doing something that was notonly improper but also pointless.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
In the room there was no-one.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"What'smore, it looked hardly at all like the room K. had known before.Against the wall there were now two beds behind one another, there wereclothes piled up on three chairs near the door, a wardrobe stood open.Miss BÃ¼rstner must have gone out while Miss Montag was speaking to himin the dining room.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. was not greatly bothered by this, he had hardlyexpected to be able to find Miss BÃ¼rstner so easily and had made thisattempt for little more reason than to spite Miss Montag.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But that madeit all the more embarrassing for him when, as he was closing the dooragain, he saw Miss Montag and the captain talking in the open doorway ofthe dining room.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They had probably been standing there ever since K.had opened the door, they avoided seeming to observe K. but chattedlightly and followed his movements with glances, the absent mindedglances to the side such as you make during a conversation.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But theseglances were heavy for K., and he rushed alongside the wall back intohis own room.Chapter FiveThe whip-man        One evening, a few days later, K. was walking along one of thecorridors that separated his office from the main stairway - he wasnearly the last one to leave for home that evening, there remained onlya couple of workers in the light of a single bulb in the dispatchdepartment - when he heard a sigh from behind a door which he hadhimself never opened but which he had always thought just led into ajunk room.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He stood in amazement and listened again to establishwhether he might not be mistaken.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"For a while there was silence, butthen came some more sighs.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"His first thought was to fetch one of theservitors, it might well have been worth having a witness present, butthen he was taken by an uncontrollable curiosity that make him simplyyank the door open.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was, as he had thought, a junk room.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Old,unusable forms, empty stone ink-bottles lay scattered behind theentrance.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But in the cupboard-like room itself stood three men,crouching under the low ceiling.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"""What are you doing here?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K. quietly, but crossly andwithout thinking.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"One of the men was clearly in charge, and attractedattention by being dressed in a kind of dark leather costume which lefthis neck and chest and his arms exposed.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He did not answer.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But theother two called out, ""Mr. K.!",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"We're to be beaten because you made acomplaint about us to the examining judge.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And now, K. finallyrealised that it was actually the two policemen, Franz and Willem, andthat the third man held a cane in his hand with which to beat them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Well,"" said K., staring at them, ""I didn't make any complaint, I onlysaid what took place in my home.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"And then, somethingdid indeed begin to move there in the corner.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
In the light of thecandle held up by K.'s uncle an elderly gentleman could be seen sittingbeside a small table.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
He had been sitting there for so long withoutbeing noticed that he could hardly have been breathing.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now he stood upwith a great deal of fuss, clearly unhappy that attention had been drawnto him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was as if, by flapping his hands about like short wings, hehoped to deflect any introductions and greetings, as if he wanted on noaccount to disturb the others by his presence and seemed to be exhortingthem to leave him back in the dark and forget about his being there.That, however, was something that could no longer be granted him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

A horrible sight!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. was able to quietly watch everything asnobody paid any attention to him, the office director took over asleader of the conversation as seemed to be his habit once he had beencalled forward, the lawyer listened attentively with his hand to hisear, his initial weakness having perhaps only had the function ofdriving away his new visitors, K.'s uncle served as candle-bearer -balancing the candle on his thigh while the office director frequentlyglanced nervously at it - and was soon free of his embarrassment and wasquickly enchanted not only by the office director's speaking manner butalso by the gentle, waving hand-movements with which he accompanied it.K., leaning against the bedpost, was totally ignored by the officedirector, perhaps deliberately, and served the old man only as audience.And besides, he had hardly any idea what the conversation was about andhis thoughts soon turned to the care assistant and the ill treatment shehad suffered from his uncle.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Soon after, he began to wonder whether hehad not seen the office director somewhere before, perhaps among thepeople who were at his first hearing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He may have been mistaken, butthought the office director might well have been among the old gentlemenwith the thin beards in the first row.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
There was then a noise that everyone heard from the hallway as ifsomething of porcelain were being broken.,Franz Kafka,The Trial

"He had hardly stepped into the hallway, finding hisbearings in the darkness with his hand still firmly holding the door,when another small hand, much smaller than K.'s own, placed itself onhis and gently shut the door.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"""This way,"" said the carer, pointing to a dark trunk with acarved, wooden backrest.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

It depicted a man wearing a judge'srobes; he was sitting on a lofty throne gilded in a way that shone forthfrom the picture.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The odd thing about the picture was that this judgewas not sitting there in dignified calm but had his left arm pressedagainst the back and armrest, his right arm, however, was completelyfree and only grasped the armrest with his hand, as if about to jump upany moment in vigorous outrage and make some decisive comment or even topass sentence.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"had no idea what actions the lawyer was taking; it was certainly nota lot, it was more than a month since the lawyer had summoned him, andnone of the previous discussions had given K. the impression that thisman would be able to do much for him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Most importantly, he had askedhim hardly any questions.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
And there were so many questions here to beasked.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Asking questions were the most important thing.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. had thefeeling that he would be able to ask all the questions needed herehimself.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The lawyer, in contrast, did not ask questions but did all thetalking himself or sat silently facing him, leant forward slightly overthe desk, probably because he was hard of hearing, pulled on a strand ofhair in the middle of his beard and looked down at the carpet, perhapsat the very spot where K. had lain with Leni.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Now and then he wouldgive K. some vague warning of the sort you give to children.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Hisspeeches were as pointless as they were boring, and K. decided that whenthe final bill came he would pay not a penny for them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Once the lawyerthought he had humiliated K. sufficiently, he usually started somethingthat would raise his spirits again.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had already, he would then say,won many such cases, partly or in whole, cases which may not really havebeen as difficult as this one but which, on the face of it, had evenless hope of success.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had a list of these cases here in the drawer -here he would tap on one or other of the drawers in his desk - butcould, unfortunately, not show them to K. as they dealt with officialsecrets.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nonetheless, the great experience he had acquired through allthese cases would, of course, be of benefit to K.  He had, of course,begun work straight away and was nearly ready to submit the firstdocuments.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
They would be very important because the first impressionmade by the defence will often determine the whole course of theproceedings.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Unfortunately, though, he would still have to make itclear to K. that the first documents submitted are sometimes not evenread by the court.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They simply put them with the other documents andpoint out that, for the time being, questioning and observing theaccused are much more important than anything written.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If the applicantbecomes insistent, then they add that before they come to any decision,as soon as all the material has been brought together, with due regard,of course, to all the documents, then these first documents to have beensubmitted will also be checked over.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But unfortunately, even this isnot usually true, the first documents submitted are usually mislaid orlost completely, and even if they do keep them right to the end they arehardly read, although the lawyer only knew about this from rumour.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thisis all very regrettable, but not entirely without its justifications.But K. should not forget that the trial would not be public, if thecourt deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no law thatsays it has to be.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As a result, the accused and his defence don't haveaccess even to the court records, and especially not to the indictment,and that means we generally don't know - or at least not precisely -what the first documents need to be about, which means that if they docontain anything of relevance to the case it's only by a luckycoincidence.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If anything about the individual charges and the reasonsfor them comes out clearly or can be guessed at while the accused isbeing questioned, then it's possible to work out and submit documentsthat really direct the issue and present proof, but not before.Conditions like this, of course, place the defence in a veryunfavourable and difficult position.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But that is what they intend.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Infact, defence is not really allowed under the law, it's only tolerated,and there is even some dispute about whether the relevant parts of thelaw imply even that.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"So strictly speaking, there is no such thing as acounsel acknowledged by the court, and anyone who comes before thiscourt as counsel is basically no more than a barrack room lawyer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Theeffect of all this, of course, is to remove the dignity of the wholeprocedure, the next time K. is in the court offices he might like tohave a look in at the lawyers' room, just so that he's seen it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Hemight well be quite shocked by the people he sees assembled there.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Theroom they've been allocated, with its narrow space and low ceiling, willbe enough to show what contempt the court has for these people.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Theonly light in the room comes through a little window that is so high upthat, if you want to look out of it, you first have to get one of yourcolleagues to support you on his back, and even then the smoke from thechimney just in front of it will go up your nose and make your faceblack.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In the floor of this room - to give yet another example of theconditions there - there is a hole that's been there for more than ayear, it's not so big that a man could fall through, but it is bigenough for your foot to disappear through it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The lawyers' room is onthe second floor of the attic; if your foot does go through it will hangdown into the first floor of the attic underneath it, and right in thecorridor where the litigants are waiting.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It's no exaggeration whenlawyers say that conditions like that are a disgrace.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Complaints to themanagement don't have the slightest effect, but the lawyers are strictlyforbidden to alter anything in the room at their own expense.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But eventreating the lawyers in this way has its reasons.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They want, as far aspossible, to prevent any kind of defence, everything should be made theresponsibility of the accused.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Not a bad point of view, basically, butnothing could be more mistaken than to think from that that lawyers arenot necessary for the accused in this court.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the contrary, there isno court where they are less needed than here.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
This is becauseproceedings are generally kept secret not only from the public but alsofrom the accused.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Only as far as that is possible, of course, but it ispossible to a very large extent.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And the accused doesn't get to see thecourt records either, and it's very difficult to infer what's in thecourt records from what's been said during questioning based on them,especially for the accused who is in a difficult situation and is facedwith every possible worry to distract him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
This is when the defencebegins.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Counsel for the defence are not normally allowed to be presentwhile the accused is being questioned, so afterwards, and if possiblestill at the door of the interview room, he has to learn what he canabout it from him and extract whatever he can that might be of use, eventhough what the accused has to report is often very confused.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But thatis not the most important thing, as there's really not a lot that can belearned in this way, although in this, as with anything else, acompetent man will learn more than another.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nonetheless, the mostimportant thing is the lawyer's personal connections, that's where thereal value of taking counsel lies.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now K. will most likely have alreadylearned from his own experience that, among its very lowest orders, thecourt organisation does have its imperfections, the court is strictlyclosed to the public, but staff who forget their duty or who take bribesdo, to some extent, show where the gaps are.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This is where most lawyerswill push their way in, this is where bribes are paid and informationextracted, there have even, in earlier times at least, been incidentswhere documents have been stolen.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There's no denying that somesurprisingly favourable results have been attained for the accused inthis way, for a limited time, and these petty advocates then strut toand fro on the basis of them and attract new clients, but for thefurther course of the proceedings it signifies either nothing or nothinggood.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The only things of real value are honest personal contacts,contacts with higher officials, albeit higher officials of the lowergrades, you understand.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That is the only way the progress of the trialcan be influenced, hardly noticeable at first, it's true, but from thenon it becomes more and more visible.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There are, of course, not manylawyers who can do this, and K. has made a very good choice in thismatter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There were probably no more than one or two who had as manycontacts as Dr. Huld, but they don't bother with the company of thelawyers' room and have nothing to do with it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
This means they have allthe less contact with the court officials.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It is not at all necessaryfor Dr. Huld to go to the court, wait in the ante-rooms for theexamining judges to turn up, if they turn up, and try to achievesomething which, according to the judges' mood is usually more apparentthan real and most often not even that.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"No, K. has seen for himselfthat the court officials, including some who are quite high up, comeforward without being asked, are glad to give information which is fullyopen or at least easy to understand, they discuss the next stages in theproceedings, in fact in some cases they can be won over and are quitewilling to adopt the other person's point of view.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"However, when thishappens, you should never trust them too far, as however firmly they mayhave declared this new point of view in favour of the defendant theymight well go straight back to their offices and write a report for thecourt that says just the opposite, and might well be even harder on thedefendant than the original view, the one they insist they've been fullydissuaded from.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And, of course, there's no way of defending yourselffrom this, something said in private is indeed in private and cannotthen be used in public, it's not something that makes it easy for thedefence to keep those gentlemen's favour.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the other hand, it's alsotrue that the gentlemen don't become involved with the defence - whichwill of course be done with great expertise - just for philanthropicreasons or in order to be friendly, in some respects it would be truerto say that they, too, have it allocated to them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This is where thedisadvantages of a court structure that, right from the start,stipulates that all proceedings take place in private, come into force.In normal, mediocre trials its officials have contact with the public,and they're very well equipped for it, but here they don't; normaltrials run their course all by themselves, almost, and just need a nudgehere and there; but when they're faced with cases that are especiallydifficult they're as lost as they often are with ones that are verysimple; they're forced to spend all their time, day and night, withtheir laws, and so they don't have the right feel for humanrelationships, and that's a serious shortcoming in cases like this.That's when they come for advice to the lawyer, with a servant behindthem carrying the documents which normally are kept so secret.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Youcould have seen many gentlemen at this window, gentlemen of whom youwould least expect it, staring out this window in despair on the streetbelow while the lawyer is at his desk studying the documents so that hecan give them good advice.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
And at times like that it's also possible tosee how exceptionally seriously these gentlemen take their professionsand how they are thrown into great confusion by difficulties which it'sjust not in their natures to overcome.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But they're not in an easyposition, to regard their positions as easy would be to do them aninjustice.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The different ranks and hierarchies of the court areendless, and even someone who knows his way around them cannot alwaystell what's going to happen.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But even for the junior officials, theproceedings in the courtrooms are usually kept secret, so they arehardly able to see how the cases they work with proceed, court affairsappear in their range of vision often without their knowing where theycome from and they move on further without their learning where they go.So civil servants like this are not able to learn the things you canlearn from studying the successive stages that individual trials gothrough, the final verdict or the reasons for it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They're only allowedto deal with that part of the trial which the law allocates them, andthey usually know less about the results of their work after it's leftthem than the defence does, even though the defence will usually stay incontact with the accused until the trial is nearly at its end, so thatthe court officials can learn many useful things from the defence.Bearing all this in mind, does it still surprise K. that the officialsare irritated and often express themselves about the litigants inunflattering ways - which is an experience shared by everyone.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All theofficials are irritated, even when they appear calm.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This causes manydifficulties for the junior advocates, of course.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There is a story, forinstance, that has very much the ring of truth about it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It goes likethis: One of the older officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealingwith a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused,especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had beenstudying it for a day and a night without a break - as these officialsare indeed hard working, no-one works as hard as they do.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When it wasnearly morning, and he had been working for twenty-four hours withprobably very little result, he went to the front entrance, waited therein ambush, and every time a lawyer tried to enter the building he wouldthrow him down the steps.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The lawyers gathered together down in frontof the steps and discussed with each other what they should do; on theone hand they had actually no right to be allowed into the building sothat there was hardly anything that they could legally do to theofficial and, as I've already mentioned, they would have to be carefulnot to set all the officials against them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the other hand, any daynot spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of someimportance to force their way inside.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In the end, they agreed that theywould try to tire the old man out.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"One lawyer after another was sentout to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again, offeringwhat resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance, and hiscolleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That went on forabout an hour until the old gentleman, who was already exhausted fromworking all night, was very tired and went back to his office.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thosewho were at the bottom of the steps could not believe it at first, sothey sent somebody out to go and look behind the door to see if therereally was no-one there, and only then did they all gather together andprobably didn't even dare to complain, as it's far from being thelawyers' job to introduce any improvements in the court system, or evento want to.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Even the most junior lawyer can understand the relationshipthere to some extent, but one significant point is that almost everydefendant, even very simple people, begins to think of suggestions forimproving the court as soon as his proceedings have begun, many of themoften even spend time and energy on the matter that could be spent farbetter elsewhere.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The only right thing to do is to learn how to dealwith the situation as it is.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Even if it were possible to improve anydetail of it - which is anyway no more than superstitious nonsense - thebest that they could achieve, although doing themselves incalculableharm in the process, is that they will have attracted the specialattention of the officials for any case that comes up in the future, andthe officials are always ready to seek revenge.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Never attract attentionto yourself!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Stay calm, however much it goes against your character!Try to gain some insight into the size of the court organism and how, tosome extent, it remains in a state of suspension, and that even if youalter something in one place you'll draw the ground out from under yourfeet and might fall, whereas if an enormous organism like the court isdisrupted in any one place it finds it easy to provide a substitute foritself somewhere else.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Everything is connected with everything else andwill continue without any change or else, which is quite probable, evenmore closed, more attentive, more strict, more malevolent.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
So it's bestto leave the work to the lawyers and not to keep disturbing them.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Itdoesn't do much good to make accusations, especially if you can't makeit clear what they're based on and their full significance, but it mustbe said that K. caused a great deal of harm to his own case by hisbehaviour towards the office director, he was a very influential man butnow he might as well be struck off the list of those who might doanything for K.  If the trial is mentioned, even just in passing,  it'squite obvious that he's ignoring it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
These officials are in many waysjust like children.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Often, something quite harmless - although K.'sbehaviour could unfortunately not be called harmless - will leave themfeeling so offended that they will even stop talking with good friendsof theirs, they turn away when they see them and do everything they canto oppose them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But then, with no particular reason, surprisinglyenough, some little joke that was only ever attempted because everythingseemed so hopeless will make them laugh and they'll be reconciled.It's both difficult and hard at the same time to deal with them, andthere's hardly any reason for it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It's sometimes quite astonishing thata single, average life is enough to encompass so much that it's at allpossible ever to have any success in one's work here.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the otherhand, there are also dark moments, such as everyone has, when you thinkyou've achieved nothing at all, when it seems that the only trials tocome to a good end are those that were determined to have a good endfrom the start and would do so without any help, while all the othersare lost despite all the running to and fro, all the effort, all thelittle, apparent successes that gave such joy.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then you no longer feelvery sure of anything and, if asked about a trial that was doing well byits own nature but which was turned for the worse because you assistedin it, would not even dare deny that.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And even that is a kind of self-confidence, but then it's the only one that's left.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Lawyers areespecially vulnerable to fits of depression of that sort - and they areno more than fits of depression of course - when a case is suddenlytaken out of their hands after they've been conducting it satisfactorilyfor some time.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That's probably the worst that can happen to a lawyer.It's not that the accused takes the case away from him, that hardly everhappens, once a defendant has taken on a certain lawyer he has to staywith him whatever happens.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
How could he ever carry on by himself afterhe's taken on help from a lawyer?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"No, that just doesn't happen, butwhat does sometimes happen is that the trial takes on a course where thelawyer may not go along with it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Client and trial are both simply takenaway from the lawyer; and then even contact with the court officialswon't help, however good they are, as they don't know anythingthemselves.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The trial will have entered a stage where no more help canbe given, where it's being processed in courts to which no-one has anyaccess, where the defendant cannot even be contacted by his lawyer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Youcome home one day and find all the documents you've submitted, whichyou've worked hard to create and which you had the best hopes for, lyingon the desk, they've been sent back as they can't be carried through tothe next stage in the trial, they're just worthless scraps of paper.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Itdoesn't mean that the case has been lost, not at all, or at least thereis no decisive reason for supposing so, it's just that you don't knowanything more about the case and won't be told anything of what'shappening.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Well, cases like that are the exceptions, I'm glad to say,and even if K.'s trial is one of them, it's still, for the time being, along way off.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But there was still plenty of opportunity for lawyers toget to work, and K. could be sure they would be made use of.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As he hadsaid, the time for submitting documents was still in the future andthere was no rush to prepare them, it was much more important to startthe initial discussions with the appropriate officials, and they hadalready taken place.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"With varying degrees of success, it must be said.It was much better not to give away any details before their time, as inthat way K. could only be influenced unfavourably and his hopes might beraised or he might be made too anxious, better just to say that someindividuals have spoken very favourably and shown themselves verywilling to help, although others have spoken less favourably, but eventhey have not in any way refused to help.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"So all in all, the resultsare very encouraging, only you should certainly not draw any particularconclusions as all preliminary proceedings begin in the same way and itwas only the way they developed further that would show what the valueof these preliminary proceedings has been.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Anyway, nothing has beenlost yet, and if we can succeed in getting the office director, despiteeverything, on our side - and several actions have been undertaken tothis end - then everything is a clean wound, as a surgeon would say, andwe can wait for the results with some comfort.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
When he started talking on in this way the lawyer was quitetireless.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He went through it all again every time K. went to see him.There was always some progress, but he could never be told what sort ofprogress it was.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The first set of documents to be submitted were beingworked on but still not ready, which usually turned out to be a greatadvantage the next time K. went to see him as the earlier occasion wouldhave been a very bad time to put them in, which they could not then haveknown.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If K., stupefied from all this talking, ever pointed out thateven considering all these difficulties progress was very slow, thelawyer would object that progress was not slow at all, but that theymight have progressed far further if K. had come to him at the righttime.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But he had come to him late and that lateness would bring stillfurther difficulties, and not only where time was concerned.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The onlywelcome interruption during these visits was always when Leni contrivedto bring the lawyer his tea while K. was there.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then she would standbehind K. - pretending to watch the lawyer as he bent greedily over hiscup, poured the tea in and drank - and secretly let K. hold her hand.There was always complete silence.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The lawyer drank.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. squeezedLeni's hand and Leni would sometimes dare to gently stroke K.'s hair.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Still here, are you?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
the lawyer would ask when he was ready.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Iwanted to take the dishes away,"" said Leni, they would give each other'shands a final squeeze, the lawyer would wipe his mouth and then starttalking at K. again with renewed energy.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Was the lawyer trying to comfort K. or to confuse him?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. couldnot tell, but it seemed clear to him that his defence was not in goodhands.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Maybe everything the lawyer said was quite right, even though heobviously wanted to make himself as conspicuous as possible and probablyhad never even taken on a case as important as he said K.'s was.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But itwas still suspicious how he continually mentioned his personal contactswith the civil servants.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Were they to be exploited solely for K.'sbenefit?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The lawyer never forgot to mention that they were dealing onlywith junior officials, which meant officials who were dependent onothers, and the direction taken in each trial could be important fortheir own furtherment.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Could it be that they were making use of thelawyer to turn trials in a certain direction, which would, of course,always be at the cost of the defendant?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It certainly did not mean thatthey would do that in every trial, that was not likely at all, and therewere probably also trials where they gave the lawyer advantages and allthe room he needed to turn it in the direction he wanted, as it wouldalso be to their advantage to keep his reputation intact.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If thatreally was their relationship, how would they direct K.'s trial which,as the lawyer had explained, was especially difficult and thereforeimportant enough to attract great attention from the very first time itcame to court?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There could not be much doubt about what they would do.The first signs of it could already be seen in the fact that the firstdocuments still had not been submitted even though the trial had alreadylasted several months, and that, according to the lawyer, everything wasstill in its initial stages, which was very effective, of course, inmaking the defendant passive and keeping him helpless.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then he could besuddenly surprised with the verdict, or at least with a notificationthat the hearing had not decided in his favour and the matter would bepassed on to a higher office.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was essential that K. take a hand in it himself.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On winter'smornings such as this, when he was very tired and everything draggeditself lethargically through his head, this belief of his seemedirrefutable.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He no longer felt the contempt for the trial that he hadhad earlier.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If he had been alone in the world it would have been easyfor him to ignore it, although it was also certain that, in that case,the trial would never have arisen in the first place.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But now, hisuncle had already dragged him to see the lawyer, he had to take accountof his family; his job was no longer totally separate from the progressof the trial, he himself had carelessly - with a certain, inexplicablecomplacency - mentioned it to acquaintances and others had learned aboutit in ways he did not know, his relationship with Miss BÃ¼rstner seemedto be in trouble because of it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In short, he no longer had any choicewhether he would accept the trial or turn it down, he was in the middleof it and had to defend himself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If he was tired, then that was bad.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But there was no reason to worry too much before he needed to.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Hehad been capable of working himself up to his high position in the bankin a relatively short time and to retain it with respect from everyone,now he simply had to apply some of the talents that had made thatpossible for him to the trial, and there was no doubt that it had toturn out well.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The most important thing, if something was to beachieved, was to reject in advance any idea that he might be in any wayguilty.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
There was no guilt.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The trial was nothing but a big piece ofbusiness, just like he had already concluded to the benefit of the bankmany times, a piece of business that concealed many lurking dangerswaiting in ambush for him, as they usually did, and these dangers wouldneed to be defended against.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If that was to be achieved then he mustnot entertain any idea of guilt, whatever he did, he would need to lookafter his own interests as closely as he could.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Seen in this way, therewas no choice but to take his representation away from the lawyer verysoon, at best that very evening.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The lawyer had told him, as he talkedto him, that that was something unheard of and would probably do him agreat deal of harm, but K. could not tolerate any impediment to hisefforts where his trial was concerned, and these impediments wereprobably caused by the lawyer himself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But once he had shaken off thelawyer the documents would need to be submitted straight away and, ifpossible, he would need to see to it that they were being dealt withevery day.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It would of course not be enough, if that was to be done,for K. to sit in the corridor with his hat under the bench like theothers.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Day after day, he himself, or one of the women or somebody elseon his behalf, would have to run after the officials and force them tosit at their desks and study K.'s documents instead of looking out onthe corridor through the grating.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There could be no let-up in theseefforts, everything would need to be organised and supervised, it wasabout time that the court came up against a defendant who knew how todefend and make use of his rights.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But when K. had the confidence to try and do all this thedifficulty of composing the documents was too much for him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Earlier,just a week or so before, he could only have felt shame at the thoughtof being made to write out such documents himself;  it had never enteredhis head that the task could also be difficult.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He remembered onemorning when, already piled up with work, he suddenly shoved everythingto one side and took a pad of paper on which he sketched out some of histhoughts on how documents of this sort should proceed.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Perhaps he wouldoffer them to that slow-witted lawyer, but just then the door of themanager's office opened and the deputy-director entered the room with aloud laugh.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. was very embarrassed, although the deputy-director, ofcourse, was not laughing at K.'s documents, which he knew nothing about,but at a joke he had just heard about the stock-exchange, a joke whichneeded an illustration if it was to be understood, and now the deputy-director leant over K.'s desk, took his pencil from his hand, and drewthe illustration on the writing pad that K. had intended for his ideasabout his case.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. now had no more thoughts of shame, the documents had to beprepared and submitted.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If, as was very likely, he could find no timeto do it in the office he would have to do it at home at night.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If thenights weren't enough he would have to take a holiday.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Above all, he couldnot stop half way, that was nonsense not only in business but always andeverywhere.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Needless to say, the documents would mean an almost endlessamount of work.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was easy to come to the belief, not only for thoseof an anxious disposition, that it was impossible ever to finish it.This was not because of laziness or deceit, which were the only thingsthat might have hindered the lawyer in preparing it, but because he didnot know what the charge was or even what consequences it might bring,so that he had to remember every tiny action and event from the whole ofhis life, looking at them from all sides and checking and reconsideringthem.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was also a very disheartening job.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
It would have been moresuitable as a way of passing the long days after he had retired andbecome senile.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But now, just when K. needed to apply all his thoughtsto his work, when he was still rising and already posed a threat to thedeputy-director, when every hour passed so quickly and he wanted toenjoy the brief evenings and nights as a young man, this was the time hehad to start working out these documents.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Once more, he began to feelresentment.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Almost involuntarily, only to put an end to it, his fingerfelt for the button of the electric bell in the ante-room.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
As hepressed it he glanced up to the clock.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was eleven o'clock, twohours, he had spent a great deal of his costly time just dreaming andhis wits were, of course, even more dulled than they had been before.But the time had, nonetheless, not been wasted, he had come to somedecisions that could be of value.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As well as various pieces of mail,the servitors brought two visiting cards from gentlemen who had alreadybeen waiting for K. for some time.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
They were actually very importantclients of the bank who should not really have been kept waiting underany circumstances.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Why had they come at such an awkward time, and why,the gentlemen on the other side of the closed door seemed to be asking,was the industrious K. using up the best business time for his privateaffairs?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Tired from what had gone before, and tired in anticipation ofwhat was to follow, K. stood up to receive the first of them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He was a short, jolly man, a manufacturer who K. knew well.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Heapologised for disturbing K. at some important work, and K., for hispart, apologised for having kept the manufacturer waiting for so long.But even this apology was spoken in such a mechanical way and with suchfalse intonation that the manufacturer would certainly have noticed ifhe had not been fully preoccupied with his business affairs.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Instead,he hurriedly pulled calculations and tables out from all his pockets,spread them out in front of K., explained several items, corrected alittle mistake in the arithmetic that he noticed as he quickly glancedover it all, and reminded K. of a similar piece of business he'dconcluded with him about a year before, mentioning in passing that thistime there was another bank  spending great effort to get his business,and finally stopped speaking in order to learn K.'s opinion on thematter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And K. had indeed, at first, been closely following what themanufacturer was saying, he too was aware of how important the deal was,but unfortunately it did not last, he soon stopped listening, nodded ateach of the manufacturer's louder exclamations for a short while, buteventually he stopped doing even that and did no more than stare at thebald head bent over the papers, asking himself when the manufacturerwould finally realise that everything he was saying was useless.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Whenhe did stop talking, K. really thought at first that this was so that hewould have the chance to confess that he was incapable of listening.Instead, seeing the anticipation on the manufacturer's face, obviouslyready to counter any objections made, he was sorry to realise that thebusiness discussion had to be continued.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"So he bent his head as if he'dbeen given an order and began slowly to move his pencil over the papers,now and then he would stop and stare at one of the figures.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Themanufacturer thought there must be some objection, perhaps his figuresweren't really sound, perhaps they weren't the decisive issue, whateverhe thought, the manufacturer covered the papers with his hand and beganonce again, moving very close to K., to explain what the deal was allabout.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It is difficult,"" said K., pursing his lips.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The only thingthat could offer him any guidance were the papers, and the manufacturerhad covered them from his view, so he just sank back against the arm ofthe chair.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Even when the door of the manager's office opened andrevealed not very clearly, as if through a veil, the deputy director, hedid no more than look up weakly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. thought no more about the matter,he merely watched the immediate effect of the deputy director'sappearance and, for him, the effect was very pleasing;  the manufacturerimmediately jumped up from his seat and hurried over to meet the deputydirector, although K. would have liked to make him ten times livelier ashe feared the deputy director might disappear again.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He need not haveworried, the two gentlemen met each other, shook each other's hand andwent together over to K.'s desk.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The manufacturer said he was sorry tofind the chief clerk so little inclined to do business, pointing to K.who, under the view of the deputy director, had bent back down over thepapers.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As the two men leant over the desk and the manufacturer madesome effort to gain and keep the deputy director's attention, K. felt asif they were much bigger than they really were and that theirnegotiations were about him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Carefully and slowly turning his eyesupwards, he tried to learn what was taking place above him, took one ofthe papers from his desk without looking to see what it was, lay it onthe flat of his hand and raised it slowly up as he rose up to the levelof the two men himself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had no particular plan in mind as he didthis, but merely felt this was how he would act if only he had finishedpreparing that great document that was to remove his burden entirely.The deputy director had been paying all his attention to theconversation and did no more than glance at the paper, he did not readwhat was written on it at all as what was important for the chief clerkwas not important for him, he took it from K.'s hand saying, ""Thank you,I'm already familiar with everything"", and lay it calmly back on thedesk.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. gave him a bitter, sideways look.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But the deputy director didnot notice this at all, or if he did notice it it only raised hisspirits, he frequently laughed out loud, one time he clearly embarrassedthe manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew himimmediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely onhimself, and finally invited him into his office where they could bringthe matter to its conclusion.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's a very important matter,"" said themanufacturer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I understand that completely.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And I'm sure the chiefclerk ..."" - even as he said this he was actually speaking only to themanufacturer - ""will be very glad to have us take it off his hands.This is something that needs calm consideration.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But he seems to beover-burdened today, there are even some people in the room outsidewho've been waiting there for hours for him.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. still had enoughcontrol of himself to turn away from the deputy director and direct hisfriendly, albeit stiff, smile only at the manufacturer, he made no otherretaliation, bent down slightly and supported himself with both hands onhis desk like a clerk, and watched as the two gentlemen, still talking,took the papers from his desk and disappeared into the manager's office.In the doorway, the manufacturer turned and said he wouldn't make hisfarewell with K. just yet, he would of course let the chief clerk knowabout the success of his discussions but he also had a little somethingto tell him about.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At last, K. was by himself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It did not enter his head to showanyone else into his office and only became vaguely aware of how nice itwas that the people outside thought he was still negotiating with themanufacturer and, for this reason, he could not let anyone in to seehim, not even the servitor.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He went over to the window, sat down on theledge beside it, held firmly on to the handle and looked down onto thesquare outside.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The snow was still falling, the weather still had notbrightened up at all.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He remained a long time sitting in this way, not knowing what itactually was that made him so anxious, only occasionally did he glance,slightly startled, over his shoulder at the door to the outer roomwhere, mistakenly, he thought he'd heard some noise.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"No-one came, andthat made him feel calmer, he went over to the wash stand, rinsed hisface with cold water and, his head somewhat clearer, went back to hisplace by the window.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The decision to take his defence into his ownhands now seemed more of a burden than he had originally assumed.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Allthe while he had left his defence up to the lawyer his trial had hadlittle basic affect on him, he had observed it from afar as somethingthat was scarcely able to reach him directly, when it suited him helooked to see how things stood but he was also able to draw his headback again whenever he wanted.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now, in contrast, if he was to conducthis defence himself, he would have to devote himself entirely to thecourt - for the time being, at least - success would mean, later on, hiscomplete and conclusive liberation, but if he was to achieve this hewould have to place himself, to start with, in far greater danger thanhe had been in so far.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If he ever felt tempted to doubt this, then hisexperience with the deputy director and the manufacturer that day wouldbe quite enough to convince him of it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
How could he have sat theretotally convinced of the need to do his own defence?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
How would it belater?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
What would his life be like in the days ahead?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Would he findthe way through it all to a happy conclusion?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Did a carefully workedout defence - and any other sort would have made no sense - did acarefully worked out defence not also mean he would need to shut himselfoff from everything else as much as he could?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Would he survive that?And how was he to succeed in conducting all this at the bank?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Itinvolved much more than just submitting some documents that he couldprobably prepare in a few days' leave, although it would have been greattemerity to ask for time off from the bank just at that time, it was awhole trial and there was no way of seeing how long it might last.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Thiswas an enormous difficulty that had suddenly been thrown into K.'s life!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
And was he supposed to be doing the bank's work at a time likethis?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
He looked down at his desk.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Was he supposed to let people in tosee him and go into negotiations with them at a time like this?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Whilehis trial trundled on, while the court officials upstairs in the atticroom sat looking at the papers for this trial, should he be worryingabout the business of the bank?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Did this not seem like a kind oftorture, acknowledged by the court, connected with the trial and whichfollowed him around?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And is it likely that anyone in the bank, whenjudging his work, would take any account of his peculiar situation?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
No-one and never.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There were those who knew about his trial, although itwas not quite clear who knew about it or how much.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But he hoped rumourshad not reached as far as the deputy director, otherwise he wouldobviously soon find a way of making use of it to harm K., he would showneither comradeship nor humaneness.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
And what about the director?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Itwas true that he was well disposed towards K., and as soon as he heardabout the trial he would probably try to do everything he could to makeit easier for him, but he would certainly not devote himself to it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K.at one time had provided the counter-balance to what the deputy directorsaid but the director was now coming more and more under his influence,and the deputy director would also exploit the weakened condition of thedirector to strengthen his own power.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
So what could K. hope for?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Maybeconsiderations of this sort weakened his power of resistance, but it wasstill necessary not to deceive oneself and to see everything as clearlyas it could be seen at that moment.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"For no particular reason, just to avoiding returning to his deskfor a while, he opened the window.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was difficult to open and he hadto turn the handle with both his hands.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then, through the whole heightand breadth of the window, the mixture of fog and smoke was drawn intothe room, filling it with a slight smell of burning.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
A few flakes ofsnow were blown in with it.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's a horrible autumn,"" said themanufacturer, who had come into the room unnoticed after seeing thedeputy director and now stood behind K.  K. nodded and looked uneasilyat the manufacturer's briefcase, from which he would now probably takethe papers and inform K. of the result of his negotiations with thedeputy director.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"However, the manufacturer saw where K. was looking,knocked on his briefcase and without opening it said, ""You'll be wantingto hear how things turned out.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I've already got the contract in mypocket, almost.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He's a charming man, your deputy director - he's gothis dangers, though.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He laughed as he shook K.'s hand and wanted tomake him laugh with him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But to K., it once more seemed suspicious thatthe manufacturer did not want to show him the papers and saw nothingabout his comments to laugh at.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Chief clerk,"" said the manufacturer,""I expect the weather's been affecting your mood, has it?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You're lookingso worried today.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said K., raising his hand and holding thetemple of his head, ""headaches, worries in the family.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Quite right,""said the manufacturer, who was always in a hurry and could never listento anyone for very long, ""everyone has his cross to bear.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. hadunconsciously made a step towards the door as if wanting to show themanufacturer out, but the manufacturer said, ""Chief clerk, there'ssomething else I'd like to mention to you.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I'm very sorry if it'ssomething that'll be a burden to you today of all days but I've been tosee you twice already, lately, and each time I forgot all about it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
IfI delay it any longer it might well lose its point altogether.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thatwould be a pity, as I think what I've got to say does have some value.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Before K. had had the time to answer, the manufacturer came up close tohim, tapped his knuckle lightly on his chest and said quietly, ""You'vegot a trial going on, haven't you?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. stepped back and immediatelyexclaimed, ""That's what the deputy director's been telling you!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No,no,"" said the manufacturer, ""how would the deputy director know aboutit?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""And what about you?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K., already more in control ofhimself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I hear things about the court here and there,"" said themanufacturer, ""and that even applies to what it is that I wanted to tellyou about.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""There are so many people who have connections with thecourt!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"said K. with lowered head, and he led the manufacturer over tohis desk.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They sat down where they had been before, and themanufacturer said, ""I'm afraid it's not very much that I've got to tellyou about.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Only, in matters like this, it's best not to overlook thetiniest details.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Besides, I really want to help you in some way,however modest my help might be.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"We've been good business partners uptill now, haven't we?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Well then.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. wanted to apologise for hisbehaviour in the conversation earlier that day, but the manufacturerwould tolerate no interruption, shoved his briefcase up high in hisarmpit to show that he was in a hurry, and carried on.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I know aboutyour case through a certain Titorelli.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He's a painter, Titorelli's justhis artistic name, I don't even know what his real name is.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He's beencoming to me in my office for years from time to time, and brings littlepictures with him which I buy more or less just for the sake of charityas he's hardly more than a beggar.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And they're nice pictures, too,moorland landscapes and that sort of thing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
We'd both got used to doingbusiness in this way and it always went smoothly.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Only, one time thesevisits became a bit too frequent, I began to tell him off for it, westarted talking and I became interested how it was that he could earn aliving just by painting, and then I learned to my amazement that hismain source of income was painting portraits.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"'I work for the court,'he said, 'what court?'",Franz Kafka,The Trial
said I.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
And that's when he told me about thecourt.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
I'm sure you can imagine how amazed I was at being told allthis.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Ever since then I learn something new about the court every timehe comes to visit, and so little by little I get to understand somethingof how it works.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Anyway, Titorelli talks a lot and I often have to pushhim away, not only because he's bound to be lying but also, most of all,because a businessman like me who's already close to breaking pointunder the weight of his own business worries can't pay too muchattention to other people's.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But all that's just by the by.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Perhaps -this is what I've been thinking - perhaps Titorelli might be able tohelp you in some small way, he knows lots of judges and even if he can'thave much influence himself he can give you some advice about how to getsome influential people on your side.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
And even if this advice doesn'tturn out to make all the difference I still think it'll be veryimportant once you've got it.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
You're nearly a lawyer yourself.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That'swhat I always say, Mr. K. the chief clerk is nearly a lawyer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Oh I'msure this trial of yours will turn out all right.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"So do you want to goand see Titorelli, then?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If I ask him to he'll certainly do everythinghe possibly can.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
I really do think you ought to go.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It needn't betoday, of course, just some time, when you get the chance.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And anyway -I want to tell you this too -  you don't actually have to go and seeTitorelli, this advice from me doesn't place you under any obligation atall.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"No, if you think you can get by without Titorelli it'll certainlybe better to leave him completely out of it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Maybe you've already got aclear idea of what you're doing and Titorelli could upset your plans.No, if that's the case then of course you shouldn't go there under anycircumstances!",Franz Kafka,The Trial
And it certainly won't be easy to take advice from a ladlike that.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Still, it's up to you.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Here's the letter of recommendationand here's the address.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Disappointed, K. took the letter and put it in his pocket.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Evenat best, the advantage he might derive from this recommendation wasincomparably smaller than the damage that lay in the fact of themanufacturer knowing about his trial, and that the painter was spreadingthe news about.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was all he could manage to give the manufacturer, whowas already on his way to the door, a few words of thanks.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'll gothere,"" he said as he took his leave of the manufacturer at the door,""or, as I'm very busy at present, I'll write to him, perhaps he wouldlike to come to me in my office some time.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I was sure you'd find thebest solution,"" said the manufacturer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Although I had thought you'dprefer to avoid inviting people like this Titorelli to the bank andtalking about the trial here.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And it's not always a good idea to sendletters to people like Titorelli, you don't know what might happen tothem.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But you're bound to have thought everything through and you knowwhat you can and can't do.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. nodded and accompanied the manufactureron through the ante-room.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But despite seeming calm on the outside hewas actually very shocked; he had told the manufacturer he would writeto Titorelli only to show him in some way that he valued hisrecommendations and would consider the opportunity to speak withTitorelli without delay, but if he had thought Titorelli could offer anyworthwhile assistance he would not have delayed.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But it was only themanufacturer's comment that made K. realise what dangers that could leadto.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Was he really able to rely on his own understanding so little?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Ifit was possible that he might invite a questionable character into thebank with a clear letter, and ask advice from him about his trial,separated from the deputy director by no more than a door, was it notpossible or even very likely that there were also other dangers he hadfailed to see or that he was even running towards?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
There was not alwayssomeone beside him to warn him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And just now, just when he would haveto act with all the strength he could muster, now a number of doubts ofa sort he had never before known had presented themselves and affectedhis own vigilance!",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The difficulties he had been feeling in carrying outhis office work; were they now going to affect the trial too?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now, atleast, he found himself quite unable to understand how he could haveintended to write to Titorelli and invite him into the bank.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He shook his head at the thought of it once more as the servitorcame up beside him and drew his attention to the three gentlemen whowere waiting on a bench in the ante-room.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
They had already been waitingto see K. for a long time.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Now that the servitor was speaking with K.they had stood up and each of them wanted to make use of the opportunityto see K. before the others.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It had been negligent of the bank to letthem waste their time here in the waiting room, but none of them wantedto draw attention to this.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Mr. K., ..."" one of them was saying, but K.had told the servitor to fetch his winter coat and said to the three ofthem, as the servitor helped him to put it on, ""Please forgive me,gentlemen, I'm afraid I have no time to see you at present.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Please doforgive me but I have some urgent business to settle and have to leavestraight away.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
You've already seen yourselves how long I've beendelayed.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Would you be so kind as to come back tomorrow or some time?Or perhaps we could settle your affairs by telephone?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Or perhaps youwould like to tell me now, briefly, what it's about and I can then giveyou a full answer in writing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Whatever, the best thing will be for youto come here again.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The gentlemen now saw that their wait had beentotally pointless, and these suggestions of K.'s left them so astoundedthat they looked at each other without a word.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That's agreed then, isit?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K., who had turned toward the servitor bringing him his hat.Through the open door of K.'s office they could see that the snowfalloutside had become much heavier.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
So K. turned the collar of his coat upand buttoned it up high under his chin.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Just then the deputy directorcame out of the adjoining room, smiled as he saw K. negotiating with thegentlemen in his winter coat, and asked, ""Are you about to go out?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""Yes,"" said K., standing more upright, ""I have to go out on somebusiness.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But the deputy director had already turned towards thegentlemen.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""And what about these gentlemen?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
he asked.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I thinkthey've already been waiting quite a long time.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""We've already come toan understanding,"" said K.  But now the gentlemen could be held back nolonger, they surrounded K. and explained that they would not have beenwaiting for hours if it had not been about something important that hadto be discussed now, at length and in private.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The deputy directorlistened to them for a short while, he also looked at K. as he held hishat in his hand cleaning the dust off it here and there, and then hesaid, ""Gentlemen, there is a very simple way to solve this.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If youwould prefer it, I'll be very glad to take over these negotiationsinstead of the chief clerk.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Your business does, of course, need to bediscussed without delay.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
We are businessmen like yourselves and knowthe value of a businessman's time.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Would you like to come this way?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""And he opened the door leading to the ante-room of his own office.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The deputy director seemed very good at appropriating everythingthat K. was now forced to give up!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
But was K. not giving up more thanhe absolutely had to?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"By running off to some unknown painter, with, ashe had to admit, very little hope of any vague benefit, his renown wassuffering damage that could not be repaired.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It would probably be muchbetter to take off his winter coat again and, at the very least, try towin back the two gentlemen who were certainly still waiting in the nextroom.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If K. had not then glimpsed the deputy director in his office,looking for something from his bookshelves as if they were his own, hewould probably even have made the attempt.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As K., somewhat agitated,approached the door the deputy director called out, ""Oh, you've stillnot left!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He turned his face toward him - its many deep folds seemedto show strength rather than age - and immediately began once more tosearch.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'm looking for a copy of a contract,"" he said, ""which thisgentleman  insists you must have.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Could you help me look for it, do youthink?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. made a step forward, but the deputy director said, ""thankyou, I've already found it,"" and with a big package of papers, whichcertainly must have included many more documents than just the copy ofthe contract, he turned and went back into his own office.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I can't deal with him right now,"" K. said to himself, ""but oncemy personal difficulties have been settled, then he'll certainly be thefirst to get the effect of it, and he certainly won't like it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Slightly calmed by these thoughts, K. gave the servitor, who had alreadylong been holding the door to the corridor open for him, the task oftelling the director, when he was able, that K. was going out of thebank on a business matter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
As he left the bank he felt almost happy atthe thought of being able to devote more of himself to his own businessfor a while.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He went straight to the painter, who lived in an outlying part oftown which was very near to the court offices, although this area waseven poorer, the houses were darker, the streets were full of dirt thatslowly blew about over the half-melted snow.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In the great gateway tothe building where the painter lived only one of the two doors was open,a hole had been broken open in the wall by the other door, and as K.approached it a repulsive, yellow, steaming liquid shot out causing somerats to scurry away into the nearby canal.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Down by the staircase therewas a small child lying on its belly crying, but it could hardly beheard because of the noise from a metal-workshop on the other side ofthe entrance hall, drowning out any other sound.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The door to theworkshop was open, three workers stood in a circle around some piece ofwork that they were beating with hammers.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"A large tin plate hung on thewall, casting a pale light that pushed its way in between two of theworkers, lighting up their faces and their work-aprons.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. did no morethan glance at any of these things, he wanted to get things over withhere as soon as possible, to exchange just a few words to find out howthings stood with the painter and go straight back to the bank.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Even ifhe had just some tiny success here it would still have a good effect onhis work at the bank for that day.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the third floor he had to slowdown his pace, he was quite out of breath - the steps, just like theheight of each floor, were much higher than they needed to be and he'dbeen told that the painter lived right up in the attic.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The air wasalso quite oppressive, there was no proper stairwell and the narrowsteps were closed in by walls on both sides with no more than a small,high window here and there.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Just as K. paused for a while some younggirls ran out of one of the flats and rushed higher up the stairs,laughing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. followed them slowly, caught up with one of the girls whohad stumbled and been left behind by the others, and asked her as theywent up side by side, ""Is there a painter, Titorelli, who lives here?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""The girl, hardly thirteen years old and somewhat hunchbacked, jabbed himwith her elbow and looked at him sideways.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Her youth and her bodilydefects had done nothing to stop her being already quite depraved.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Shedid not smile once, but looked at K. earnestly, with sharp, acquisitiveeyes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. pretended not to notice her behaviour and asked, ""Do you knowTitorelli, the painter?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She nodded and asked in reply,  ""What d'youwant to see him for?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. thought it would be to his advantage quicklyto find out something more about Titorelli.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I want to have him paintmy portrait,"" he said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Paint your portrait?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"she asked, opening hermouth too wide and lightly hitting K. with her hand as if he had saidsomething extraordinarily surprising or clumsy, with both hands shelifted her skirt, which was already very short, and, as fast as shecould, she ran off after the other girls whose indistinct shouts lostthemselves in the heights.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At the next turn of the stairs, however, K.encountered all the girls once more.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The hunchbacked girl had clearlytold them about K.'s intentions and they were waiting for him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Theystood on both sides of the stairs, pressing themselves against the wallso that K. could get through between them, and smoothed their apronsdown with their hands.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All their faces, even in this guard of honour,showed a mixture of childishness and depravity.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Up at the head of theline of girls, who now, laughing, began to close in around K., was thehunchback who had taken on the role of leader.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was thanks to herthat K. found the right direction without delay - he would havecontinued up the stairs straight in front of him, but she showed himthat to reach Titorelli he would need to turn off to one side.The steps that led up to the painter were especially narrow, very longwithout any turning, the whole length could be seen in one glance and,at the top, at Titorelli's closed door, it came to its end.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This doorwas much better illuminated than the rest of the stairway by the lightfrom a small skylight set obliquely above it, it had been put togetherfrom unpainted planks of wood and the name 'Titorelli' was painted on itin broad, red brushstrokes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. was no more than half way up the steps,accompanied by his retinue of girls, when, clearly the result of thenoise of all those footsteps, the door opened slightly and in the cracka man who seemed to be dressed in just his nightshirt appeared.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Oh!",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""he cried, when he saw the approaching crowd, and vanished.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Thehunchbacked girl clapped her hands in glee and the other girls crowdedin behind K. to push him faster forward.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They still had not arrived at the top, however, when the painterup above them suddenly pulled the door wide open and, with a deep bow,invited K. to enter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The girls, on the other hand, he tried to keepaway, he did not want to let any of them in however much they begged himand however much they tried to get in - if they could not get in withhis permission they would try to force their way in against his will.The only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through underhis outstretched arm, but the painter chased after her, grabbed her bythe skirt, span her once round and set her down again by the door withthe other girls who, unlike the first, had not dared to cross thedoorstep while the painter had left his post.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. did not know what hewas to make of all this, as they all seemed to be having fun.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Onebehind the other, the girls by the door stretched their necks up highand called out various words to the painter which were meant in jest butwhich K. did not understand, and even the painter laughed as thehunchback whirled round in his hand.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then he shut the door, bowed oncemore to K., offered him his hand and introduced himself, saying,""Titorelli, painter"".",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. pointed to the door, behind which the girlswere whispering, and said, ""You seem to be very popular in thisbuilding.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Ach, those brats!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"said the painter, trying in vain tofasten his nightshirt at the neck.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He was also bare-footed and, apartfrom that, was wearing nothing more than a loose pair of yellowish linentrousers held up with a belt whose free end whipped to and fro.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Thosekids are a real burden for me,"" he continued.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The top button of hisnightshirt came off and he gave up trying to fasten it, fetched a chairfor K. and made him sit down on it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I painted one of them once - she'snot here today - and ever since then they've been following me about.If I'm here they only come in when I allow it, but as soon as I've goneout there's always at least one of them in here.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
They had a key made tomy door and lend it round to each other.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
It's hard to imagine what apain that is.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Suppose I come back home with a lady I'm going to paint,I open the door with my own key and find the hunchback there orsomething, by the table painting her lips red with my paintbrush, andmeanwhile her little sisters will be keeping guard for her, moving aboutand causing chaos in every corner of the room.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Or else, like happenedyesterday, I might come back home late in the evening - please forgivemy appearance and the room being in a mess, it is to do with them - so,I might come home late in the evening and want to go to bed, then I feelsomething pinching my leg, look under the bed and pull another of themout from under it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I don't know why it is they bother me like this, Iexpect you've just seen that I do nothing to encourage them to come nearme.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And they make it hard for me to do my work too, of course.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If Ididn't get this studio for nothing I'd have moved out a long time ago.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Just then, a little voice, tender and anxious, called out from under thedoor, ""Titorelli, can we come in now?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No,"" answered the painter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Not even just me, by myself?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
the voice asked again.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Not even justyou,"" said the painter, as he went to the door and locked it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Meanwhile, K. had been looking round the room, if it had not beenpointed out it would never have occurred to him that this wretchedlittle room could be called a studio.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was hardly long enough orbroad enough to make two steps.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Everything, floor, walls and ceiling,was made of wood, between the planks narrow gaps could be seen.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Acrossfrom where K. was, the bed stood against the wall under a covering ofmany different colours.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In the middle of the room a picture stood on aneasel, covered over with a shirt whose arms dangled down to the ground.Behind K. was the window through which the fog made it impossible to seefurther than the snow covered roof of the neighbouring building.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The turning of the key in the lock reminded K. that he had notwanted to stay too long.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"So he drew the manufacturer's letter out fromhis pocket, held it out to the painter and said, ""I learned about youfrom this gentleman, an acquaintance of yours, and it's on  his advicethat I've come here"".",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The painter glanced through the letter and threwit down onto the bed.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If the manufacturer had not said very clearlythat Titorelli was an acquaintance of his, a poor man who was dependenton his charity, then it would really have been quite possible to believethat Titorelli did not know him or at least that he could not rememberhim.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This impression was augmented by the painter's asking, ""Were youwanting to buy some pictures or did you want to have yourself painted?""K.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
looked at the painter in astonishment.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
What did the letter actuallysay?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. had taken it as a matter of course that the manufacturer hadexplained to the painter in his letter that K. wanted nothing more withhim than to find out more about his trial.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
He had been far too rash incoming here!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But now he had to give the painter some sort of answerand, glancing at the easel, said, ""Are you working on a picturecurrently?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said the painter, and he took the shirt hanging overthe easel and threw it onto the bed after the letter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's a portrait.Quite a good piece of work, although it's not quite finished yet.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thiswas a convenient coincidence for K., it gave him a good opportunity totalk about the court as the picture showed, very clearly, a judge.What's more, it was remarkably similar to the picture in the lawyer'soffice, although this one showed a quite different judge, a heavy manwith a full beard which was black and bushy and extended to the sidesfar up the man's cheeks.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The lawyer's picture was also an oil painting,whereas this one had been made with pastel colours and was pale andunclear.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But everything else about the picture was similar, as thisjudge, too, was holding tightly to the arm of his throne and seemedominously about to rise from it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At first K. was about to say, ""Hecertainly is a judge,"" but he held himself back for the time being andwent closer to the picture as if he wanted to study it in detail.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Therewas a large figure shown in middle of the throne's back rest which K.could not understand and asked the painter about it.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That'll need somemore work done on it, the painter told him, and taking a pastel crayonfrom a small table he added a few strokes to the edges of the figure butwithout making it any clearer as far as K. could make out.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That's thefigure of justice,"" said the painter, finally.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Now I see,"" said K.,""here's the blindfold and here are the scales.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But aren't those wingson her heels, and isn't she moving?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said the painter, ""I had topaint it like that according to the contract.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It's actually the figureof justice and the goddess of victory all in one.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That is not a goodcombination,"" said K. with a smile.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Justice needs to remain still,otherwise the scales will move about and it won't be possible to make ajust verdict.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'm just doing what the client wanted,"" said thepainter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes, certainly,"" said K., who had not meant to criticiseanyone by that comment.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You've painted the figure as it actuallyappears on the throne.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No,""  said the painter, ""I've never seen thatfigure or that throne, it's all just invention, but they told me what itwas I had to paint.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""How's that?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
asked K. pretending not fully tounderstand what the painter said.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That is a judge sitting on thejudge's chair, isn't it?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said the painter, ""but that judgeisn't very high up and he's never sat on any throne like that.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""And hehas himself painted in such a grand pose?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He's sitting there just likethe president of the court.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yeah, gentlemen like this are very vain,""said the painter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""But they have permission from higher up to getthemselves painted like this.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It's laid down quite strictly just whatsort of portrait each of them can get for himself.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Only it's a pitythat you can't make out the details of his costume and pose in thispicture, pastel colours aren't really suitable for showing people likethis.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said K., ""it does seem odd that it's in pastel colours.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""That's what the judge wanted,"" said the painter, ""it's meant to be fora woman.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The sight of the picture seemed to make him feel likeworking, he rolled up his shirtsleeves, picked up a few of the crayons,and K. watched as a reddish shadow built up around the head of the judgeunder their quivering tips and radiated out the to edges of the picture.This shadow play slowly surrounded the head like a decoration or loftydistinction.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But around the figure of Justice, apart from somecoloration that was barely noticeable, it remained light, and in thisbrightness the figure seemed to shine forward so that it now looked likeneither the God of Justice nor the God of Victory, it seemed now,rather, to be a perfect depiction of the God of the Hunt.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. found thepainter's work more engrossing than he had wanted; but finally hereproached himself for staying so long without having done anythingrelevant to his own affair.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""What's the name of this judge?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
he askedsuddenly.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'm not allowed to tell you that,"" the painter answered.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Hewas bent deeply over the picture and clearly neglecting his guest who,at first, he had received with such care.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. took this to be just afoible of the painter's, and it irritated him as it made him lose time.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I take it you must be a trustee of the court,"" he said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The painterimmediately put his crayons down, stood upright, rubbed his handstogether and looked at K. with a smile.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Always straight out with thetruth,"" he said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You want to learn something about the court, like itsays in your letter of recommendation, but then you start talking aboutmy pictures to get me on your side.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Still, I won't hold it against you,you weren't to know that that was entirely the wrong thing to try withme.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Oh, please!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"he said sharply, repelling K.'s attempt to make someobjection.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He then continued, ""And besides, you're quite right in yourcomment that I'm a trustee of the court.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He made a pause, as ifwanting to give K. the time to come to terms with this fact.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The girlscould once more be heard from behind the door.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They were probablypressed around the keyhole, perhaps they could even see into the roomthrough the gaps in the planks.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. forewent the opportunity to excusehimself in some way as he did not wish to distract the painter from whathe was saying, or else perhaps he didn't want him to get too far abovehimself and in this way make himself to some extent unattainable, so heasked, ""Is that a publicly acknowledged position?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No,"" was thepainter's curt reply, as if the question prevented him saying any more.But K. wanted him to continue speaking and said, ""Well, positions likethat, that aren't officially acknowledged, can often have more influencethan those that are.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""And that's how it is with me,"" said the painter,and nodded with a frown.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I was talking about your case with themanufacturer yesterday, and he asked me if I wouldn't like to help you,and I answered: 'He can come and see me if he likes', and now I'mpleased to see you here so soon.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This business seems to be quiteimportant to you, and, of course, I'm not surprised at that.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Would younot like to take your coat off now?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. had intended to stay for only avery short time, but the painter's invitation was nonetheless verywelcome.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The air in the room had slowly become quite oppressive forhim, he had several times looked in amazement at a small, iron stove inthe corner that certainly could not have been lit, the heat of the roomwas inexplicable.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As he took off his winter overcoat and alsounbuttoned his frock coat the painter said to him in apology, ""I musthave warmth.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And it is very cosy here, isn't it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This room's very goodin that respect.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. made no reply, but it was actually not the heatthat made him uncomfortable but, much more, the stuffiness, the air thatalmost made it more difficult to breathe, the room had probably not beenventilated for a long time.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The unpleasantness of this was made all thestronger for K. when the painter invited him to sit on the bed while hehimself sat down on the only chair in the room in front of the easel.The painter even seemed to misunderstand why K. remained at the edge ofthe bed and urged K. to make himself comfortable, and as he hesitated hewent over to the bed himself and pressed K. deep down into thebedclothes and pillows.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then he went back to his seat and at last heasked his first objective question, which made K. forget everythingelse.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You're innocent, are you?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
he asked.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said K.  He felt asimple joy at answering this question, especially as the answer wasgiven to a private individual and therefore would have no consequences.Up till then no-one had asked him this question so openly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"To make themost of his pleasure he added, ""I am totally innocent.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""So,"" said thepainter, and he lowered his head and seemed to be thinking.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Suddenly heraised his head again and said, ""Well if you're innocent it's all verysimple.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. began to scowl, this supposed trustee of the court wastalking like an ignorant child.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""My being innocent does not make thingssimple,"" said K.  Despite everything, he couldn't help smiling andslowly shook his head.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""There are many fine details in which the courtgets lost, but in the end it reaches into some place where originallythere was nothing and pulls enormous guilt out of it.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yeah, yeah,sure,"" said the painter, as if K. had been disturbing his train ofthought for no reason.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""But you are innocent, aren't you?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Well ofcourse I am,"" said K.  ""That's the main thing,"" said the painter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Therewas no counter-argument that could influence him, but although he hadmade up his mind it was not clear whether he was talking this waybecause of conviction or indifference.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K., then, wanted to find out andsaid therefore, ""I'm sure you're more familiar with the court than I am,I know hardly more about it than what I've heard, and that's been frommany very different people.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But they were all agreed on one thing, andthat was that when ill thought-out accusations are made they are notignored, and that once the court has made an accusation it is convincedof the guilt of the defendant and it's very hard to make it thinkotherwise.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Very hard?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"the painter asked, throwing one hand up in theair.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's impossible to make it think otherwise.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If I painted all thejudges next to each other here on canvas, and you were trying to defendyourself in front of it, you'd have more success with them than you'dever have with the real court.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said K. to himself, forgettingthat he had only gone there to investigate the painter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"One of the girls behind the door started up again, and asked,""Titorelli, is he going to go soon?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Quiet!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"shouted the painter atthe door, ""Can't you see I'm talking with the gentleman?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But this wasnot enough to satisfy the girl and she asked, ""You going to paint hispicture?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And when the painter didn't answer she added, ""Please don'tpaint him, he's an 'orrible bloke.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There followed an incomprehensible,interwoven babble of shouts and replies and calls of agreement.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thepainter leapt over to the door, opened it very slightly - the girls'clasped hands could be seen stretching through the crack as if theywanted something - and said, ""If you're not quiet I'll throw you alldown the stairs.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Sit down here on the steps and be quiet.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Theyprobably did not obey him immediately, so that he had to command, ""Downon the steps!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Only then it became quiet.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'm sorry about that,"" said the painter as he returned to K.  K.had hardly turned towards the door, he had left it completely up to thepainter whether and how he would place him under his protection if hewanted to.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Even now, he made hardly any movement as the painter bentover him and, whispering into his ear in order not to be heard outside,said, ""These girls belong to the court as well.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""How's that?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"askedK., as he leant his head to one side and looked at the painter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But thepainter sat back down on his chair and, half in jest, half inexplanation, ""Well, everything belongs to the court.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That issomething I had never noticed until now,"" said K. curtly, this generalcomment of the painter's made his comment about the girls far lessdisturbing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nonetheless, K. looked for a while at the door, behindwhich the girls were now sitting quietly on the steps.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Except, that oneof them had pushed a drinking straw through a crack between the planksand was moving it slowly up and down.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You still don't seem to havemuch general idea of what the court's about"", said the painter, who hadstretched his legs wide apart and was tapping loudly on the floor withthe tip of his foot.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""But as you're innocent you won't need it anyway.I'll get you out of this by myself.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""How do you intend to do that?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""asked K.  ""You did say yourself not long ago that it's quite impossibleto go to the court with reasons and proofs.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Only impossible forreasons and proofs you take to the court yourself""  said the painter,raising his forefinger as if K. had failed to notice a fine distinction.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It goes differently if you try to do something behind the public court,that's to say in the consultation rooms, in the corridors or here, forinstance, in my studio.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. now began to find it far easier to believewhat the painter was saying, or rather it was largely in agreement withwhat he had also been told by others.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
In fact it was even quitepromising.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If it really was so easy to influence the judges throughpersonal contacts as the lawyer had said then the painter's contactswith these vain judges was especially important, and at the very leastshould not be undervalued.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And the painter would fit in very well inthe circle of assistants that K. was slowly gathering around himself.He had been noted at the bank for his talent in organising, here, wherehe was placed entirely on his own resources, would be a good opportunityto test that talent to its limits.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The painter observed the effect hisexplanation had had on K. and then, with a certain unease, said, ""Doesit not occur to you that the way I'm speaking is almost like a lawyer?It's the incessant contact with the gentlemen of the court has thatinfluence on me.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I gain a lot by it, of course, but I lose a lot,artistically speaking.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""How did you first come into contact with thejudges, then?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K., he wanted first to gain the painter's trustbefore he took him into his service.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That was very easy,"" said thepainter, ""I inherited these contacts.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
My father was court painterbefore me.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
It's a position that's always inherited.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They can't use newpeople for it, the rules governing how the various grades of officialsare painted are so many and varied, and, above all, so secret that no-one outside of certain families even knows them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In the drawer there,for instance, I've got my father's notes, which I don't show to anyone.But you're only able to paint judges if you know what they say.Although, even if I lost them no-one could ever dispute my positionbecause of all the rules I just carry round in my head.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All the judgeswant to be painted like the old, great judges were, and I'm the only onewho can do that.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You are to be envied,"" said K., thinking of hisposition at the bank.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Your position is quite unassailable, then?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""Yes, quite unassailable,"" said the painter, and he raised his shouldersin pride.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That's how I can even afford to help some poor man facingtrial now and then.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""And how do you do that?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K., as if thepainter had not just described him as a poor man.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The painter did notlet himself be distracted, but said, ""In your case, for instance, asyou're totally innocent, this is what I'll do.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The repeated mention ofK.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
's innocence was becoming irksome to him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It sometimes seemed to himas if the painter was using these comments to make a favourable outcometo the trial a precondition for his help, which of course would make thehelp itself unnecessary.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But despite these doubts K. forced himself notto interrupt the painter.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He did not want to do without the painter'shelp, that was what he had decided, and this help did not seem in anyway less questionable than that of the lawyer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. valued the painter'shelp far more highly because it was offered in a way that was moreharmless and open.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The painter had pulled his seat closer to the bed and continued ina subdued voice: ""I forgot to ask you; what sort of acquittal is it youwant?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There are three possibilities; absolute acquittal, apparentacquittal and deferment.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Absolute acquittal is the best, of course,only there's nothing I could do to get that sort of outcome.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
I don'tthink there's anyone at all who could do anything to get an absoluteacquittal.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Probably the only thing that could do that is if the accusedis innocent.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
As you are innocent it could actually be possible and youcould depend on your innocence alone.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In that case you won't need me orany other kind of help.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At first, K. was astonished at this orderly explanation, but then,just as quietly as the painter, he said, ""I think you're contradictingyourself.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""How's that?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked the painter patiently, leaning back witha smile.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
This smile made K. feel as if he were examining not the wordsof the painter but seeking out inconsistencies in the procedures of thecourt itself.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nonetheless, he continued unabashed and said, ""Youremarked earlier that the court cannot be approached with reasonedproofs, you later restricted this to the open court, and now you go sofar as to say that an innocent man needs no assistance in court.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Thatentails a contradiction.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Moreover, you said earlier that the judges canbe influenced personally but now you insist that an absolute acquittal,as you call it, can never be attained through personal influence.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thatentails a second contradiction.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's quite easy to clear up thesecontradictions,"" said the painter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""We're talking about two differentthings here, there's what it says in the law and there's what I knowfrom my own experience, you shouldn't get the two confused.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I've neverseen it in writing, but the law does, of course, say on the one handthat the innocent will be set free, but on the other hand it doesn't saythat the judges can be influenced.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But in my experience it's the otherway round.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
I don't know of any absolute acquittals but I do know ofmany times when a judge has been influenced.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It's possible, of course,that there was no innocence in any of the cases I know about.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But isthat likely?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Not a single innocent defendant in so many cases?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When Iwas a boy I used to listen closely to my father when he told us aboutcourt cases at home, and the judges that came to his studio talked aboutthe court, in our circles nobody talks about anything else; I hardlyever got the chance to go to court myself but always made use of it whenI could, I've listened to countless trials at important stages in theirdevelopment, I've followed them closely as far as they could befollowed, and I have to say that I've never seen a single acquittal.""""So.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Not a single acquittal,"" said K., as if talking to himself and hishopes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That confirms the impression I already have of the court.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Sothere's no point in it from this side either.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They could replace thewhole court with a single hangman.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You shouldn't generalise,"" saidthe painter, dissatisfied, ""I've only been talking about my ownexperience.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Well that's enough,"" said K., ""or have you heard of anyacquittals that happened earlier?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""They say there have been someacquittals earlier,"" the painter answered, ""but it's very hard to besure about it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The courts don't make their final conclusions public,not even the judges are allowed to know about them, so that all we knowabout these earlier cases are just legends.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But most of them didinvolve absolute acquittals, you can believe that, but they can't beproved.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the other hand, you shouldn't forget all about them either,I'm sure there is some truth to them, and they are very beautiful, I'vepainted a few pictures myself depicting these legends.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""My assessmentwill not be altered by mere legends,"" said K.  ""I don't suppose it'spossible to cite these legends in court, is it?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The painter laughed.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No, you can't cite them in court,"" he said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Then there's no point intalking about them,"" said K., he wanted, for the time being, to acceptanything the painter told him, even if he thought it unlikely orcontradicted what he had been told by others.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He did not now have thetime to examine the truth of everything the painter said or even todisprove it, he would have achieved as much as he could if the painterwould help him in any way even if his help would not be decisive.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As aresult, he said, ""So let's pay no more attention to absolute acquittal,but you mentioned two other possibilities.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Apparent acquittal anddeferment.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They're the only possibilities,"" said the painter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Butbefore we talk about them, would you not like to take your coat off?You must be hot.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said K., who until then had paid attention tonothing but the painter's explanations, but now that he had had the heatpointed out to him his brow began to sweat heavily.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"""Could we not open the window?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K.  ""No,"" said thepainter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's only a fixed pane of glass, it can't be opened.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial

He had preparedhimself even for the fog that he would breathe in through his openmouth.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
The thought that here he was entirely cut off from the air madehim feel dizzy.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He tapped lightly on the bedspread beside him and, witha weak voice, said, ""That is very inconvenient and unhealthy.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Oh no,""said the painter in defence of his window, ""as it can't be opened thisroom retains the heat better than if the window were double glazed, eventhough it's only a single pane.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There's not much need to air the roomas there's so much ventilation through the gaps in the wood, but when Ido want to I can open one of my doors, or even both of them.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. wasslightly consoled by this explanation and looked around to see where thesecond door was.,Franz Kafka,The Trial

"Forinstance when the judge I'm painting at present comes he always comesthrough the door by the bed, and I've even given him a key to this doorso that he can wait for me here in the studio when I'm not home.Although nowadays he usually comes early in the morning when I'm stillasleep.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And of course, it always wakes me up when I hear the dooropened beside the bed, however fast asleep I am.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If you could hear theway I curse him as he climbs over my bed in the morning you'd lose allrespect for judges.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
I suppose I could take the key away from him butthat'd only make things worse.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It only takes a tiny effort to break anyof the doors here off their hinges.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All the time the painter wasspeaking, K. was considering whether he should take off his coat, but hefinally realised that, if he didn't do so, he would be quite unable tostay here any longer, so he took off his frock coat and lay it on hisknee so that he could put it back on again as soon as the conversationwas over.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had hardly done this when one of the girls called out,""Now he's taken his coat off!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
and they could all be heard pressingaround the gaps in the planks to see the spectacle for themselves.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Thegirls think I'm going to paint your portrait,"" said the painter, ""andthat's why you're taking your coat off.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I see,"" said K., onlyslightly amused by this, as he felt little better than he had beforeeven though he now sat in his shirtsleeves.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"With some irritation heasked, ""What did you say the two other possibilities were?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He hadalready forgotten the terms used.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Apparent acquittal and deferment,""said the painter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's up to you which one you choose.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You can geteither of them if I help you, but it'll take some effort of course, thedifference between them is that apparent acquittal needs concentratedeffort for a while and that deferment takes much less effort but it hasto be sustained.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now then, apparent acquittal.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If that's what you wantI'll write down an assertion of your innocence on a piece of paper.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Thetext for an assertion of this sort was passed down to me from my fatherand it's quite unassailable.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
I take this assertion round to the judgesI know.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"So I'll start off with the one I'm currently painting, and putthe assertion to him when he comes for his sitting this evening.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I'lllay the assertion in front of him, explain that you're innocent and givehim my personal guarantee of it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And that's not just a superficialguarantee, it's a real one and it's binding.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The painter's eyes seemedto show some reproach of K. for wanting to impose that sort ofresponsibility on him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That would be very kind of you"", said K.  ""Andwould the judge then believe you and nonetheless not pass an absoluteacquittal?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's like I just said,"" answered the painter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Andanyway, it's not entirely sure that all the judges would believe me,many of them, for instance, might want me to bring you to see thempersonally.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
So then you'd have to come along too.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But at least then,if that happens, the matter is half way won, especially as I'd teach youin advance exactly how you'd need to act with the judge concerned, ofcourse.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"What also happens, though, is that there are some judges who'llturn me down in advance, and that's worse.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I'll certainly make severalattempts, but still, we'll have to forget about them, but at least wecan afford to do that as no one judge can pass the decisive verdict.Then when I've got enough judges' signatures on this document I take itto the judge who's concerned with your case.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I might even have hissignature already, in which case things develop a bit quicker than theywould do otherwise.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But there aren't usually many hold ups from thenon, and that's the time that the defendant can feel most confident.It's odd, but true, that people feel more confidence in this time thanthey do after they've been acquitted.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
There's no particular exertionneeded now.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When he has the document asserting the defendant'sinnocence, guaranteed by a number of other judges, the judge can acquityou without any worries, and although there are still severalformalities to be gone through there's no doubt that that's what he'lldo as a favour to me and several other acquaintances.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You, however,walk out the court and you're free.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""So, then I'll be free,"" said K.,hesitantly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That's right,"" said the painter, ""but only apparently freeor, to put it a better way, temporarily free, as the most junior judges,the ones I know, they don't have the right to give the final acquittal.Only the highest judge can do that, in the court that's quite out of reachfor you, for me and for all of us.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"We don't know how things look thereand, incidentally, we don't want to know.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The right to acquit peopleis a major privilege and our judges don't have it, but they do have theright to free people from the indictment.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That's to say, if they'refreed in this way then for the time being the charge is withdrawn butit's still hanging over their heads and it only takes an order fromhigher up to bring it back into force.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And as I'm in such good contactwith the court I can also tell you how the difference between absoluteand apparent acquittal is described, just in a superficial way, in thedirectives to the court offices.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If there's an absolute acquittal allproceedings should stop, everything disappears from the process, notjust the indictment but the trial and even the acquittal disappears,everything just disappears.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"With an apparent acquittal it's different.When that happens, nothing has changed except that the case for yourinnocence, for your acquittal and the grounds for the acquittal havebeen made stronger.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Apart from that, proceedings go on as before, thecourt offices continue their business and the case gets passed to highercourts, gets passed back down to the lower courts and so on, backwardsand forwards, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, to and fro.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It'simpossible to know exactly what's happening while this is going on.Seen from outside it can sometimes seem that everything has been longsince forgotten, the documents have been lost and the acquittal iscomplete.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
No-one familiar with the court would believe it.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nodocuments ever get lost, the court forgets nothing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"One day - no-oneexpects it - some judge or other picks up the documents and looks moreclosely at them, he notices that this particular case is still active,and orders the defendant's immediate arrest.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I've been talking here asif there's a long delay between apparent acquittal and re-arrest, thatis quite possible and I do know of cases like that, but it's just aslikely that the defendant goes home after he's been acquitted and findssomebody there waiting to re-arrest him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then, of course, his life as afree man is at an end.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""And does the trial start over again?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"askedK., finding it hard to believe.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""The trial will always start overagain,"" said the painter, ""but there is, once again as before, thepossibility of getting an apparent acquittal.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Once again, the accusedhas to muster all his strength and mustn't give up.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The painter saidthat last phrase possibly as a result of the impression that K., whoseshoulders had dropped somewhat, gave on him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""But to get a secondacquittal,"" asked K., as if in anticipation of further revelations bythe painter, ""is that not harder to get than the first time?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""As faras that's concerned,"" answered the painter, ""there's nothing you can sayfor certain.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You mean, do you, that the second arrest would have anadverse influence on the judge and the verdict he passes on thedefendant?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
That's not how it happens.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
When the acquittal is passed thejudges are already aware that re-arrest is likely.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
So when it happensit has hardly any effect.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But there are countless other reasons why thejudges' mood and their legal acumen in the case can be altered, andefforts to obtain the second acquittal must therefore be suited to thenew conditions, and generally just as vigorous as the first.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""But thissecond acquittal will once again not be final,"" said K., shaking hishead.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Of course not,"" said the painter, ""the second acquittal isfollowed by the third arrest, the third acquittal by the fourth arrestand so on.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That's what is meant by the term apparent acquittal.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K.was silent.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You clearly don't think an apparent acquittal offers muchadvantage,"" said the painter, ""perhaps deferment would suit you better.Would you like me to explain what deferment is about?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. nodded.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thepainter had leant back and spread himself out in his chair, hisnightshirt was wide open, he had pushed his hand inside and was strokinghis breast and his sides.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Deferment,"" said the painter, lookingvaguely in front of himself for a while as if trying to find a perfectlyappropriate explanation, ""deferment consists of keeping proceedingspermanently in their earliest stages.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"To do that, the accused and thosehelping him need to keep in continuous personal contact with the court,especially those helping him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I repeat, this doesn't require so mucheffort as getting an apparent acquittal, but it probably requires a lotmore attention.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You must never let the trial out of your sight, youhave to go and see the appropriate judge at regular intervals as well aswhen something in particular comes up and, whatever you do, you have totry and remain friendly with him; if you don't know the judge personallyyou have to influence him through the judges you do know, and you haveto do it without giving up on the direct discussions.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
As long as youdon't fail to do any of these things you can be reasonably sure thetrial won't get past its first stages.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The trial doesn't stop, but thedefendant is almost as certain of avoiding conviction as if he'd beenacquitted.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Compared with an apparent acquittal, deferment has theadvantage that the defendant's future is less uncertain, he's safe fromthe shock of being suddenly re-arrested and doesn't need to fear theexertions and stress involved in getting an apparent acquittal just wheneverything else in his life would make it most difficult.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Defermentdoes have certain disadvantages of its own though, too, and theyshouldn't be under-estimated.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I don't mean by this that the defendantis never free, he's never free in the proper sense of the word with anapparent acquittal either.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
There's another disadvantage.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Proceedingscan't be prevented from moving forward unless there are some at leastostensible reasons given.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
So something needs to seem to be happeningwhen looked at from the outside.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This means that from time to timevarious injunctions have to be obeyed, the accused has to be questioned,investigations have to take place and so on.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The trial's beenartificially constrained inside a tiny circle, and it has to becontinuously spun round within it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And that, of course, brings with itcertain unpleasantnesses for the accused, although you shouldn't imaginethey're all that bad.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All of this is just for show, the interrogations,for instance, they're only very short, if you ever don't have the timeor don't feel like going to them you can offer an excuse, with somejudges you can even arrange the injunctions together a long time inadvance, in essence all it means is that, as the accused, you have toreport to the judge from time to time.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Even while the painter wasspeaking those last words K. had laid his coat over his arm and hadstood up.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Immediately, from outside the door, there was a cry of  'He'sstanding up now!'.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Are you leaving already?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked the painter, whohad also stood up.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It must be the air that's driving you out.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
I'mvery sorry about that.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
There's still a lot I need to tell you.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
I hadto put everything very briefly but I hope at least it was all clear.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""Oh yes,"" said K., whose head was aching from the effort of listening.Despite this affirmation the painter summed it all up once more, as ifhe wanted to give K. something to console him on his way home.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Bothhave in common that they prevent the defendant being convicted,"" hesaid.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""But they also prevent his being properly acquitted,"" said K.quietly, as if ashamed to acknowledge it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You've got it, in essence,""said the painter quickly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. placed his hand on his winter overcoat butcould not bring himself to put it on.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Most of all he would have likedto pack everything together and run out to the fresh air.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Not even thegirls could induce him to put his coat on, even though they were alreadyloudly telling each other that he was doing so.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The painter still hadto interpret K.'s mood in some way, so he said, ""I expect you'vedeliberately avoided deciding between my suggestions yet.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
That's good.I would even have advised against making a decision straight away.There's no more than a hair's breadth of difference between theadvantages and disadvantages.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Everything has to be carefully weighedup.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
But the most important thing is you shouldn't lose too much time.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""I'll come back here again soon,"" said K., who had suddenly decided toput his frock coat on, threw his overcoat over his shoulder and hurriedover to the door behind which the girls now began to scream.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. thoughthe could even see the screaming girls through the door.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Well, you'llhave to keep your word,"" said the painter, who had not followed him,""otherwise I'll come to the bank to ask about it myself.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Will you openthis door for me,"" said K. pulling at the handle which, as he noticedfrom the resistance, was being held tightly by the girls on the otherside.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Do you want to be bothered by the girls?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
asked the painter.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's better if you use the other way out,"" he said, pointing to thedoor behind the bed.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. agreed to this and jumped back to the bed.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Butinstead of opening that door the painter crawled under the bed and fromunderneath it asked K., ""Just a moment more, would you not like to see apicture I could sell to you?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. did not want to be impolite, thepainter really had taken his side and promised to help him more in thefuture, and because of K.'s forgetfulness there had been no mention ofany payment for the painter's help, so K. could not turn him down nowand allowed him to show him the picture, even though he was quiveringwith impatience to get out of the studio.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"From under the bed, thepainter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They were so covered indust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the dustswirled around in front of K.'s eyes, robbing him of breath for sometime.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Moorland landscape,"" said the painter passing the picture to K.It showed two sickly trees, well separated from each other in darkgrass.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
In the background there was a multi-coloured sunset.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That'snice,"" said K.  ""I'll buy it.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. expressed himself in this curt waywithout any thought, so he was glad when the painter did not take thisamiss and picked up a second painting from the floor.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""This is acounterpart to the first picture,"" said the painter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Perhaps it hadbeen intended as a counterpart, but there was not the slightestdifference to be seen between it and the first picture, there were thetrees, there the grass and there the sunset.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But this was of littleimportance to K.  ""They are beautiful landscapes,"" he said, ""I'll buythem both and hang them in my office.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You seem to like this subject,""said the painter, picking up a third painting, ""good job I've still gotanother, similar picture here.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The picture though, was not similar,rather it was exactly the same moorland landscape.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The painter wasfully exploiting this opportunity to sell off his old pictures.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'lltake this one too,"" said K.  ""How much do the three paintings cost?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""We can talk about that next time,"" said the painter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You're in ahurry now, and we'll still be in contact.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And besides, I'm glad youlike the paintings, I'll give you all the paintings I've got down here.They're all moorland landscapes, I've painted a lot of moorlandlandscapes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"A lot of people don't like that sort of picture becausethey're too gloomy, but there are others, and you're one of them, wholove gloomy themes.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But K. was not in the mood to hear about theprofessional experiences of this painter cum beggar.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Wrap them allup!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"he called out, interrupting the painter as he was speaking, ""myservant will come to fetch them in the morning.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"""Just step on the bed, don't worry about that,"" said the painter,""that's what everyone does who comes in here.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Even without thisinvitation, K. had shown no compunction in already placing his foot inthe middle of the bed covers, then he looked out through the open doorand drew his foot back again.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"""What are you so surprised at?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"he asked, surprised in his turn.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"It was not so much finding court officeseven here that shocked K., he was mainly shocked at himself, at his ownnaÃ¯vety in court matters.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It seemed to him that one of the most basicrules governing how a defendant should behave was always to be prepared,never allow surprises, never to look, unsuspecting, to the right whenthe judge stood beside him to his left - and this was the very basicrule that he was continually violating.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"A long corridor extended infront of him, air blew in from it which, compared with the air in thestudio, was refreshing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
There were benches set along each side of thecorridor just as in the waiting area for the office he went to himself.There seemed to be precise rules governing how offices should beequipped.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
There did not seem to be many people visiting the officesthat day.,Franz Kafka,The Trial

Theysoon came across a servant of the court - K. was now able to recogniseall the servants of the court from the gold buttons they wore on theircivilian clothes below the normal buttons - and the painter instructedhim to go with K. carrying the pictures.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. staggered more than hewalked, his handkerchief pressed over his mouth.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"The room contained a narrow bed whichfilled it completely, so that to get into the bed you would need toclimb over the bedpost.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At the head of the bed there was a niche in thewall where, fastidiously tidy, stood a candle, a bottle of ink, and apen with a bundle of papers which were probably to do with the trial.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You sleep in the maid's room?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K., as he went back to thebusinessman.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Leni's let me have it,"" answered the businessman, ""it hasmany advantages.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. looked long at him; his first impression of thebusinessman had perhaps not been right; he had experience as his trialhad already lasted a long time, but he had paid a heavy price for thisexperience.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. was suddenly unable to bear the sight of the businessmanany longer.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Bring him to bed, then!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"he called out to Leni, who seemedto understand him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"For himself, he wanted to go to the lawyer and, bydismissing him, free himself from not only the lawyer but also from Leniand the businessman.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But before he had reached the door the businessmanspoke to him gently.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Excuse me, sir,"" he said, and K. looked roundcrossly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You've forgotten your promise,"" said the businessman,stretching his hand out to K. imploringly from where he sat.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You weregoing to tell me a secret.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That is true,"" said K., as he glanced atLeni, who was watching him carefully, to check on her.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""So listen; it'shardly a secret now anyway.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I'm going to see the lawyer now to sackhim.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""He's sacking him!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"yelled the businessman, and he jumped up fromhis chair and ran around the kitchen with his arms in the air.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He kepton shouting, ""He's sacking his lawyer!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Leni tried to rush at K. butthe businessman got in her way so that she shoved him away with herfists.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then, still with her hands balled into fists, she ran after K.who, however, had been given a long start.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He was already inside thelawyer's room by the time Leni caught up with him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had almost closedthe door behind himself, but Leni held the door open with her foot,grabbed his arm and tried to pull him back.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But he put such pressure onher wrist that, with a sigh, she was forced to release him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She did notdare go into the room straight away, and K. locked the door with thekey.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I've been waiting for you a very long time,"" said the lawyer fromhis bed.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had been reading something by the light of a candle but nowhe laid it onto the bedside table and put his glasses on, looking at K.sharply through them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Instead of apologising K. said, ""I'll be leavingagain soon.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As he had not apologised the lawyer ignored what K. said,and replied, ""I won't let you in this late again next time.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I findthat quite acceptable,"" said K.  The lawyer looked at him quizzically.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Sit down,"" he said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""As you wish,"" said K., drawing a chair up to thebedside table and sitting down.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It seemed to me that you locked the door,"" said the lawyer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,""said K., ""it was because of Leni.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He had no intention of lettinganyone off lightly.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But the lawyer asked him, ""Was she beingimportunate again?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Importunate?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K.  ""Yes,"" said the lawyer,laughing as he did so, had a fit of coughing and then, once it hadpassed, began to laugh again.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'm sure you must have noticed howimportunate she can be sometimes,"" he said, and patted K.'s hand whichK.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
had rested on the bedside table and which he now snatched back.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Youdon't attach much importance to it, then,"" said the lawyer when K. wassilent, ""so much the better.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Otherwise I might have needed to apologiseto you.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
It is a peculiarity of Leni's.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I've long since forgiven herfor it, and I wouldn't be talking of it now, if you hadn't locked thedoor just now.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Anyway, perhaps I should at least explain thispeculiarity of hers to you, but you seem rather disturbed, the wayyou're looking at me, and so that's why I'll do it, this peculiarity ofhers consists in this; Leni finds most of the accused attractive.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Sheattaches herself to each of them, loves each of them, even seems to beloved by each of them; then she sometimes entertains me by telling meabout them when I allow her to.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
I am not so astonished by all of thisas you seem to be.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If you look at them in the right way the accusedreally can be attractive, quite often.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But that is a remarkable and tosome extent scientific phenomenon.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Being indicted does not cause anyclear, precisely definable change in a person's appearance, of course.But it's not like with other legal matters, most of them remain in theirusual way of life and, if they have a good lawyer looking after them,the trial doesn't get in their way.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But there are nonetheless those whohave experience in these matters who can look at a crowd, however big,and tell you which among them is facing a charge.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"How can they do that,you will ask.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
My answer will not please you.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
It is simply that thosewho are facing a charge are the most attractive.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It cannot be theirguilt that makes them attractive as not all of them are guilty - atleast that's what I, as a lawyer, have to say - and nor can it be theproper punishment that has made them attractive as not all of them arepunished, so it can only be that the proceedings levelled against themtake some kind of hold on them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Whatever the reason, some of theseattractive people are indeed very attractive.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But all of them areattractive, even Block, pitiful worm that he is.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As the lawyerfinished what he was saying, K. was fully in control of himself, he hadeven nodded conspicuously at his last few words in order to confirm tohimself the view he had already formed; that the lawyer was trying toconfuse him, as he always did, by making general and irrelevantobservations, and thus distract him from the main question of what hewas actually doing for K.'s trial.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The lawyer must have noticed that K.was offering him more resistance than before, as he became silent,giving  K. the chance to speak himself, and then, as K. also remainedsilent, he asked, ""Did you have a particular reason for coming to see metoday?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said K., putting his hand up to slightly shade his eyesfrom the light of the candle so that he could see the lawyer better, ""Iwanted to tell you that I'm withdrawing my representation from you, withimmediate effect.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Do I understand you rightly?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
asked the lawyer ashe half raised himself in his bed and supported himself with one hand onthe pillow.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I think you do,"" said K., sitting stiffly upright as ifwaiting in ambush.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Well we can certainly discuss this plan of yours,""said the lawyer after a pause.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It's not a plan any more,"" said K.""That may be,"" said the lawyer, ""but we still mustn't rush anything.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""He used the word 'we', as if he had no intention of letting K. go free,and as if, even if he could no longer represent him, he could still atleast continue as his adviser.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Nothing is being rushed,"" said K.,standing slowly up and going behind his chair, ""everything has been wellthought out and probably even for too long.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The decision is final.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""Then allow me to say a few words,"" said the lawyer, throwing the bedcover to one side and sitting on the edge of the bed.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"His naked, white-haired legs shivered in the cold.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He asked K. to pass him a blanketfrom the couch.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. passed him the blanket and said, ""You are runningthe risk of catching cold for no reason.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""The circumstances areimportant enough,"" said the lawyer as he wrapped the bed cover aroundthe top half of his body and then the blanket around his legs.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Youruncle is my friend and in the course of time I've become fond of you aswell.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
I admit that quite openly.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There's nothing in that for me to beashamed of.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It  was very unwelcome for K. to hear the old man speak inthis touching way, as it forced him to explain himself more fully, whichhe would rather have avoided, and he was aware that it also confused himeven though it could never make him reverse his decision.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Thank youfor feeling so friendly toward me,"" he said, ""and I also realise howdeeply involved you've been in my case, as deeply as possible foryourself and to bring as much advantage as possible to me.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nonetheless,I have recently come to the conviction that it is not enough.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I wouldnaturally never attempt, considering that you are so much older and moreexperienced than I am, to convince you of my opinion; if I have everunintentionally done so then I beg your forgiveness, but, as you havejust said yourself, the circumstances are important enough and it is mybelief that my trial needs to be approached with much more vigour thanhas so far been the case.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I see,"" said the lawyer, ""you've becomeimpatient.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I am not impatient,"" said K., with some irritation and hestopped paying so much attention to his choice of words.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""When I firstcame here with my uncle you probably noticed I wasn't greatly concernedabout my case, and if I wasn't reminded of it by force, as it were, Iwould forget about it completely.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But my uncle insisted I should allowyou to represent me and I did so as a favour to him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I could haveexpected the case to be less of a burden than it had been, as the pointof taking on a lawyer is that he should take on some of its weight.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Butwhat actually happened was the opposite.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Before, the trial was neversuch a worry for me as it has been since you've been representing me.When I was by myself I never did anything about my case, I was hardlyaware of it, but then, once there was someone representing me,everything was set for something to happen, I was always, without cease,waiting for you to do something, getting more and more tense, but youdid nothing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I did get some information about the court from you that Iprobably could not have got anywhere else, but that can't be enough whenthe trial, supposedly in secret, is getting closer and closer to me.""K.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"had pushed the chair away and stood erect, his hands in the pocketsof his frock coat.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""After a certain point in the proceedings,"" said thelawyer quietly and calmly, ""nothing new of any importance ever happens.So many litigants, at the same stage in their trials, have stood beforeme just like you are now and spoken in the same way.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Then these otherlitigants,"" said K., ""have all been right, just as I am.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That does notshow that I'm not.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I wasn't trying to show that you were mistaken,""said the lawyer, ""but I wanted to add that I expected better judgementfrom you than from the others, especially as I've given you more insightinto the workings of the court and my own activities than I normally do.And now I'm forced to accept that, despite everything, you have toolittle trust in me.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You don't make it easy for me.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
How the lawyer washumiliating himself to K.!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He was showing no regard for the dignity ofhis position, which on this point, must have been at its most sensitive.And why did he do that?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He did seem to be very busy as a lawyer as wella rich man, neither the loss of income nor the loss of a client couldhave been of much importance to him in themselves.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He was moreoverunwell and should have been thinking of passing work on to others.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Anddespite all that he held on tightly to K.  Why?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Was it somethingpersonal for his uncle's sake, or did he really see K.'s case as onethat was exceptional and hoped to be able to distinguish himself withit, either for K.'s sake or - and this possibility could never beexcluded - for his friends at the court?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was not possible to learnanything by looking at him, even though K. was scrutinizing him quitebrazenly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It could almost be supposed he was deliberately hiding histhoughts as he waited to see what effect his words would have.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But heclearly deemed K.'s silence to be favourable for himself and hecontinued, ""You will have noticed the size of my office, but that Idon't employ any staff to help me.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That used to be quite different,there was a time when several young lawyers were working for me but nowI work alone.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"This is partly to do with changes in the way I dobusiness, in that I concentrate nowadays more and more on matters suchas your own case, and partly to do with the ever deeper understandingthat I acquire from these legal matters.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
I found that I could never letanyone else deal with this sort of work unless I wanted to harm both theclient and the job I had taken on.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But the decision to do all the workmyself had its obvious result: I was forced to turn almost everyone awaywho asked me to represent them and could only accept those I wasespecially interested in - well there are enough creatures who leap atevery crumb I throw down, and they're not so very far away.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Mostimportantly, I became ill from over-work.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But despite that I don'tregret my decision, quite possibly I should have turned more cases awaythan I did, but it did turn out to be entirely necessary for me todevote myself fully to the cases I did take on, and the successfulresults showed that it was worth it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I once read a description of thedifference between representing someone in ordinary legal matters and inlegal matters of this sort, and the writer expressed it very well.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thisis what he said: some lawyers lead their clients on a thread untiljudgement is passed, but there are others who immediately lift theirclients onto their shoulders and carry them all the way to the judgementand beyond.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
That's just how it is.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
But it was quite true when I said Inever regret all this work.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But if, as in your case, they are so fullymisunderstood, well, then I come very close to regretting it.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
All thistalking did more to make K. impatient than to persuade him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"From theway the lawyer was speaking, K. thought he could hear what he couldexpect if he gave in, the delays and excuses would begin again, reportsof how the documents were progressing, how the mood of the courtofficials had improved, as well as all the enormous difficulties - inshort all that he had heard so many times before would be brought outagain even more fully, he would try to mislead K. with hopes that werenever specified and to make him suffer with threats that were neverclear.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had to put a stop to that, so he said, ""What will youundertake on my behalf if you continue to represent me?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The lawyerquietly accepted even this insulting question, and answered, ""I shouldcontinue with what I've already been doing for you.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That's just whatI thought,"" said K., ""and now you don't need to say another word.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Iwill make one more attempt,"" said the lawyer as if whatever had beenmaking K. so annoyed was affecting him too.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You see, I have theimpression that you have not only misjudged the legal assistance I havegiven you but also that that misjudgement has led you to behave in thisway, you seem, although you are the accused, to have been treated toowell or, to put it a better way, handled with neglect, with apparentneglect.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Even that has its reason; it is often better to be in chainsthan to be free.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But I would like to show you how other defendants aretreated, perhaps you will succeed in learning something from it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"What Iwill do is I will call Block in, unlock the door and sit down herebeside the bedside table.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Be glad to,"" said K., and did as the lawyersuggested; he was always ready to learn something new.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But to make sureof himself for any event he added, ""but you do realise that you are nolonger to be my lawyer, don't you?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said the lawyer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""But youcan still change your mind today if you want to.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He lay back down inthe bed, pulled the quilt up to his chin and turned to face the wall.Then he rang.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Leni appeared almost the moment he had done so.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
She lookedhurriedly at K. and the lawyer to try and find out what had happened;she seemed to be reassured by the sight of K. sitting calmly at thelawyer's bed.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"She smiled and nodded to K., K. looked blankly back ather.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Fetch Block,"" said the lawyer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But instead of going to fetchhim, Leni just went to the door and called out, ""Block!",Franz Kafka,The Trial
To the lawyer!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Then, probably because the lawyer had turned his face to the wall andwas paying no attention, she slipped in behind K.'s chair.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"From thenon, she bothered him by leaning forward over the back of the chair or,albeit very tenderly and carefully, she would run her hands through hishair and over his cheeks.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. eventually tried to stop her by takinghold of one hand, and after some resistance Leni let him keep hold ofit.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Block came as soon as he was called, but he remained standing inthe doorway and seemed to be wondering whether he should enter or not.He raised his eyebrows and lowered his head as if listening to find outwhether the order to attend the lawyer would be repeated.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. could haveencouraged to enter, but he had decided to make a final break not onlywith the lawyer but with everything in his home, so he kept himselfmotionless.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Leni was also silent.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Block noticed that at least no-onewas chasing him away, and, on tiptoe, he entered the room, his face wastense, his hands were clenched behind his back.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He left the door openin case he needed to go back again.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. did not even glance at him, helooked instead only at the thick quilt under which the lawyer could notbe seen as he had squeezed up very close to the wall.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then his voicewas heard: ""Block here?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
he asked.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Block had already crept some wayinto the room but this question seemed to give him first a shove in thebreast and then another in the back, he seemed about to fall butremained standing, deeply bowed, and said, ""At your service, sir.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"asked the lawyer, ""you've come at a bad time.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"Then, after a pause he added,""You always come at a bad time.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When the lawyer started speaking Blockhad stopped looking at the bed but stared rather into one of thecorners, just listening, as if the light from the speaker were brighterthan Block could bear to look at.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But it was also difficult for him tolisten, as the lawyer was speaking into the wall and speaking quicklyand quietly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Would you like me to go away again, sir?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
asked Block.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Well you're here now,"" said the lawyer.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Stay!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was as if thelawyer had not done as Block had wanted but instead threatened him witha stick, as now Block really began to shake.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I went to see,"" said thelawyer, ""the third judge yesterday, a friend of mine, and slowly broughtthe conversation round to the subject of you.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Do you want to know whathe said?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Oh, yes please,"" said Block.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The lawyer did not answerimmediately, so Block repeated his request and lowered his head as ifabout to kneel down.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But then K. spoke to him:  ""What do you thinkyou're doing?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
he shouted.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Leni had wanted to stop him from calling outand so he took hold of her other hand.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was not love that made himsqueeze it and hold on to it so tightly, she sighed frequently and triedto disengage her hands from him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

Even if he had done nothing earlier to make himwant to leave then this scene would have done so.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was almosthumiliating even for the onlooker.,Franz Kafka,The Trial

asked thelawyer.,Franz Kafka,The Trial

"""Yes,"" said the lawyer, ""theycertainly are that.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"""This chapter was left unfinished.Chapter NineIn the Cathedral        A very important Italian business contact of the bank had come tovisit the city for the first time and K. was given the task of showinghim some of its cultural sights.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At any other time he would have seenthis job as an honour but now, when he was finding it hard even tomaintain his current position in the bank, he accepted it only withreluctance.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Every hour that he could not be in the office was a causeof concern for him, he was no longer able to make use of his time in theoffice anything like as well as he had previously, he spent many hoursmerely pretending to do important work, but that only increased hisanxiety about not being in the office.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then he sometimes thought he sawthe deputy director, who was always watching, come into K.'s office, sitat his desk, look through his papers, receive clients who had almostbecome old friends of K., and lure them away from him, perhaps he evendiscovered mistakes, mistakes that seemed to threaten K. from a thousanddirections when he was at work now, and which he could no longer avoid.So now, if he was ever asked to leave the office on business or evenneeded to make a short business trip, however much an honour it seemed -and tasks of this sort happened to have increased substantially recently- there was always the suspicion that they wanted to get him out of hisoffice for a while and check his work, or at least the idea that theythought he was dispensable.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It would not have been difficult for him toturn down most of these jobs, but he did not dare to do so because, ifhis fears had the slightest foundation, turning the jobs down would havebeen an acknowledgement of them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"For this reason, he never demurredfrom accepting them, and even when he was asked to go on a tiringbusiness trip lasting two days he said nothing about having to go out inthe rainy autumn weather when he had a severe chill, just in order toavoid the risk of not being asked to go.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When, with a raging headache,he arrived back from this trip he learned that he had been chosen toaccompany the Italian business contact the following day.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thetemptation for once to turn the job down was very great, especially asit had no direct connection with business, but there was no denying thatsocial obligations towards this business contact were in themselvesimportant enough, only not for K., who knew quite well that he neededsome successes at work if he was to maintain his position there andthat, if he failed in that, it would not help him even if this Italiansomehow found him quite charming; he did not want to be removed from hisworkplace for even one day, as the fear of not being allowed back in wastoo great, he knew full well that the fear was exaggerated but it stillmade him anxious.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"However, in this case it was almost impossible tothink of an acceptable excuse, his knowledge of Italian was not greatbut still good enough; the deciding factor was that K. had earlier knowna little about art history and this had become widely known around thebank in extremely exaggerated form, and that K. had been a member of theSociety for the Preservation of City Monuments, albeit only for businessreasons.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was said that this Italian was an art lover, so the choiceof K. to accompany him was a matter of course.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was a very rainy and stormy morning when K., in a foul temperat the thought of the day ahead of him, arrived early at seven o'clockin the office so that he could at least do some work before his visitorwould prevent him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had spent half the night studying a book ofItalian grammar so that he would be somewhat prepared and was verytired; his desk was less attractive to him than the window where he hadspent far too much time sitting of late, but he resisted the temptationand sat down to his work.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Unfortunately, just then the servitor came inand reported that the director had sent him to see whether the chiefclerk was already in his office; if he was, then would he please be sokind as to come to his reception room as the gentleman from Italy wasalready there.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'll come straight away,"" said K.  He put a smalldictionary in his pocket, took a guide to the city's tourist sites underhis arm that he had compiled for strangers, and went through the deputydirector's office into that of the director.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He was glad he had comeinto the office so early and was able to be of service immediately,nobody could seriously have expected that of him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The deputy director'soffice was, of course, still as empty as the middle of the night, theservitor had probably been asked to summon him too but without success.As K. entered the reception room two men stood up from the deeparmchairs where they had been sitting.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The director gave him a friendlysmile, he was clearly very glad that K. was there, he immediatelyintroduced him to the Italian who shook K.'s hand vigorously and jokedthat somebody was an early riser.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. did not quite understand whom hehad in mind, it was moreover an odd expression to use and it took K. alittle while to guess its meaning.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He replied with a few bland phraseswhich the Italian received once more with a laugh, passing his handnervously and repeatedly over his blue-grey, bushy moustache.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thismoustache was obviously perfumed, it was almost tempting to come closeto it and sniff.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When they had all sat down and begun a lightpreliminary conversation, K. was disconcerted to notice that heunderstood no more than fragments of what the Italian said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When hespoke very calmly he understood almost everything, but that was veryinfrequent, mostly the words gushed from his mouth and he seemed to beenjoying himself so much his head shook.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When he was talking in thisway his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect whichseemed to K. to have nothing to do with Italian but which the directornot only understood but also spoke, although K. ought to have foreseenthis as the Italian came from the south of his country where thedirector had also spent several years.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Whatever the cause, K. realisedthat the possibility of communicating with the Italian had been largelytaken from him, even his French was difficult to understand, and hismoustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offeredsome help in understanding what he said.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. began to anticipate manydifficulties,  he gave up trying to understand what the Italian said -with the director there, who could understand him so easily, it wouldhave been pointless effort - and for the time being did no more thanscowl at the Italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in thearmchair, as he frequently pulled at his short, sharply tailored jacketand at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands freely totry and depict something that K. could not grasp, even though he wasleaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. hadnothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange betweenthe two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt, to his alarm,although fortunately in good time, he once caught himself nearly gettingup, turning round and leaving.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Eventually the Italian looked at theclock and jumped up.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"After taking his leave from the director he turnedto K., pressing himself so close to him that K. had to push his chairback just so that he could move.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The director had, no doubt, seen theanxiety in K.'s eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of Italian,he joined in with this conversation in a way that was so adroit andunobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no more than minor comments,whereas in fact he was swiftly and patiently breaking into what theItalian said so that K. could understand.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. learned in this way thatthe Italian first had a few business matters to settle, that heunfortunately had only a little time at his disposal, that he certainlydid not intend to rush round to see every monument in the city, that hewould much rather - at least as long as K. would agree, it was entirelyhis decision  - just see the cathedral and to do so thoroughly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He wasextremely pleased to be accompanied by someone who was so learned and sopleasant - by this he meant K., who was occupied not with listening tothe Italian but the director - and asked if he would be so kind, if thetime was suitable, to meet him in the cathedral in two hours' time atabout ten o'clock.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He hoped he would certainly be able to be there atthat time.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. made an appropriate reply, the Italian shook first thedirector's hand and then K.'s, then the director's again and went to thedoor, half turned to the two men who followed him and continuing to talkwithout a break.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. remained together with the director for a shortwhile, although the director looked especially unhappy today.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Hethought he needed to apologise to K. for something and told him - theywere standing intimately close together - he had thought at first hewould accompany the Italian himself, but then - he gave no more precisereason than this - then he decided it would be better to send K. withhim.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He should not be surprised if he could not understand the Italianat first, he would be able to very soon, and even if he really could notunderstand very much he said it was not so bad, as it was really not soimportant for the Italian to be understood.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And anyway, K.'s knowledgeof Italian was surprisingly good, the director was sure he would get byvery well.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And with that, it was time for K. to go.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He spent the timestill remaining to him with a dictionary, copying out obscure words hewould need to guide the Italian round the cathedral.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was anextremely irksome task, servitors brought him the mail, bank staff camewith various queries and, when they saw that K. was busy, stood by thedoor and did not go away until he had listened to them, the deputydirector did not miss the opportunity to disturb K. and came infrequently, took the dictionary from his hand and flicked through itspages, clearly for no purpose, when the door to the ante-room openedeven clients would appear from the  half darkness and bow timidly to him- they wanted to attract his attention but were not sure whether he hadseen them - all this activity was circling around K. with him at itscentre while he compiled the list of words he would need, then lookedthem up in the dictionary, then wrote them out, then practised theirpronunciation and finally tried to learn them by heart.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The goodintentions he had had earlier, though, seemed to have left himcompletely, it was the Italian who had caused him all this effort andsometimes he became so angry with him that he buried the dictionaryunder some papers firmly intending to do no more preparation, but thenhe realised he could not walk up and down in the cathedral with theItalian without saying a word, so, in an even greater rage, hepulled the dictionary back out again.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At exactly half past nine, just when he was about to leave, therewas a telephone call for him, Leni wished him good morning and asked howhe was, K. thanked her hurriedly and told her it was impossible for himto talk now as he had to go to the cathedral.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""To the cathedral?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
askedLeni.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes, to the cathedral.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""What do you have to go to thecathedral for?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
said Leni.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. tried to explain it to her briefly, buthe had hardly begun when Leni suddenly said, ""They're harassing you.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""One thing that K. could not bear was pity that he had not wanted orexpected, he took his leave of her with two words, but as he put thereceiver back in its place he said, half to himself and half to the girlon the other end of the line who could no longer hear him, ""Yes, they'reharassing me.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
By now the time was late and there was almost a danger he wouldnot be on time.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He took a taxi to the cathedral, at the last moment hehad remembered the album that he had had no opportunity to give to theItalian earlier and so took it with him now.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He held it on his kneesand drummed impatiently on it during the whole journey.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The rain hadeased off slightly but it was still damp chilly and dark, it would bedifficult to see anything in the cathedral but standing about on coldflagstones might well make K.'s chill much worse.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The square in frontof the cathedral was quite empty, K. remembered how even as a smallchild he had noticed that nearly all the houses in this narrow squarehad the curtains at their windows closed most of the time, althoughtoday, with the weather like this, it was more understandable.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Thecathedral also seemed quite empty, of course no-one would think of goingthere on a day like this.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. hurried along both the side naves but sawno-one but an old woman who, wrapped up in a warm shawl, was kneeling ata picture of the Virgin Mary and staring up at it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then, in thedistance, he saw a church official who limped away through a doorway inthe wall.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. had arrived on time, it had struck ten just as he wasentering the building, but the Italian still was not there.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. wentback to the main entrance, stood there indecisively for a while, andthen walked round the cathedral in the rain in case the Italian waswaiting at another entrance.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He was nowhere to be found.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Could thedirector have misunderstood what time they had agreed on?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
How couldanyone understand someone like that properly anyway?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Whatever hadhappened, K. would have to wait for him for at least half an hour.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Ashe was tired he wanted to sit down, he went back inside the cathedral,he found something like a small carpet on one of the steps, he moved itwith his foot to a nearby pew, wrapped himself up tighter in his coat,put the collar up and sat down.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
To pass the time he opened the albumand flicked through the pages a little but soon had to give up as itbecame so dark that when he looked up he could hardly make out anythingin the side nave next to him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In the distance there was a large triangle of candles flickeringon the main altar, K. was not certain whether he had seen them earlier.Perhaps they had only just been lit.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Church staff creep silently aspart of their job, you don't notice them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When K. happened to turnround he also saw a tall, stout candle attached to a column not farbehind him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was all very pretty, but totally inadequate toilluminate the pictures which were usually left in the darkness of theside altars, and seemed to make the darkness all the deeper.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It wasdiscourteous of the Italian not to come but it was also sensible of him,there would have been nothing to see, they would have had to contentthemselves with seeking out a few pictures with K.'s electric pockettorch and looking at them one small part at a time.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. went over to anearby side chapel to see what they could have hoped for, he went up afew steps to a low marble railing and leant over it to look at the altarpicture by the light of his torch.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The eternal light hung disturbinglyin front of it.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
The first thing that K. partly saw and partly guessedat was a large knight in armour who was shown at the far edge of thepainting.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
He was leaning on his sword that he had stuck into the nakedground in front of him where only a few blades of grass grew here andthere.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
He seemed to be paying close attention to something that wasbeing played out in front of him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
It was astonishing to see how hestood there without going any closer.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Perhaps it was his job to standguard.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was a long time since K. had looked at any pictures and hestudied the knight for a long time even though he had continually toblink as he found it difficult to bear the green light of his torch.Then when he moved the light to the other parts of the picture he foundan interment of Christ shown in the usual way, it was also acomparatively new painting.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He put his torch away and went back to hisplace.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There seemed to be no point in waiting for the Italian any longer,but outside it was certainly raining heavily, and as it was not so coldin the cathedral as K. had expected he decided to stay there for thetime being.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Close by him was the great pulpit, there were two plaingolden crosses attached to its little round roof which were lying almostflat and whose tips crossed over each other.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The outside of thepulpit's balustrade was covered in green foliage which continued down tothe column supporting it, little angels could be seen among the leaves,some of them lively and some of them still.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. walked up to the pulpitand examined it from all sides, its stonework had been sculpted withgreat care, it seemed as if the foliage had trapped a deep darknessbetween and behind its leaves and held it there prisoner, K. lay hishand in one of these gaps and cautiously felt the stone, until then hehad been totally unaware of this pulpit's existence.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then K. happenedto notice one of the church staff standing behind the next row of pews,he wore a loose, creased, black cassock, he held a snuff box in his lefthand and he was watching K.  Now what does he want?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
thought K.  Do Iseem suspicious to him?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Does he want a tip?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But when the man in thecassock saw that K. had noticed him he raised his right hand, a pinch ofsnuff still held between two fingers, and pointed in some vaguedirection.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was almost impossible to understand what this behaviourmeant, K. waited a while longer but the man in the cassock did not stopgesturing with his hand and even augmented it by nodding his head.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Nowwhat does he want?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K. quietly, he did not dare call out loudhere; but then he drew out his purse and pushed his way through thenearest pews to reach the man.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He, however, immediately gestured toturn down this offer, shrugged his shoulders and limped away.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
As achild K. had imitated riding on a horse with the same sort of movementas this limp.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""This old man is like a child,"" thought K., ""he doesn'thave the sense for anything more than serving in a church.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Look at theway he stops when I stop, and how he waits to see whether I'llcontinue.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"With a smile, K. followed the old man all the way up theside nave and almost as far as the main altar, all this time the old mancontinued to point at something but K. deliberately avoided lookinground, he was only pointing in order to make it harder for K. to followhim.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Eventually, K. did stop following, he did not want to worry theold man too much, and he also did not want to frighten him awaycompletely in case the Italian turned up after all.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When he entered the central nave to go back to where he had leftthe album, he noticed a small secondary pulpit on a column almost nextto the stalls by the altar where the choir sat.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was very simple,made of plain white stone, and so small that from a distance it lookedlike an empty niche where the statue of a saint ought to have been.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Itcertainly would have been impossible for the priest to take a full stepback from the balustrade, and, although there was no decoration on it,the top of the pulpit curved in exceptionally low so that a man ofaverage height would not be able stand upright and would have to remainbent forward over the balustrade.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In all, it looked as if it had beenintended to make the priest suffer, it was impossible to understand whythis pulpit would be needed as there were also the other ones availablewhich were large and so artistically decorated.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And K. would certainly not have noticed this little pulpit ifthere had not been a lamp fastened above it, which usually meant therewas a sermon about to be given.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
So was a sermon to be given now?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Inthis empty church?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. looked down at the steps which, pressed closeagainst the column, led up to the pulpit.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
They were so narrow theyseemed to be there as decoration on the column rather than for anyone touse.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But under the pulpit - K. grinned in astonishment - there reallywas a priest standing with his hand on the handrail ready to climb thesteps and looking at K.  Then he nodded very slightly, so that K.crossed himself and genuflected as he should have done earlier.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"With alittle swing, the priest went up into the pulpit with short fast steps.Was there really a sermon about to begin?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Maybe the man in the cassockhad not been really so demented, and had meant to lead K.'s way to thepreacher, which in this empty church would have been very necessary.And there was also, somewhere in front of a picture of the Virgin Mary,an old woman who should have come to hear the sermon.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
And if there wasto be a sermon why had it not been introduced on the organ?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
But theorgan remained quiet and merely looked out weakly from the darkness ofits great height.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. now considered whether he should leave as quickly as possible,if he did not do it now there would be no chance of doing so during thesermon and he would have to stay there for as long as it lasted, he hadlost so much time when he should have been in his office, there had longbeen no need for him to wait for the Italian any longer, he looked athis watch, it was eleven.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But could there really be a sermon given?Could K. constitute the entire congregation?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
How could he when he wasjust a stranger who wanted to look at the church?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That, basically, wasall he was.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The idea of a sermon, now, at eleven o'clock, on a workday,in hideous weather, was nonsense.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The priest - there was no doubt thathe was a priest, a young man with a smooth, dark face - was clearlygoing up there just to put the lamp out after somebody had lit it bymistake.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But there had been no mistake, the priest seemed rather to checkthat the lamp was lit and turned it a little higher, then he slowlyturned to face the front and leant down on the balustrade gripping itsangular rail with both hands.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He stood there like that for a while and,without turning his head, looked around.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. had moved back a long wayand leant his elbows on the front pew.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Somewhere in the church - hecould not have said exactly where - he could make out the man in thecassock hunched under his bent back and at peace, as if his work werecompleted.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
In the cathedral it was now very quiet!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But K. would haveto disturb that silence, he had no intention of staying there; if it wasthe priest's duty to preach at a certain time regardless of thecircumstances then he could, and he could do it without K.'s takingpart, and K.'s presence would do nothing to augment the effect of it.So K. began slowly to move, felt his way on tiptoe along the pew,arrived at the broad aisle and went along it without being disturbed,except for the sound of his steps, however light, which rang out on thestone floor and resounded from the vaulting, quiet but continuous at arepeating, regular pace.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. felt slightly abandoned as, probablyobserved by the priest, he walked by himself between the empty pews, andthe size of the cathedral seemed to be just at the limit of what a mancould bear.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
When he arrived back at where he had been sitting he didnot hesitate but simply reached out for the album he had left there andtook it with him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He had nearly left the area covered by pews and wasclose to the  empty space between himself and the exit when, for thefirst time, he heard the voice of the priest.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
A powerful andexperienced voice.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
It pierced through the reaches of the cathedralready waiting for it!,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But the priest was not calling out to thecongregation, his cry was quite unambiguous and there was no escape fromit, he called ""Josef K.!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K. stood still and looked down at the floor.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In theory he wasstill free, he could have carried on walking, through one of three darklittle wooden doors not far in front of him and away from there.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Itwould simply mean he had not understood, or that he had understood butchose not to pay attention to it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But if he once turned round he wouldbe trapped, then he would have acknowledged that he had understoodperfectly well, that he really was the Josef K. the priest had called toand that he was willing to follow.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If the priest had called out againK.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"would certainly have carried on out the door, but everything wassilent as K. also waited, he turned his head slightly as he wanted tosee what the priest was doing now.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He was merely standing in the pulpitas before, but it was obvious that he had seen K. turn his head.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If K.did not now turn round completely it would have been like a childplaying hide and seek.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He did so, and the priest beckoned him with hisfinger.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
As everything could now be done openly he ran - because ofcuriosity and the wish to get it over with - with long flying leapstowards the pulpit.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At the front pews he stopped, but to the priest hestill seemed too far away, he reached out his hand and pointed sharplydown with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
AndK.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"did as he was told, standing in that place he had to bend his head along way back just to see the priest.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You are Josef K.,"" said thepriest, and raised his hand from the balustrade to make a gesture whosemeaning was unclear.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Yes,"" said K., he considered how freely he hadalways given his name in the past, for some time now it had been aburden to him, now there were people who knew his name whom he had neverseen before, it had been so nice first to introduce yourself and onlythen for people to know who you were.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

A man from the countrysidecomes up to the door and asks for entry.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
But the doorkeeper says hecan't let him in to the law right now.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The man thinks about this, andthen he asks if he'll be able to go in later on.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"'That's possible,'says the doorkeeper, 'but not now'.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The gateway to the law is open asit always is, and the doorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the manbends over to try and see in.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"When the doorkeeper notices this helaughs and says, 'If you're tempted give it a try, try and go in eventhough I say you can't.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Careful though: I'm powerful.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
And I'm only thelowliest of all the doormen.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
But there's a doorkeeper for each of therooms and each of them is more powerful than the last.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
It's more than Ican stand just to look at the third one.',Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The man from the country hadnot expected difficulties like this, the law was supposed to beaccessible for anyone at any time, he thinks, but now he looks moreclosely at the doorkeeper in his fur coat, sees his big hooked nose, hislong thin tartar-beard, and he decides it's better to wait until he haspermission to enter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sitdown to one side of the gate.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
He sits there for days and years.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Hetries to be allowed in time and again and tires the doorkeeper with hisrequests.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The doorkeeper often questions him, asking about where he'sfrom and many other things, but these are disinterested questions suchas great men ask, and he always ends up by telling him he still can'tlet him in.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The man had come well equipped for his journey, and useseverything, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He acceptseverything, but as he does so he says, 'I'll only accept this so thatyou don't think there's anything you've failed to do'.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Over many years,the man watches the doorkeeper almost without a break.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He forgets aboutthe other doormen, and begins to think this one is the only thingstopping him from gaining access to the law.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Over the first few years hecurses his unhappy condition out loud, but later, as he becomes old, hejust grumbles to himself.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He becomes senile, and as he has come to knoweven the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar over the years that he hasbeen studying him he even asks them to help him and change thedoorkeeper's mind.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Finally his eyes grow dim, and he no longer knowswhether it's really getting darker or just his eyes that are deceivinghim.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
But he seems now to see an inextinguishable light begin to shinefrom the darkness behind the door.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He doesn't have long to live now.Just before he dies, he brings together all his experience from all thistime into one question which he has still never put to the doorkeeper.He beckons to him, as he's no longer able to raise his stiff body.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Thedoorkeeper has to bend over deeply as the difference in their sizes haschanged very much to the disadvantage of the man.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
'What is it you wantto know now?',Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asks the doorkeeper, 'You're insatiable.'",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"'Everyone wantsaccess to the law,' says the man, 'how come, over all these years, no-one but me has asked to be let in?'",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The doorkeeper can see the man'scome to his end, his hearing has faded, and so, so that he can be heard,he shouts to him: 'Nobody else could have got in this way, as thisentrance was meant only for you.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now I'll go and close it'.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""So the doorkeeper cheated the man,"" said K. immediately, who hadbeen captivated by the story.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Don't be too quick,"" said the priest,""don't take somebody else's opinion without checking it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
I told you thestory exactly as it was written.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There's nothing in there aboutcheating.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""But it's quite clear,"" said K., ""and your firstinterpretation of it was quite correct.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The doorkeeper gave him theinformation that would release him only when it could be of no moreuse.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""He didn't ask him before that,"" said the priest, ""and don'tforget he was only a doorkeeper, and as doorkeeper he did his duty.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""""What makes you think he did his duty?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"asked K., ""He didn't.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It mighthave been his duty to keep everyone else away, but this man is who thedoor was intended for and he ought to have let him in.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You're notpaying enough attention to what was written and you're changing thestory,"" said the priest.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""According to the story, there are twoimportant things that the doorkeeper explains about access to the law,one at the beginning, one at the end.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At one place he says he can'tallow him in now, and at the other he says this entrance was intendedfor him alone.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
If one of the statements contradicted the other youwould be right and the doorkeeper would have cheated the man from thecountry.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
But there is no contradiction.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the contrary, the firststatement even hints at the second.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
You could almost say the doorkeeperwent beyond his duty in that he offered the man some prospect of beingadmitted in the future.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Throughout the story, his duty seems to havebeen merely to turn the man away, and there are many commentators whoare surprised that the doorkeeper offered this hint at all, as he seemsto love exactitude and keeps strict guard over his position.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He staysat his post for many years and doesn't close the gate until the veryend, he's very conscious of the importance of his service, as he says,'I'm powerful,' he has respect for his superiors, as he says, 'I'm onlythe lowliest of the doormen', he's not talkative, as through all theseyears the only questions he asks are 'disinterested', he's notcorruptible, as when he's offered a gift he says, 'I'll only accept thisso that you don't think there's anything you've failed to do,' as far asfulfilling his duty goes he can be neither ruffled nor begged, as itsays about the man that, 'he tires the doorkeeper with his requests',even his external appearance suggests a pedantic character, the bighooked nose and the long, thin, black tartar-beard.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
How could anydoorkeeper be more faithful to his duty?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But in the doorkeeper'scharacter there are also other features which might be very useful forthose who seek entry to the law, and when he hinted at some possibilityin the future it always seemed to make it clear that he might even gobeyond his duty.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There's no denying he's a little simple minded, andthat makes him a little conceited.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Even if all he said about his powerand the power of the other doorkeepers and how not even he could bearthe sight of them - I say even if all these assertions are right, theway he makes them shows that he's too simple and arrogant to understandproperly.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The commentators say about this that, 'correct understandingof a matter and a misunderstanding of the same matter are not mutuallyexclusive'.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Whether they're right or not, you have to concede that hissimplicity and arrogance, however little they show, do weaken hisfunction of guarding the entrance, they are defects in the doorkeeper'scharacter.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"You also have to consider that the doorkeeper seems to befriendly by nature, he isn't always just an official.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He makes a jokeright at the beginning, in that he invites the man to enter at the sametime as maintaining the ban on his entering, and then he doesn't sendhim away but gives him, as it says in the text, a stool to sit on andlets him stay by the side of the door.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The patience with which he putsup with the man's requests through all these years, the littlequestioning sessions, accepting the gifts, his politeness when he putsup with the man cursing his fate even though it was the doorkeeper whocaused that fate - all these things seem to want to arouse our sympathy.Not every doorkeeper would have behaved in the same way.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And finally,he lets the man beckon him and he bends deep down to him so that he canput his last question.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There's no more than some slight impatience -the doorkeeper knows everything's come to its end - shown in the words,'You're insatiable'.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There are many commentators who go even further inexplaining it in this way and think the words, 'you're insatiable' arean expression of friendly admiration, albeit with some condescension.However you look at it the figure of the doorkeeper comes outdifferently from how you might think.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""You know the story better thanI do and you've known it for longer,"" said K.  They were silent for awhile.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And then K. said, ""So you think the man was not cheated, doyou?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Don't get me wrong,"" said the priest, ""I'm just pointing out thedifferent opinions about it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
You shouldn't pay too much attention topeople's opinions.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The text cannot be altered, and the various opinionsare often no more than an expression of despair over it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There's evenone opinion which says it's the doorkeeper who's been cheated.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Thatdoes seem to take things too far,"" said K.  ""How can they argue thedoorkeeper has been cheated?""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Their argument,"" answered the priest,""is based on the simplicity of the doorkeeper.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They say the doorkeeperdoesn't know the inside of the law, only the way into it where he justwalks up and down.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They see his ideas of what's inside the law asrather childish, and suppose he's afraid himself of what he wants tomake the man frightened of.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Yes, he's more afraid of it than the man,as the man wants nothing but to go inside the law, even after he's heardabout the terrible doormen there, in contrast to the doorkeeper whodoesn't want to go in, or at least we don't hear anything about it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Onthe other hand, there are those who say he must have already been insidethe law as he has been taken on into its service and that could onlyhave been done inside.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That can be countered by supposing he could havebeen given the job of doorkeeper by somebody calling out from inside,and that he can't have gone very far inside as he couldn't bear thesight of the third doorkeeper.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Nor, through all those years, does thestory say the doorkeeper told the man anything about the inside, otherthan his comment about the other doorkeepers.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He could have beenforbidden to do so, but he hasn't said anything about that either.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Allthis seems to show he doesn't know anything about what the inside lookslike or what it means, and that that's why he's being deceived.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Buthe's also being deceived by the man from the country as he's this man'ssubordinate and doesn't know it.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There's a lot to indicate that hetreats the man as his subordinate, I expect you remember, but those whohold this view would say it's very clear that he really is hissubordinate.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Above all, the free man is superior to the man who has toserve another.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now, the man really is free, he can go wherever hewants, the only thing forbidden to him is entry into the law and, what'smore, there's only one man forbidding him to do so - the doorkeeper.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Ifhe takes the stool and sits down beside the door and stays there all hislife he does this of his own free will, there's nothing in the story tosay he was forced to do it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"On the other hand, the doorkeeper is keptto his post by his employment, he's not allowed to go away from it andit seems he's not allowed to go inside either, not even if he wanted to.Also, although he's in the service of the law he's only there for thisone entrance, therefore he's there only in the service of this one manwho the door's intended for.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
This is another way in which he's hissubordinate.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"We can take it that he's been performing this somewhatempty service for many years, through the whole of a man's life, as itsays that a man will come, that means someone old enough to be a man.That means the doorkeeper will have to wait a long time before hisfunction is fulfilled, he will have to wait for as long as the manliked, who came to the door of his own free will.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Even the end of thedoorkeeper's service is determined by when the man's life ends, so thedoorkeeper remains his subordinate right to the end.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"And it's pointedout repeatedly that the doorkeeper seems to know nothing of any of this,although this is not seen as anything remarkable, as those who hold thisview see the doorkeeper as deluded in a way that's far worse, a waythat's to do with his service.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"At the end, speaking about the entrancehe says, 'Now I'll go and close it', although at the beginning of thestory it says the door to the law is open as it always is, but if it'salways open - always - that means it's open independently of thelifespan of the man it's intended for, and not even the doorkeeper willbe able to close it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There are various opinions about this, some saythe doorkeeper was only answering a question or showing his devotion toduty or, just when the man was in his last moments, the doorkeeperwanted to cause him regret and sorrow.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
There are many who agree that hewouldn't be able to close the door.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"They even believe, at the end atleast, the doorkeeper is aware, deep down, that he's the man'ssubordinate, as the man sees the light that shines out of the entry tothe law whereas the doorkeeper would probably have his back to it andsays nothing at all to show there's been any change.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""That is wellsubstantiated,"" said K., who had been repeating some parts of thepriest's explanation to himself in a whisper.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""It is wellsubstantiated, and now I too think the doorkeeper must have beendeceived.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Although that does not mean I've abandoned what I thoughtearlier as the two versions are, to some extent, not incompatible.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
It'snot clear whether the doorkeeper sees clearly or is deceived.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
I saidthe man had been cheated.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"If the doorkeeper understands clearly, thenthere could be some doubt about it, but if the doorkeeper has beendeceived then the man is bound to believe the same thing.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"That wouldmean the doorkeeper is not a cheat but so simple-minded that he ought tobe dismissed from his job immediately; if the doorkeeper is mistaken itwill do him no harm but the man will be harmed immensely.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Thereyou've found another opinion,"" said the priest, ""as there are many whosay the story doesn't give anyone the right to judge the doorkeeper.However he might seem to us he is still in the service of the law, so hebelongs to the law, so he's beyond what man has a right to judge.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Inthis case we can't believe the doorkeeper is the man's subordinate.Even if he has to stay at the entrance into the law his service makeshim incomparably more than if he lived freely in the world.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The man hascome to the law for the first time and the doorkeeper is already there.He's been given his position by the law, to doubt his worth would be todoubt the law.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I can't say I'm in complete agreement with this view,""said K. shaking his head, ""as if you accept it you'll have to acceptthat everything said by the doorkeeper is true.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But you've alreadyexplained very fully that that's not possible.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""No,"" said the priest,""you don't need to accept everything as true, you only have to accept itas necessary.""",Franz Kafka,The Trial

K. said that as if it were his final word but it was not hisconclusion.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He was too tired to think about all the ramifications ofthe story, and the sort of thoughts they led him into were not familiarto him, unrealistic things, things better suited for officials of thecourt to discuss than for him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The simple story had lost its shape, hewanted to shake it off, and the priest who now felt quite compassionateallowed this and accepted K.'s remarks without comment, even though hisview was certainly very different from K.'s.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In silence, they carried on walking for some time, K. stayed closebeside the priest without knowing where he was.",Franz Kafka,The Trial

"When K. noticed that, he stopped, which meant the others had tostop too; they were at the edge of an open square, devoid of people butdecorated with flower beds.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Why did they send you, of all people!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"hecried out, more a shout than a question.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The two gentleman clearly knewno answer to give, they waited, their free arms hanging down, likenurses when the patient needs to rest.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I will go no further,"" said K.as if to see what would happen.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The gentlemen did not need to make anyanswer, it was enough that they did not loosen their grip on K. andtried to move him on, but K. resisted them.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""I'll soon have no need ofmuch strength, I'll use all of it now,"" he thought.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
He thought of theflies that tear their legs off struggling to get free of the flypaper.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""These gentleman will have some hard work to do"".",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Just then, Miss BÃ¼rstner came up into the square in front of themfrom the steps leading from a small street at a lower level.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was notcertain that it was her, although the similarity was, of course, great.But it did not matter to K. whether it was certainly her anyway, he justbecame suddenly aware that there was no point in his resistance.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Therewould be nothing heroic about it if he resisted, if he now causedtrouble for these gentlemen, if in defending himself he sought to enjoyhis last glimmer of life.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He started walking, which pleased thegentlemen and some of their pleasure conveyed itself to him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Now theypermitted him to decide which direction they took, and he decided totake the direction that followed the young woman in front of them, notso much because he wanted to catch up with her, nor even because hewanted to keep her in sight for as long as possible, but only so that hewould not forget the reproach she represented for him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""The only thingI can do now,"" he said to himself, and his thought was confirmed by theequal length of his own steps with the steps of the two others, ""theonly thing I can do now is keep my common sense and do what's neededright till the end.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I always wanted to go at the world and try and dotoo much, and even to do it for something that was not too cheap.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Thatwas wrong of me.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Should I now show them I learned nothing from facingtrial for a year?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Should I go out like someone stupid?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Should I letanyone say, after I'm gone, that at the start of the proceedings Iwanted to end them, and that now that they've ended I want to start themagain?",Franz Kafka,The Trial
I don't want anyone to say that.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"I'm grateful they sent theseunspeaking, uncomprehending men to go with me on this journey, and thatit's been left up to me to say what's necessary"".",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Meanwhile, the young woman had turned off into a side street, butK.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
could do without her now and let his companions lead him.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"All threeof them now, in complete agreement, went over a bridge in the light ofthe moon, the two gentlemen were willing to yield to each littlemovement made by K. as he moved slightly towards the edge and directedthe group in that direction as a single unit.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The moonlight glitteredand quivered in the water, which divided itself around a small islandcovered in a densely-piled mass of foliage and trees and bushes.Beneath them, now invisible, there were gravel paths with comfortablebenches where K. had stretched himself out on many summer's days.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Ididn't actually want to stop here,"" he said to his companions, shamed bytheir compliance with his wishes.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Behind K.'s back one of them seemedto quietly criticise the other for the misunderstanding about stopping,and then they went on.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
They went on up through several streets wherepolicemen were walking or standing here and there; some in the distanceand then some very close.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"One of them with a bushy moustache, his handon the  grip of his sword, seemed to have some purpose in approachingthe group, which was hardly unsuspicious.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The two gentlemen stopped,the policeman seemed about to open his mouth, and then K. drove hisgroup forcefully forward.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Several times he looked back cautiously tosee if the policeman was following; but when they had a corner betweenthemselves and the policeman K. began to run, and the two gentlemen,despite being seriously short of breath, had to run with him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"In this way they quickly left the built up area and foundthemselves in the fields which, in this part of town, began almostwithout any transition zone.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"There was a quarry, empty and abandoned,near a building which was still like those in the city.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Here the menstopped, perhaps because this had always been their destination orperhaps because they were too exhausted to run any further.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Here theyreleased their hold on K., who just waited in silence, and took theirtop hats off while they looked round the quarry and wiped the sweat offtheir brows with their handkerchiefs.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The moonlight lay everywhere withthe natural peace that is granted to no other light.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"After exchanging a few courtesies about who was to carry out thenext tasks - the gentlemen did not seem to have been allocated specificfunctions - one of them went to K. and took his coat, his waistcoat, andfinally his shirt off him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"K. made an involuntary shiver, at which thegentleman gave him a gentle, reassuring tap on the back.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then hecarefully folded the things up as if they would still be needed, even ifnot in the near future.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He did not want to expose K. to the chillynight air without moving though, so he took him under the arm and walkedup and down with him a little way while the other gentleman looked roundthe quarry for a suitable place.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
When he had found it he made a signand the other gentleman escorted him there.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"It was near the rockface,there was a stone lying there that had broken loose.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
The gentlemen satK.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"down on the ground, leant him against the stone and settled his headdown on the top of it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Despite all the effort they went to, and despiteall the co-operation shown by K., his demeanour seemed very forced andhard to believe.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"So one of the gentlemen asked the other to grant him ashort time while he put K. in position by himself, but even that didnothing to make it better.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
In the end they left K. in a position thatwas far from the best of the ones they had tried so far.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"Then one ofthe gentlemen opened his frock coat and from a sheath hanging on a beltstretched across his waistcoat he withdrew a long, thin, double-edgedbutcher's knife which he held up in the light to test its sharpness.The repulsive courtesies began once again, one of them passed the knifeover K. to the other, who then passed it back over K. to the first.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
K.now knew it would be his duty to take the knife as it passed from handto hand above him and thrust it into himself.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But he did not do it,instead he twisted his neck, which was still free, and looked around.He was not able to show his full worth, was not able to take all thework from the official bodies, he lacked the rest of the strength heneeded and this final shortcoming was the fault of whoever had denied itto him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As he looked round, he saw the top floor of the building nextto the quarry.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"He saw how a light flickered on and the two halves of awindow opened out, somebody, made weak and thin by the height and thedistance, leant suddenly far out from it and stretched his arms out evenfurther.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Who was that?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
A friend?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
A good person?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Somebody who wastaking part?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Somebody who wanted to help?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Was he alone?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Was iteveryone?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Would anyone help?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Were there objections that had beenforgotten?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
There must have been some.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"The logic cannot be refuted, butsomeone who wants to live will not resist it.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
Where was the judge he'dnever seen?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
Where was the high court he had never reached?,Franz Kafka,The Trial
He raisedboth hands and spread out all his fingers.,Franz Kafka,The Trial
"But the hands of one of the gentleman were laid on K.'s throat,while the other pushed the knife deep into his heart and twisted itthere, twice.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"As his eyesight failed, K. saw the two gentlemen cheek bycheek, close in front of his face, watching the result.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"""Like a dog!""",Franz Kafka,The Trial
"hesaid, it was as if the shame of it should outlive him.",Franz Kafka,The Trial
