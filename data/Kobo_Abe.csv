"MY NICKNAME IS PIG—OR MOLEOnce a month I go shopping downtown, near the prefectural offices.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It takes me the better part of an hour to drive there, but since my purchases include a lot of specialized items—faucet packing, spare blades for power tools, large laminated dry cells, that sort of thing—the local shops won’t do.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, I’d rather not run into anyone I know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My nickname trails after me like a shadow.My nickname is Pig—or Mole.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I stand five feet eight inches tall, weigh two hundred fifteen pounds, and have round shoulders and stumpy arms and legs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Once, hoping to make myself more inconspicuous, I took to wearing a long black raincoat—but any hope I might have had was swept away when I walked by the new city hall complex on the broad avenue leading up to the station.The city hall building is a black steel frame covered with black glass, like a great black mirror; you have to pass it to get to the train station.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With that raincoat on, I looked like a whale calf that had lost its way, or a discarded football, blackened from lying in the trash.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Although the distorted reflection of my surroundings was amusing, my own twisted image seemed merely pitiful.Besides, in hot weather the crease in my double chin perspires so much that I break out in a rash; I can’t very well cool the underside of my chin against a stone wall the way I can my forehead or the soles of my feet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I even have trouble sleeping.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A raincoat is simply out of the question.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My reclusion deepens.If I must have a nickname, let it be Mole, not Pig.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Mole is not only the less unappealing of the two but also more fitting: for the last three years or so I’ve been living underground.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not in a cylindrical cave like a mole’s burrow but in a former quarry for architectural stone, with vertical walls and level ceilings and floors.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The place is a vast underground complex where thousands of people could live, with over seventy stone rooms piled up every which way, all interconnected by stone stairways and tunnels.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
In size the rooms range from great halls like indoor stadiums to tiny cubby-holes where they used to take test samples.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Of course there are no amenities like piped water or drainage, or power lines.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No shops, no police station, no post office.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The sole inhabitant is me.And so Mole will do for a name, at least until something better suggests itself.When I go out I always take along a supply of two items: a key to the quarry entrance and a small card with a map on the back and the words “Boarding Pass—Ticket to Survival” on the front.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Late last year I picked up thirty-five leather cases, and put one key and one card in each.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I keep three in the pocket of my good pants.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If I happen to come across any suitable candidates for my crew, I can invite them aboard on the spot.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve been ready for the last six months now, but the right sort of person has yet to appear.Preparations for sailing are virtually complete; in fact, all I lack now is the crew.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Despite the urgency of the situation, however, I have no intention of conducting any recruiting campaigns.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Why should I?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In payment for their labors, crew members will receive a gift of incalculable value—the gift of life itself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Were this known, I would be swamped with applicants.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Just keeping order would be a problem.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Call it an excuse for my retiring ways if you like, but I’ve always felt that eventually the right people will gravitate to me without my having to go search them out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So you see that whether I have any shopping to do or not, it is essential that I go out once a month or so to mingle with the crowds, come in contact with people, and make my observations.Ordinarily I use the outdoor parking lot next to the prefectural offices, because the rates are low and it always has plenty of parking space.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But today I decided to park underground, beneath the department store across from the station.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The notice on a banner hanging from the roof caught my eye: WONDERS AND CURIOSITIES NEVER SEEN BEFORE!EXHIBITION AND SPOT SALE OF FAMILYHEIRLOOMS AND TREASURESThis was obvious hype, but it succeeded in arousing my interest.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Also, I wanted a look at the customers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When I entered the store, an announcement was being made to the effect that members of the general public were offering rarities and curios from their private collections for sale at the rooftop bazaar.Evidently I wasn’t the only one attracted; almost everyone in the elevator was headed for the roof.I discovered that the entire rooftop was covered with a maze of some hundred or more stalls.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was like a festival or a fairground; a great tangle of people filled the aisles, some hurrying along, others hesitating in apparent bewilderment.Among the items available were these:Key chains made of owl talons.A “bear’s ass-scratcher,” looking something like dried seaweed.This was apparently a kind of parasitic plant; the seller himself had no idea what to do with it.A cardboard box filled with assorted springs and cogwheels.Three sets of horses’ teeth.An old-fashioned inhalator, heated by using an alcohol lamp.A sharpener for bamboo gramophone needles.Two whale turds, each a foot in diameter.Glass nails.Ointment to rub on the trunk of an elephant with a cold; made in Singapore.A bloodstained signal flag claimed by its owner to have been used in the Battle of the Japan Sea.An adjustable ring with plastic ballpoint pen attached.A sleep-inducing device to plug into your home computer; worn around the ankle, it applied rhythmic stimulation timed to the user’s heartbeat.A jar of sixty-five-year-old shochu, low-class distilled spirits (“Drink at your own risk”).An aluminum-can compressor, utilizing water pressure in accordance with the lever principle.A privately printed telephone directory purporting to contain“all you need to know” (for residents of Nerima Ward, Tokyo).3.3 pounds of powdered banana peel (a marijuana substitute?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
").A stuffed sewer rat, nineteen inches long.A baby doll that could suck on a bottle.And then—the eupcaccia.Camped somewhere in the heart of the maze was a stall with a display of insect specimens.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The stallkeeper must have had in mind schoolchildren with vacation bug-collecting assignments to complete, but his display was devoid of popular items like butterflies and giant beetles.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Several dozen little containers about the size of a pack of cigarettes lay heaped in the center of the counter, and that was all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Each was made of transparent acrylic plastic, and each appeared empty.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Aluminum foil labels bore the name “Eupcaccia,” neatly typed, with the Japanese name in parentheses beneath: tokeimushi—clockbug.The containers appeared empty only because their contents were so unimposing: what was inside looked like a relative of one of those nameless bugs that crawl through garbage, unnoticed and unloved.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The salesman himself cut no great figure.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His glasses had lenses like the bottoms of two Coke bottles, and the crown of his head bulged.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All in all, a dour-looking fellow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Somewhat to my relief, he had customers to occupy him: a man and a young woman, both sensible-looking types, were turning containers over in their hands and studying them as they listened to the salesman’s pitch.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I couldn’t help pausing to listen in, attracted as much by the authentic ring of “eupcaccia” as by the intriguing nickname, “clockbug.”I learned that in Epichamaic, the language spoken on Epicham Island (the insect’s native habitat), eupcaccia is the word for “clock.” Half an inch long, the insect is of the order Coleoptera, and has a stubby black body lined with vertical brown stripes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Its only other distinguishing feature is its lack of legs, those appendages having atrophied because the insect has no need to crawl about in search of food.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It thrives on a peculiar diet—its own feces.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The idea of ingesting one’s own waste products for nourishment sounds about as ill-advised as trying to start a fire from ashes; the explanation lies, it seems, in the insect’s extremely slow rate of consumption, which allows plenty of time for the replenishment of nutrients by bacterial action.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Using its round abdomen as a fulcrum, the eupcaccia pushes itself around counterclockwise with its long, sturdy antennae, eating as it eliminates.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As a result, the excrement always lies in a perfect half-circle.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It begins ingesting at dawn and ceases at sunset, then sleeps till morning.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Since its head always points in the direction of the sun, it also functions as a timepiece.For a long time, islanders resisted mechanical clocks, deterred by the clockwise rotation, and by what appeared to them the suspiciously simple movements of hands measuring off the passage of time in equal units, without regard for the position of the sun.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even now it seems they refer to mechanical clocks as eupcanu, to distinguish them from “real” clocks— eupcaccia.There was a charm to the unassuming eupcaccia that went beyond mere practical concerns.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Perhaps its almost perfectly closed ecosystem was somehow soothing to troubled hearts.Guests at the Hotel Eupcaccia, the only such facility on Epicham, would come across the insects lying on flagstones (thoughtfully provided by the management) and become riveted to the spot.There were reports of a certain businessman who had sat day after day in the same place, magnifying glass in hand, and finally died raving mad, cheeks bulging with his own excrement.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
(He seems to have been either a Japanese watch salesman or a Swiss clock manufacturer.),Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All of this was doubtless more sales talk, but I chose to take it at face value.The native population, in contrast, showed no such obsession with the insect.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Around the start of the rainy season, when tourists went away, the bacterial action so crucial to the well-being of the eupcaccia would fall off, effectively slowing the progress of time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Next came the annual mating season, when time died, as the eupcaccia flew off like clock hands leaving their dials.Then impregnated females crisscrossed clumsily over the ground, fluttering wings as thin as the film on a soap bubble, as they searched for semicircles of dung on which to lay their eggs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The cycle was suspended, time invisible.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The clocks shorn of hands were like claw marks on the surface of the ground, lifeless and sinister.For all this, the islanders have never rejected time itself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The signs of regeneration are always the same.I couldn’t help marveling at the uncanny resemblance that the eupcaccia bore to me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was as if someone were deliberately making fun of me, yet this insect dealer had no possible way of knowing who I was.The male customer spoke, after clucking his tongue like someone sucking on a sour plum.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Funny kind of bug,” he said.“Looks to me like it’s sulking in there.” His speech was unpleasantly moist, as if his salivary glands were working overtime.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The girl looked up at him and said—her voice dry, the voice of someone sucking on a sugar candy—“Oh, let’s get one.They’re so cute.”She smiled prettily, dimpling the corners of her naturally red lips.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The man stuck out his jaw and produced his wallet with an exaggerated flourish.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All at once I decided to buy one too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I felt a strong sense of intimacy with the bug—the sort of feeling aroused by the smell of your own sweat.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Fastened with a pin, I would doubtless make just as novel a specimen.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Whether the price of twenty thousand yen was high or low I couldn’t say, but I had a strange conviction that I had found exactly what I’d been looking for.The eupcaccia was suspended inside its transparent acrylic container on two fine nylon threads hung at right angles, to make it visible from below as well as above.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Without the clear vestiges of atrophied legs, it could have been a dung beetle with the legs torn off.I paid my money after the couple paid theirs, and watched as the salesman inserted tablets of a drying agent into the top and bottom of the container.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then, slipping it in my pocket, I felt a great easing of tension, like stepping into a pair of comfortable old shoes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“How many does this make?” I asked.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“That you’ve sold today, I mean.”As if the question somehow offended him, the salesman kept his mouth clamped shut.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His gaze was refracted in the thick lenses, making his expression hard to read.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was he just ignoring me, or had he not heard?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Cheerful background music rose and fell with a passing breeze.“As soon as I get home I’m going to get out my atlas and see if there really is such a place as Epicham Island,” I said, and then laughed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Just kidding.” Still no reaction.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Maybe I had gone too far.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I hesitated to say anything more.2SOMEDAY I’D LIKE TO DESIGNA LOGO BASED ON THE EUPCACCIA,AND USE IT FOR A GROUP FLAGStraight back from the entrance was a canvas-roofed rest area that probably doubled as a stage for outdoor concerts.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Next to stands selling iced coffee and hamburgers was one selling shaved ice; I ordered a bowlful, flavored with syrupy adzuki beans.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Seen through the protective wire-mesh fence, the dusty streets below looked like old torn fishnet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It seemed about to rain: mountains in the distance were swathed in clouds.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The noise of thousands of car engines bounced off the sky and merged, interfering with the department-store Muzak in spurts like the gasps of a winded bullfrog.The bowl of shaved ice and sweet purplish beans chilled my palms.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"People in the unroofed area were starting to head for the exits, but here nearly every seat was filled.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I shared a table with a student (so I judged him to be from the long hair that fell to the nape of his slender neck, and his bloodshot eyes) wearing a dark blue T-shirt with white lettering that read PO PO PO.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His face was bent over a bowl of chilled noodles.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I crushed the beans in my ice with the back of my spoon, then scooped them up and ate them.The student looked up with a sound of joints cracking in his neck.Evidently he was offended by the critical gaze I had turned on him.It’s a bad habit I’ve developed ever since I started carrying the boarding passes with me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As I go out only once a month, I have to make the most of my time.“Did you find anything?” I asked.“Nah.” A noodle hung down on his chin; he pushed it into his mouth with a finger and added in a tone of disgust, “What a bunch of junk.”“Even the eupcaccia?”“The what?”“Eupcaccia.” I pulled the plastic case out of my pocket and showed it to him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It’s the name of an insect.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Didn’t you see it?Second aisle from the back, around the middle, on the left.”“What’s so great about it?”“It’s a beetle, a kind of Coleopteron.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The legs have atrophied, and it goes around and around in the same place like the hour hand of a clock, feeding on its own excrement.”“So?”“So isn’t that interesting?”“Not especially.”So much for him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Disqualified.At the risk of sounding pretentious, let me say I believe the eupcaccia is symbolic of a certain philosophy or way of life: However much you may move around, as long as the motion is circular you haven’t really gone anywhere; the important thing is to maintain a tranquil inner core.Someday, I thought, I’d like to design a logo based on the eupcaccia, for a group flag.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It would have to be based on the back, not the belly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The segmented belly has too many lines, like the underside of a dried shrimp, but the back could be represented easily enough by two adjacent ovals.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Sort of like the radiator grille on a BMW—the car with the world’s top driving performance.That settled it: I knew now where I was going to keep the eupcaccia.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There could be no better place than the shelf over the toilet in my work area.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That was where I kept all the luggage and other travel equipment.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Suddenly I grinned, my humor restored at the notion of the eupcaccia as a travel accessory.The student went off with a look of uneasiness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I had no intention of stopping him.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even apart from his boorish way of slurping his noodles, his approach to life was obviously wanting in gravity.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The eupcaccia promised to become a useful litmus test, I thought, one that gave me an objective standard for deciding among potential crewmen.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Anyone who showed no curiosity about such an insect—the fulcrum of a compass with which to draw the circumference of the very earth—was simply too insensitive to merit serious consideration.I felt far greater interest in the young couple who had bought a eupcaccia before me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Where could they have gone?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They were the ones I should have sounded out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Why did I never make the most of my opportunities?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On second thought, however, the man anyway was no loss.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He had been too restless, as if there were a Ping-Pong game going on inside his head.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Hardly the type to adapt well to the life of a mole.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The girl was another matter; she certainly would bear careful investigation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It had been her idea to buy the eupcaccia; besides, it was only logical that my first crew member should be a woman.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Savoring the coldness of the ice in my mouth, I turned regretful thoughts of her over in my mind.Why hadn’t I spoken up right then?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"By now we might have been fast friends, based on our mutual interest in the eupcaccia.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The only problem was the nature of her relationship with that man.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If they were married, or anything like it, my hopes were wasted.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Of course the eupcaccia itself belonged to the realm of soliloquy.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was hardly the sort of thing you’d expect a married couple to purchase together.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On the other hand, I had to admit that unmarried couples who behave like man and wife are rare—far rarer than married couples who behave like mutual strangers.Time to go.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had already had the amazing good fortune to stumble on the eupcaccia; it wouldn’t do to be greedy for more.And on a windy day like this I couldn’t drive after dark along that rocky ledge by the coast: salt spray would rust out the body of the jeep.A shadow fell on the seat just vacated by the student.Conspicuously large cranium, heavy glasses for nearsightedness, dingy skin—it was the insect salesman.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He unwrapped a sandwich and dragged a chair up, scraping it loudly against the floor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He still hadn’t seen me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It wasn’t an amazing coincidence that we should end up face to face, considering there were only a few seats vacant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He peeled off the top slice of bread from his sandwich, rolled it up into a cylinder, and began to take careful bites, sipping now and then from a can of coffee.“Taking a break?” I said.The insect dealer stopped chewing and looked up slowly.“You talking to me?”“Don’t you remember me?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You just sold me a eupcaccia a few minutes ago.”For several seconds he continued to stare at me silently, through lenses so thick they seemed bulletproof.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He seemed wary.Was it my weight?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"People tend to equate obesity with imbecility.Members of the opposite sex are distant, those of one’s own sex derisive.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Fat is even an obstacle to finding employment.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The ratio of body size to brain size suggests unflattering analogies to whales and dinosaurs.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I don’t even like fat people myself—despite the obvious irony—and I generally avoid getting into conversations with them if I can help it.“What’s the matter?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You want your money back, is that it?” In the back of my mind I still had reservations about the eupcaccia, but I didn’t want them forced into the open.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was in no mood to hear a confession.“Not at all.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m very happy with my eupcaccia.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s given me a lot to think about.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Did you collect all those specimens yourself ?They say environmental pollution is getting so bad that insects are disappearing all over the place.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Some dealers have to raise their own, I’ve heard.”“Yes, and some go even further—they conjure up nonexistent specimens with tweezers and glue, I’ve heard.”“How many have you sold altogether?” I asked, deeming it safest to change the subject.“One.”“No, really.”“Look, if you want your money back, I don’t mind.”“Why do you say that?”“To avoid a hassle.”“There were some other people who bought one before me.”“No, there weren’t.”“Yes, there were.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Don’t you remember?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A man and a young woman.”“You haven’t been around much, have you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I hired them as sakura— decoys, shills, to lure customers.”“They looked on the level to me.”“Well, they have a standing contract with the department store, so they’re in a little better class than your average confidence man.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, the girl is terrific.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She makes great cover.”“She had me fooled.”“She’s a looker, all right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She’s got real class.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That son of a gun .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“There’s a new system for classifying women into types,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I saw it in the paper.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The ‘quintuple approach,’ I think it was called.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"According to that, women fall into five main types—Mother, Housewife, Wife, Woman, and Human Being.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Which one would you say she is?”“That sort of thing doesn’t interest me.”“It’s all been carefully researched by a top ad agency.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s some new tool they’ve worked out for market analysis, so it should be fairly reliable.”“You believe that stuff ?”A flock of sparrows flew low overhead.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then came a rain-cloud that brushed the department store rooftop as it sped by in pursuit.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Canvas flaps over the stalls fluttered and snapped in the wind; shoppers paused uncertainly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Here and there some stallkeepers were already closing up.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They would be the ones whose goods were sold out, or who had given up on selling any more that day.“Shouldn’t you be getting back to your stall?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Looks like rain.”“I’ve quit.” He laid thin slices of ham and tomato on top of each other, speared them with a fork, and grinned.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His boyish grin went surprisingly well with his bald head.“Don’t give up so soon,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The eupcaccia gives people something to dream about; I’m sure you can sell at least a couple more if you try.”“You’re weird, you know that?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What do you do for a living, anyway?” He stroked his head with hairy fingers until the smokelike wisps of hair lay flat against his scalp, making the top of his head look even bigger.A customer wandered up to the stall next to the rest area where we were sitting.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The item for sale there was an all-purpose vibrator, oval in shape, featuring a metal fitting for an electric drill on the end, in which a variety of tools could be inserted: back scratcher, toothbrush, facial sponge, wire brush, shoulder massager, small hammer .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
you name it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It certainly was ingenious, yet it failed to fire the imagination.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, there at the counter they had only samples.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To make a purchase you had to go through some fishy rigmarole, leaving a ten percent deposit and filling out an order blank with your name and address; the device would supposedly be delivered to your doorstep (for a slight charge) within a week.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I found it hard to see why anyone would want to buy such a thing.“There you have the opposite of a dream,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Sheer practicality.”“There you have a lesson in how to fleece people,” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Nothing wild or fantastic, you see.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Plain, everyday items are best—kitchen stuff, especially.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you’re clever, you can even fool people in the same line.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But it doesn’t bear repeating.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You can never work the same place, or the same item, more than once.And until you’ve mapped out your next strategy, you’ve got to keep jumping from town to town.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not an easy life.”“Does the eupcaccia bear repeating?” I asked.“Ah—so now you’ve made up your mind it’s a fake.”“Just eat your sandwich, please.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What did you have for breakfast?”“What does it matter?”“I always have sweet potatoes, or pancakes, with coffee.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I make my own pancakes.”“I can’t make a good pancake.”“Neither can I.”“Haven’t eaten breakfast in a good ten years.”“Was that thunder?”“Who cares?”He bit off a piece of his sandwich as if tearing into the world’s betrayal.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I couldn’t blame him.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If I were the discoverer of the eupcaccia, with sales so slow I’d undoubtedly feel the same way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A pillar of sand, understood only by dreamers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But even a pillar of sand, if it stands inside the earth, can hold up a skyscraper.“If you like, I’ll take the rest of the eupcaccias off your hands.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Another four or five wouldn’t hurt, anyway.”“Why should you do that?” the insect dealer said, stuffing his mouth with the last of his sandwich.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Don’t talk like an idiot.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I don’t know what little scheme you may have in mind .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”“All right.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just because I’m fat, you don’t have to snap at me that way.”“Obesity has no correlation to character.” He stuck the wad of bread he was chewing over on one side of his mouth, and added in a muffled voice, “It’s caused by the proliferation of melanoid fat cells; only involves an inch or two of subcutaneous tissue.”“You know a lot about it.”“Just something I read in the paper.”“Do you plan to sell the rest of the eupcaccias somewhere else?”“Frankly, I’ve had a bellyful of them.”“Surely you wouldn’t just throw them away?”“They’re not even worth grinding up for medicine.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll save the containers, though; I paid enough for them.”“Then why not let me have the lot?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll trade you that for a boat ticket.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you’re going to throw them away anyway, why not?You’ve got nothing to lose.”Whoops—too soon to bring up the boat ticket.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After this slip, I felt as unnerved as if someone had just goosed me with an ice cube.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’d been too anxious to keep him from belittling my purchase, feeling that any criticism of the eupcaccia was a reflection on my judgment as well.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The clockbug contained, I felt, a revelation that could save humanity much rancor and anxiety.Take the anthropoids, who are thought to share a common ancestor with the human race.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They exhibit two distinct tendencies: one is to make groups and build societies—the aggrandizing tendency—and the other is for each animal to huddle in its own territory and build its own castle—the settling tendency.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For whatever reason, both these contradictory impulses survive in the human psyche.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On the one hand, humans have acquired the ability to spread across the earth, thanks to an adaptability superior even to that of rats and cockroaches; on the other, they have acquired a demonic capability for intense mutual hatred and destruction.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For the human race, now on a level equal with nature, this two-edged sword is too heavy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We end up with government policies that make about as much sense as using a giant electric saw to cut open the belly of a tiny fish.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
If only we could be more like the eupcaccias .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".“Trade it for what, did you say?”“A boat ticket.”“Ah, the old survey con.” He drank the rest of his canned coffee, and looked at me intently through his thick lenses.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If you’re trying to pull off one of those on me, better wait till you’re a little more experienced.”“Huh?”“You never heard of it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I guess not, from the look on your face.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You know, you see them everywhere, those people standing on street corners with a pad of paper and a ballpoint pen in their hands.”“I’ve seen them.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What are they there for?”“ ‘Tell me, madam, have you settled on your summer vacation plans?’ They start out like that, and they wind up extorting an entrance fee for some super-duper travel club.”“You’ve got me wrong.” After some hesitation, I decided I had no choice but to bring out one of the leather cases.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“See?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A key and a boat ticket.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s a ticket to survival.” A tap on the shoulder from behind.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A pungent whiff of pomade.“No soliciting without a permit, buddy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Pay the fee and open your own stall, just like everybody else.” A boxlike man, hair parted on one side, stood looming behind me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His eyes, moist with intensity, were round and deep-set.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His erect posture and the badge on his chest immediately identified him as a member of the store’s security detail.“I’m not soliciting.”“You’ll have to come with me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You can file your complaints over at the office.”Eyes converged on us.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A wall of curiosity, anticipating a show.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then Goggle Eyes grabbed my arm, his fingers digging into the flesh until my wrist began to tingle—a form of punishment he was evidently used to meting out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With my eyes I signaled to the insect dealer for help, expecting him to be able to say something in my defense.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But he kept his head lowered, and did nothing but fumble in his pocket.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The man was all talk, not to be trusted.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Let that be a lesson to me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It wouldn’t do to start passing out tickets recklessly.Resigned, I began to get up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All at once, Goggle Eyes softened his grip.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer’s right arm was extended toward us, displaying in two fingers a tan card.“Permit number E-eighteen.”“That won’t work.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This guy is the one who was soliciting.”“He’s my partner.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Since when is use restricted to the bearer?”“Oh.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Well, in that case .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“I’ll go along with you,” offered the insect dealer genially.“It’s the least I can do.”“No, that’s okay, as long as I know the score.”“Not so fast.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’ve embarrassed us publicly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Now there has to be a proper settling up.”“I am sorry this happened, sir.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But we do ask in principle that you restrict business activities to the place stipulated.”“Yes, certainly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sorry to have troubled you.” Palms facing us in a gesture of apology, Goggle Eyes backed speedily off and disappeared.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was filled with remorse, abashed that for those few seconds I had doubted the insect dealer.“Thanks.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You saved me.”“A lot of those guys are former cops.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Out to fill their quotas.”“Anyway, please take this,” I said, pressing the case on him.“It may not be as fancy as the one for the eupcaccias, but it’s pretty nice, don’t you think?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Real leather, hand-tooled.”“So the case is imposing and the contents are worthless, eh?At least you’re honest.”“No, no—this is a ticket to survival.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Open it up and see for yourself.”“Survival?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Of what?”“The disaster, of course.”“What disaster?”“Well, don’t you think we’re teetering on the brink of disaster right now—nature, mankind, the earth, the whole world?”“As a matter of fact, I do.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But my thinking so isn’t going to make any difference.”“Come on.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll show you.”I stood up and motioned for him to follow, but the insect dealer remained where he was, making no move either to touch the ticket case or to get up from his chair.“It’s just not my line.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Social protest, that sort of thing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m the type who believes in letting things take their course.”“Nobody’s asking you to worry about anyone else.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This is strictly for you yourself.”“Thanks, anyway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I think I’ll pass it up.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Who am I to survive when other people don’t?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Isn’t it a sin to ask for too much?” There was something to what he said.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He had found my vulnerable spot.“Don’t you see, I want to trade you this for the rest of the eupcaccias.”“Some other time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What’s the rush?”“That just shows how little you know.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The disaster is on its way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Don’t you read the papers?”“Oh, yeah?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
When is it coming?”“It could very well be tomorrow.”“Not today?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Tomorrow?”“I’m just talking possibilities.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It could come this very instant, for all I know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All I’m saying is, it won’t be long.”“Want to bet?”“On what?”“On whether it comes in the next ten seconds.” He prepared to start the stopwatch attachment on his wristwatch.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Ten thousand yen says this disaster you’re talking about doesn’t happen.”“I said I’m only talking possibilities.”“I’ll make it the next twenty seconds.”“Either way, it’s a toss-up.”“And in twenty minutes, or two hours, or two days, or two months, or two years, it’ll still be a toss-up, right?”“You mean the whole thing doesn’t interest you unless you can bet on it?”“Don’t be so touchy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I know what you’re thinking: Even if it did come in twenty seconds, winning wouldn’t do you much good because you’d be too dead to collect.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There could be no payoff unless it didn’t come.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not much of a gamble any way you look at it.”“Then why not go ahead and take the ticket?”“What a depressing creature you are.”“Why?”“I just can’t relate to someone who goes around hawking the end of the world.”All right then, smart-ass, go ahead and drop dead if that’s what you want.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That head of yours looks terrific from the outside, but inside it must be stuffed with bean curd.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Probably I overestimated the eupcaccia too.“When you’re sorry, it’ll be too late,” I said.“I’m going to take a leak.”“You’re positive you don’t want it?”The insect dealer began to get up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It wouldn’t do to leave the precious ticket lying there any longer.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My hand started for it, but before I could reach it, he had slid his hand under mine and snatched it up, smiling broadly then as he adjusted his glasses.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He might equally have been seeking reconciliation or merely teasing.“Wait back by the stall.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll be right there.”“Don’t walk out on me, now.”“All my stuff is still there.”“You mean the eupcaccias?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You were going to throw them away, anyway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What kind of a guarantee is that?” He took off his watch and set it where the ticket case had been.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It’s a Seiko Chronograph, brand-new.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Don’t you make off with it.”3THE SHILLS RAN AWAYWITH THE TICKETS TO SURVIVALEverything in the insect dealer’s stall was packed up, backing his assertion that he had decided to quit.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The left-hand stall across the way—I’ve forgotten what it was selling—had likewise ceased business.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The sky threatened rain any minute, and the hour was six-twenty—almost closing time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I entered the stall from the side, ducking under the canvas, and found in place of a chair a large suitcase, which doubtless contained the rest of the eupcaccias.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Overly conscious, as always, of the eyes of others, I lowered myself onto the suitcase, shoulders hunched to avoid looking conspicuous.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I needn’t have worried.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The few remaining shoppers went scurrying past like young crabs racing to catch the tide.I transferred the insect dealer’s watch from my back pocket to my shirt pocket.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My spirits were low—not, I thought, solely because of the weather.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was I sorry already that I had let him have the ticket?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With what eagerness I had waited for and dreamed of this event—the finding of a companion—yet now that one had made his appearance, I began shrinking back.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A bad habit.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Must take a more positive view.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He wasn’t a bad fellow in the least.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A bit plain-spoken, but that was better than a lot of high-sounding talk.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Not just anyone could have discovered the eupcaccia.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He was probably a lot more quick-witted than he let on.The first crew member, above all, had to be far more than a mere cabin boy.To erase any doubts, as soon as he came back from the men’s room I could inform him that I was the captain, and have him sign a form stating that once aboard, he agreed unconditionally to obey any orders to disembark.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The ship was mine.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I discovered her, designed her, and built her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was only proper for the crew to fall in line with my policies.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Of course if he had a mind to disobey, no mere signature was going to stop him.In which case I’d have no choice but to put my punitive system into action.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Basically a defense against invaders from outside, the apparatus was capable of inflicting fatal injury; but for communal living to succeed, minimum standards of order had to be preserved.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Certainly I had no plan or desire to throw my weight around as captain, but then again, it wouldn’t do to turn the ark into a great coffin.I couldn’t keep putting off the decision.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Unless I compromised somewhere, plainly I would find myself battling windmills forever.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
One or two people could never run a ship that size; my plans called ultimately for a crew of 385.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Unless I wanted to see the ship superannuated before ever weighing anchor, I had better make up my mind to take the insect dealer on board.The lady directly across the way (whose stall boasted a collection of thousands of different matchbooks and matchboxes, candy wrappers and whatnot) had begun packing in a hurry.Apparently annoyed by the failure of her goods to sell, she was ripping off the tarpaulin and stuffing it into her valise without even taking time to remove the thumbtacks.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was no wonder her sales were poor; the eupcaccia was eccentric in its way, but her merchandise was just too idiosyncratic.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She herself, though past middle age, wore yellow sunglasses with a smart-looking kimono, for an effect somehow out of keeping with the surroundings.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To make matters worse, at the bottom of her sign were the pathetic words “Mementoes of My Departed Husband,” which could only serve to put off potential customers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perhaps the insect dealer had been right: expecting too much was indeed a sin.The man selling a water cannon (not water pistol) at the stall on my immediate right was seated chin in hands by a peculiar machine placed directly on the floor.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A tape recording recited his spiel for him while he looked resentfully up at the sky.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The clouds were higher than before; now a wisp swirled fitfully by at about the speed of a helicopter.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It looked as if the rain would hold off awhile longer, but no one was likely to buy a water cannon in any case.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, the price was too high.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No sane person would part with ten million yen unless either there was solid reason to believe the price would rise further or the item was of enormous practical value.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"From listening to the tape, I deduced that he had based the figure solely on the number of days it had taken him to make the thing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A former employee of the Japan National Railways, he had utilized the principle of the steam locomotive.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He had evidently applied for a patent, but to my layman’s way of thinking it seemed hardly likely that steam pressure could have an explosive force comparable to gunpowder.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If it was a low-noise, nonpolluting, short-distance projectile he wanted, elastic could easily do the job.I didn’t think much of the design, either: an unsightly bulging coal stove, and rising out of it, a stubby cannon.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It looked exactly like the male genitalia.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Good for a laugh maybe, but certainly nothing I’d pay even one hundred yen for.These people were obviously genuine amateurs, just as advertised.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Their offerings roused one’s curiosity, but ultimately left one disappointed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All I could discern around me was out-and-out greed, and total lack of concern for psychology.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Personally, I didn’t mind a little wool over my eyes as long as the result was sufficiently entertaining.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That was where the eupcaccia shone: now there was the unmistakable touch of the professional.A man appeared in the corner of the aisle and stopped lightly, birdlike.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the heat, as sultry as a noodle-shop kitchen, he cut a conspicuous figure in his suit coat.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even without seeing the badge on his lapel, I knew instantly that this was the same security guard who had falsely accused me over at the rest area.Had he come to stir up some new storm?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I didn’t want to be hassled.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With the stall cleared of merchandise, he might well stop to ask questions.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I took out the remaining two tickets and placed them side by side on the counter.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The plain wood surface of the counter, not one meter long, looked immeasurably vast.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No reason to quail, I told myself; those cases held something of far more value than ten thousand stalls.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The guard walked by without a flicker of expression.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The edge of his glance swept over the counter in front of me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sweat was dripping from the point of his chin, I noticed; I too poured rivers of sweat.What was keeping the insect dealer?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This was taking too long.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Did the man have kidney stones?A young couple stopped at the counter.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The man had a crew cut, and he wore black trousers with a white, open-collared shirt.Fastened around his fat, sausagelike neck was a gold necklace.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The woman’s hair was mussed, as if she’d just gone through it with her fingers; she had on purplish lipstick and a T-shirt printed with a loud Hawaiian beach scene.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They had come to the wrong place.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was only putting on an act; I had nothing to sell.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I started to say so, when it hit me—this was her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There could be no doubt about it: she was one of the two other people who had bought, or pretended to buy, a eupcaccia.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The hair and makeup and clothes were all different, but there was no mistaking who she was.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even the insect dealer had mentioned what “class” she had, and indeed she had a striking way about her that no disguise could conceal for long.About the man I was less sure.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was he or was he not the same person?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That long hair before could have been a wig—if she wears disguises, then so does he, I told myself—but still, something didn’t connect.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perhaps offensive people leave a more superficial impression.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Unfortunately, he looked ten years younger than the one before, which made him a good match for her.“Where’s the bug man?” The man slid his fingers over the counter as if testing for dust.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Uncertain how to respond, I stammered, “Uh, probably the men’s room.”“Is he closing up, or just switching merchandise?” His fingers drummed as if hitting a telegraph key.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His voice was raspy and monotonous.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I knew I was under no obligation to answer, yet I did.“Closing up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’s given up on selling the things.”“Why?” Wonderingly, the girl tilted her head on its slender neck.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She reached casually for a ticket.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“They were such cute little bugs.”Had it been the man, I would have reacted differently.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But the girl’s fingers were transparent, as if she had no bones.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There seemed little enough chance that the ticket was in any danger.“Great,” said the man.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“We’re here to collect some money.Can you pay us?”“I’m afraid business was pretty bad.”“Oh, no, it wasn’t.” He raised his voice, as if his professional pride had been wounded.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I saw it with my own eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They were selling, all right.”The girl nodded her head rapidly in agreement.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Her look was intense.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It seemed possible to interpret her reaction as a sincere defense of the eupcaccia—but that was ridiculous.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She was a sakura, a shill; she couldn’t be serious.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It had to be an act, I knew, and yet I couldn’t suppress a rush of affection.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Rather like a cat-hater who finds a kitten purring and rubbing his legs.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Without thinking, I indulged in a bit of small talk, thus inadvertently handing them a pretext to stay.“Don’t you remember me?” I said, burying my chin in the folds of my neck, prickly with heat rash, to emphasize my bulk.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I remember you.”“I remember you too,” said the girl, bringing her hands together.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Her eyes sparkled.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You’re the one who bought the eupcaccia right after us, aren’t you?”“That’s right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That was it; that was the only one he sold.”“What do you mean?” said the man.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“We bought one too, didn’t we?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That makes at least two.”“You can stop pretending.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I know everything.”“Like what?”“Like what you two do for a living.”They looked at each other and laughed nonchalantly.Consternation was apparent beneath the laughter.“What’s your relationship to him?” the man asked.“None.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I just took a fancy to the eupcaccia, that’s all.”“Funny.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Why would he go and leave the store with a total stranger?”“Nature called.”The girl held the ticket case to her ear and shook it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Say, what do you suppose this is?” Her voice was clear and a bit high, with a suggestion of strain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was she flustered at having been found out?“Any bug that thin and flat could only be made out of paper.” His voice was raspy and heavily ironic.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He rotated his right shoulder and cracked his knuckles.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“These days they have to have horns, or the kids won’t buy them.”“Eupcaccias don’t have horns,” I said.“That’s the whole trouble with them.”“It’s something hard,” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Metallic.” Swiftly the man reached out for the remaining case.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over my dead body.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I snatched it up and pocketed it.“Is that nice?” he demanded.“It’s not for sale.”“You don’t mind if I look inside, do you?” The girl glanced up at me inquiringly.“Go on and open it if you want.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s a free country.” The man’s tone was brusque.She shook the contents out onto the counter.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The ornamental brass key fell out with a clatter, while the thin plastic card started to fly away, caught in a puff of wind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The man slammed it down in the nick of time, as if swatting a fly; he shook off my arm, which had shot out simultaneously, and backed off with a mischievous smile.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He seemed bent on playing games.“Well, well, what do we have here?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A boat ticket.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A ‘Ticket to Survival,’ no less.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What do you know.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Looking for people to sign on?”Bouncing the key on her palm, the girl peered at the card in her companion’s hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“There’s a map on the back.” Where was the insect dealer?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No matter how crowded the lavatory might have been, he was taking his sweet time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It had been a good five minutes now.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Wasn’t he ever coming back?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Had he taken such a dislike to me that he was willing to sacrifice both his suitcase and his wristwatch for the chance to escape?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The irony was that these two seemed more interested than he had been.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Maybe it was all for the best.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It wasn’t sour grapes; there was just no reason it had to be the insect dealer and no one else.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I studied the girl, first by herself, then comparing her with her companion.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Had she been alone, I would have welcomed this turn of events unconditionally.“Pardon me for asking, but what exactly are you two to each other?” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Are you business partners, or what?” It was indeed a strange question.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Hearing myself ask it, I wanted to stop up my ears.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The man’s smile faded, and he wiped the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand.“I know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We’re a funny pair, aren’t we?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
People are always asking us that.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Every time they do, I think of the saying ‘Catch big fish with little ones.’ ”“People are always asking you that?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What do you mean.”“This person,” he said, indicating her with a jerk of his head, “seems to radiate loneliness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
As if she were a pitiful waif forced against her will to do nasty men’s bidding.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She stirs up men’s combativeness.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s a kind of fishing by lure, if you follow me.”“This person,” he had said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How much more impersonal could you be?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perhaps there was hope.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or perhaps he was only glorying in his fishing skills.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The sight of him became even more irritating.“Sorry—I don’t go in much for fishing,” I said.Slowly the girl’s smile faded.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She did have an air of loneliness about her, despite her way of glancing up at you, and the lines at either corner of her mouth, and her fairly heavy makeup.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It might well be a look that was carefully contrived and calculated, I thought.“Well, what about this merchandise?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Don’t we at least get an explanation?” He flicked the card with a fingernail and spoke with rising insistency.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You can’t choose your customers; it’s not fair.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Once the goods are on the counter, that’s it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You have to play fair.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The bug man may have told you— half of these stalls are here only because I put in a good word for the owners with the management.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That gives me a certain stake in what goes on here.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can’t have you picking and choosing among customers.”“You don’t understand.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
These aren’t for sale.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s what I’ve been telling you all along.”“Tsk tsk.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The rule is that anything displayed on the counter has to be for sale.”“In that case, I apologize.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m sorry.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Now will you please hand it back?”“The bug man must have told you some ridiculous story about us.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That we’re a couple of sakura or something.”“Well, aren’t you?”“Officially, a sakura is a shill, a sidewalk vendor’s assistant—somebody who makes a purchase or lays down a bet to encourage onlookers to do the same.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Only nobody calls us that anymore.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The job’s no different, but we have a respectable-sounding title: sales promoters, we’re called.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The department stores treat us like proper agents, with our own accounts and everything.” The girl grasped the man’s wrist to hold it still, as the excited swaying of his body interfered with her attempts to focus on the map on the back of the card.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Now was my chance.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I reached out for the ticket, my fingers moving to the precise spot, at the precise speed, that I had intended.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In fat people, the bottom half of the body may be weighted down, but from the waist up, heaviness is no bar to agility.Yet I failed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The ticket was gone from between his fingers.Sleight of hand.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He waved his other arm with a flourish, and the ticket reappeared, ensconced between two fingers; he blew on it, and it spun like a windmill.“I give up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Please let me have it back,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Then we’ll talk.”“Say, this must be pretty valuable, from the way you’re carrying on about it.”“Didn’t use the right psychology.” The girl laughed, glancing from the card to me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You’re just encouraging him.”“It is valuable,” I said, in a voice so feeble that I made myself sick.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It’s worth more than anybody here could begin to afford.”“Don’t underestimate me.”“That’s not what I mean.” That crazy insect dealer, I thought—how long could he go on peeing?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If you don’t know how to use it, it won’t do you any good.” Nothing to do but relax and wait to be rescued.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It would be a total waste.” Still, no telling how effective his reinforcement would prove until the time came.“It’s not like ordinary merchandise, where you pay the money and it’s yours.” In terms of sheer physical strength, the insect dealer might have an edge, but in actual combat the shill would probably prove the more adept.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was a good match.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If the shill had the sharpness of wire, the insect dealer had the toughness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And I myself counted for something.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Weight can be a valuable weapon, provided you use it correctly.The girl spoke up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“A boat ticket can only mean some kind of boat.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What kind, is the question.”“The real question is the key,” said the man.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“What does it unlock?”“Finding the answer to that may be easier than you think.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"..“ Her voice was brightly animated, as if she were leafing through a travel brochure.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then she dangled the key roguishly near the tip of her nose.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The ticket might be gone, but I at least wanted the key back.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Capturing sitting flies in my bare hands is one of my hobbies.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I fixed my eyes on her hand.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The man had put one over on me, but with the girl I had more confidence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Still, something made me hesitate.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Perhaps it was self-reproach, a warning that I was getting too emotional.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer had been utterly uninterested, yet I had gone out of my way to press a ticket on him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Now, when the shills grabbed eagerly at the bait, I found myself trying desperately to retrieve it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Mustn’t be prey to impulse.The thing to do was play for time, and wait till I could join forces with the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Above all, I had to see that tickets to survival did not start getting scattered around out of all control.A furious rain came lashing down, bombarding us with great pellets of water.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Spray obscured visibility.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The concrete floor hummed in resonance.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Shoppers ran en masse for the exits, while stallkeepers raced to take in their wares.In the confusion, the pair ran off and disappeared.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was no time even to call to them to stop.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I started to chase after them, squeezing out through the side opening of the stall, when the weight of accumulated rainwater on the canvas roof caused the supports to lean.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My foot got caught in the crosspiece, and I fell forward, flat on my face.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A sharp pain flashed though my knee like incandescent light.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Weak knees are the bane of the very fat.Someone helped me up from behind, so near I could smell the sweat in his armpits.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was the insect dealer.“Where in hell have you been?”“Sorry.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I didn’t think it would take so long, but it turned out I had to take a crap too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ve had loose bowels off and on for a while.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Maybe it’s the weather; who knows?”“Go after them.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Hurry!”“After who?”“The shills, of course.” I stood and started to run off ahead of him, but my left leg was rubbery and lacking totally in sensation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I clung to his shoulder, barely managing to keep upright.“That woman is a looker, isn’t she?” he enthused.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“That face makes me want to take her in my arms.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That ass makes me want—”“Never mind that.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They ran off with my stuff.”“What stuff ?”“The tickets.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They swiped them and ran off.”“Now why would they want to do a thing like that?” He pulled me back under the canvas, out of the rain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I would have resisted, but my leg wasn’t obeying orders.“You wouldn’t take it so lightly if you knew how much those tickets are worth.”“How should I know?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m sure they don’t, either.”“Their instincts were better than yours, though.” The scanty hair on his big round head looked as if someone had scribbled it on with a ballpoint pen.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Water dripped from his earlobes and the point of his chin, as if someone had left the faucet running.“Relax,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I think I know where they went.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you can walk, I’ll let you lean on my shoulder.” There was pain like a scattering of broken needles, but normal sensation was beginning to return.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I gripped the shoulder of the insect dealer, who carried the suitcase, and we headed toward the exit, getting wet to the skin.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The store loudspeakers were announcing closing time to the accompaniment of “Auld Lang Syne.” The man evidently in charge of dismantling stalls came dashing up the emergency stairway, pulled out a crowbar from the toolbag slung around his hips, and set to work, starting in a corner.In front of the elevators there was a roofed area some fifteen feet square, filled with a jostling crowd seeking escape from the rain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The overload bell was ringing, and the elevator doors were wide open.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No one moved to get out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No one could have—the elevator was packed too tight.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Angry shouts .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

crying children .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.. women’s screams .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"and the bell, ringing and ringing .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.“Hopeless.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Damn!”“We’ve got to hurry and find them!,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The man had a crew cut, and the woman had curly hair.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She was wearing a T-shirt printed with some kind of scenery on the front—”“Forget it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Take a look at that.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No way.”“Why not take the stairs?”“We’re on the ninth floor, you know.”“So?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I don’t care.”We circled around in back of the elevators till we came to a white steel door.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
On it was a wooden sign marked EMERGENCYEXIT.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.4MY BIOLOGICAL FATHERIS CALLED INOTOTSUThe door swung open to a noise like the buzzing of ten thousand horseflies—the hum of motors reverberating down the pit of the stairwell.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was a steep, strictly-business stairway, a world away from the gaudy bustle of the store interior.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The walls were of plain concrete, adorned only with large numbers on each landing to mark off the successive floors.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The air smelled of raw pelts hanging up to dry.The railing was on the left, which made it easier for me to favor my injured left knee.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On the sixth-floor landing we stopped for breath; I tried straightening my leg and putting weight on it.There was a watery sensation, but the pain remained local.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The insect dealer’s glasses were starting to steam over.“Are you sure you know where they went?” I asked.“They have an office.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A rented one, with just a phone, but an office.”“ ‘Shills for hire,’ is that it?”“It’s a referral agency for sidewalk vendors.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They keep a percentage of the space rental fee.”“Then they are racketeers.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I knew it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He tried to gloss it over—called himself a ‘sales promoter’ or some damn thing.”“They don’t seem to have any direct connections to organized crime, though.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If they did, they could never deal with the department store here so openly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Who knows, maybe they pay their dues on the sly.”“It wouldn’t surprise me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was something slimy about them.”“Her too?”The question was impossible for me to answer in an offhand way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I stopped, pretending my knee hurt.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer shifted the suitcase to his other hand and looked back at me, a faint smile on his face.“Doesn’t she get to you?” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“She does to me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She’s too good for him.”“He called her his fishing lure.”“Did he, now.” He licked his upper lip, then his lower.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The suitcase bumped down the stairs in time to his footsteps.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“The man’s no fool.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You have to give him credit for that.”“Do you really think they headed straight for the office at this hour?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Maybe we should phone first, to make sure.” We passed the fifth floor, then the fourth-floor landing, brushing past a pair of uniformed security guards in an evident hurry—probably on their way up to straighten out the crowd and get the elevators going again.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Rain washed against the skylight.“If I were you, I wouldn’t even bother doing that,” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I’d make straight for the harbor.”“Harbor?”“Sure.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That ticket gets you on board a ship, right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A ship means a harbor.”“But my ship isn’t in the water.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s sort of .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.” I groped for a way to express it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It’s in dry dock, you could say.”“Well, it’s only a question of time till they find it and get on board.”“What makes you say that?”“There’s a map on the back of that ticket, isn’t there?”“You mean you’ve already looked at it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That was quick.”“It’s a habit of mine,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“While I’m in the john, I have to have something to read.”“Do you think they could find it with just that map to go on?”“A fisherman could.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I like deep-sea fishing myself, so I knew where it was the minute I saw it.”“Oh .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What about him?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Does he fish?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He did make that crack about fishing by lure.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“That area is full of great fishing spots,” said the insect dealer, giving his hip pocket a slap where the ticket apparently was.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I know my way around there pretty well.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Wasn’t there an old fishermen’s inn somewhere near there?”I felt a sick embarrassment, as if he’d told me my fly was open.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I didn’t want to hear any more.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
To have the past dragged aboard my ship was the last thing I wanted.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When we set sail, I wanted my slate as clean as a newborn baby’s.“Oh, sorry, I forgot to give you back your watch.” On the second-floor landing, we took a final rest.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My knee was almost entirely free of pain now and felt merely a bit stiff—though to keep my companion off his guard it seemed wiser to pretend otherwise.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer strapped his watch on his wrist, sat down on the eupcaccia suitcase, and stuck a cigarette in his mouth.“No smoking.”“I’m not going to light it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I only smoke five a day.”“See there?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You do want to survive.”“No, just to enjoy my last moments.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Lung cancer isn’t my idea of fun.”We looked at each other, and shared a laugh for no reason.“Maybe you’re right,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I guess it would be smarter to go straight to the ship than to waste time stopping by their office on a hunch.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Are you coming with me?”“Sure—as far as the first-aid room.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s right on this floor, somewhere in back.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’ve got to attend to a sprain or it’ll get worse.”“Hold on just a minute.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s not what you said before.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You promised you’d help me find them.”“I did?”“Besides, first aid isn’t going to help me drive my jeep.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s parked down in the underground parking lot.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The clutch weighs a ton.”“You want me to drive it?”“What’s the matter, can’t you drive?”“Are you kidding?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’re looking at a former truckdriver.I’m just wondering why I should go that far out of my way for you.”“Well, I gave you back your watch, but I notice you haven’t given me back my ticket.”“If you want it back, just say so.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I thought you’d traded me this for the rest of the eupcaccias.” He started to get up, fumbling in his hip pocket.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Alarm took possession of me, as if I were watching an egg roll toward a table edge.“Nobody’s asking for it back!”“Lower your voice, will you?” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I can’t stand loud voices.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Dogs barking, hogs squealing, people yelling—it all drives me nuts.”Hogs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Did someone say hogs?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My ears buzzed as if filled with crawling insects.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I wasn’t always a porker.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When I was a boy, I was as skinny as a shish kebab skewer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not all hogs are fat, either, as far as that goes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Hog” became synonymous with “Fatso” back when ninety percent of all hogs raised were Yorkshires.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The Yorkshire is a lard breed, and before synthetic oils and fats came into wide use, it was an important source of fat.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not just cooking fat: lard from Yorkshire hogs was used for a variety of things, from all-purpose salve and tallow to ointment for rectal suppositories—even a mustache pomade said to have been popular with the French aristocracy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then, as demand for pork grew, the Yorkshire breed gave way increasingly to the bacon-type Landrace breed and the loin-and-ham-type Berkshire breed, both of which have a thin fat layer and a high proportion of excellent lean meat.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With four extra ribs, the newer breeds were considerably longer and sturdier than their ancestors.My biological father (a pariah in his own hometown) goes by the nickname Inototsu—literally “charging boar,” which is certainly an accurate description of his personality.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not only is he as reckless and dangerous as a wild boar, but he used to run a fishermen’s inn out on a rocky cove called Inokuchi, or Boar’s Mouth (who would have thought the insect dealer would know anything about it!).",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The cove, where Mount Boar trails into the sea, is so called because it looks like the snout of a boar.That there should be some physical resemblance between my biological father and myself probably couldn’t be helped.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Both of us weigh nearly two hundred twenty pounds, but Inototsu is well over six feet tall and has a neck so short that he can’t wear ready-made shirts.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He really seems less a hog than a giant boar, with all the domineering brute force of one.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As a matter of fact, he is clumsy and timorous, but people always defer to him and are awed by his appearance.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To hide a peculiarly wavy hairline, he used to wear a loud green hunting cap, which only increased people’s apprehension.He always liked to stand out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He used to hang around the city hall when he had nothing better to do, and even had namecards printed up with some official-sounding bureaucratic title or other.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Eventually he got more ambitious, and started hankering after a real councilman’s badge.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His wife (my stepmother) was a practical woman; instead of protesting, she had him turn the deed to the fishing inn over to her for safekeeping.The inn was large, with a great many rooms, each provided with its own kitchen; it had a sizable clientele, including a number of cooks who liked to catch their own fish.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Inototsu’s only other assets consisted of two twenty-five-ton fishing vessels.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As his wife had feared, when he ran for office he sold these off to raise funds.But not even changing his hunting cap for a felt hat did any good; he always lost miserably.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When his money was gone, he became a terrible alcoholic and never bathed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Eventually he smelled so bad that dogs would run away from him.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
In the end they even threw him out of the city hall.One day he tripped over his wife and fell on her as she lay sleeping.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He escaped with a nose out of joint, but she died from internal rupture.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The rumor was that he had deliberately trampled her to death, but they let him go, for lack of evidence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even so, his entire staff quit in fear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was after that that Inototsu took in me and my mother.My mother had run a little cigarette stand on Mount Boar, just across the town road.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She had me after Inototsu raped her.Then the year after we went to the inn to live, the summer I was twelve, it was my turn to be accused of rape.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The victim was a waitress thirty years older than me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The one who raped her wasn’t me—I just happened to be spying on the scene of the crime.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But with Inototsu’s blood in my veins, I found it impossible to clear myself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Inototsu suddenly became a self-appointed emissary of justice; he caught me and shut me up in an abandoned underground quarry in the mountain (the present ship), where he kept me chained for an entire week, until Mother finally sneaked in and set me free.It was then that I started putting on weight.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I wish to make it absolutely clear that I was not born this way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My excess weight is compensation for this unreasonable violence inflicted on me in childhood.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My left ankle still bears scars from the chain.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At fourteen, I ran away from home, but I continued to gain weight, my hatred of Inototsu proliferating along with the scar tissue on my leg.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Rumor has it that he still hasn’t abandoned his old dream of becoming a councilman.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But who can take seriously a thug with a record of four (possibly seven) convictions, who is also an alcoholic and gives off a foul odor for thirty feet in all directions?Even I, his biological son, while living in the same city, have seen him face to face only once in the last few years.So please, please don’t talk to me about pigs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Just the sound of that word makes me feel as if my entire personality had been stuffed in a meat grinder.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Local people look on me as an overgrown hog, so I eliminated them from consideration as crew members from the start.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I eliminated almost everyone I ever knew, however casually.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Each person who seemed likely to call me a pig I changed mentally into a louse.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And then crushed between my nails.“Don’t hit the ceiling.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No harm intended.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As long as they don’t howl and make a lot of noise, I’ve got nothing against dogs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I have one myself—a mutt, nothing fancy.”“So do I.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What does that prove?”“A spitz, I bet.”“Flake off.”“Well, if you don’t want to go have your knee looked at, I can’t make you.” He shifted the unlit cigarette in his mouth, and looked up at a nonexistent window.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What did he see through it?“At this time of day, the first-aid room will be jammed anyway, with victims of department store fever.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They say it’s endemic among housewives who go home to an empty house.”“Then you’ll come with me to the ship?”“I didn’t say that.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll hang on to the ticket, though.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There’s always next time.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When the sun starts to go down, I have to have a drink.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s mainly what keeps me going, day in and day out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll carry the eupcaccias out to your jeep for you.”“You underestimate the gravity of the situation.”“You overestimate it.” Briskly he clapped his hands—fleshy hands that made me think of heavy-duty gloves—and sprang to his feet.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I don’t brood over things the way you do.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s not my style.”“Oh, crap—say you’ll come with me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve got booze on the ship, if that’s what you want.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If we take the bypass, we can get there in less than an hour, and I know a shortcut that only a jeep can manage.”“I can’t figure it out—why you’re counting so much on me.”“Blame it on the eupcaccia.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s what brought us together.”“Look, as far as I’m concerned, the eupcaccia was a dud.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I only sold one, so that proves it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I misread the people’s mind.What’s-his-name, the German psychologist, has a theory that this is the age of simulation games.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Eventually reality gets confused with symbol.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There’s a desire for enclosed spaces, like pillboxes—or with a little more aggression thrown in, tanks.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you can’t follow it, don’t worry.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was all in the paper.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Anyway, the end result is a boom in electronic monsters, model guns, and computer war games.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He could be on to something, don’t you think?”“The shill said the reason the eupcaccias don’t sell is because they don’t have horns.”“That could very well be.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You sure you wouldn’t be better off teaming up with him instead of me?”“Personally, I don’t give a shit about horns.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"One of these days I’m going to design a ship’s flag, and I have in mind a logo based on the eupcaccia.”“In the end, what do you think you’ll do with your ship—subdivide or lease?”“How could I put a price tag on life?”The stairs came to an end in front of the basement door.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer put his hand on the knob and paused.“They station a guard here to keep employees from carrying off merchandise,” he explained.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“We don’t have anything to hide, but still you don’t want to undergo a body search, do you?” He opened the door.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Out poured that uniform concentration of noise that characterizes basement grocery sections of a large department store.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A standing screen was placed before the door, but there was no sign of anyone around.“Here we go.” Holding up the suitcase like the figurehead on a ship’s prow, he plunged into the crowd, shouting, “One side, please, sick man coming through, one side, please.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Everybody out of the way, there’s a sick man coming through.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.” I obliged by walking hunched over and breathing with exaggerated difficulty.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the parking lot, a line of cars had begun to form.“Hey, this jeep is huge,” exclaimed the insect dealer.“It’s 2600 cc; the torque is terrific.”But he apparently felt no temptation to drive.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He went around to the passenger’s side, pushed the seat forward, and heaved the contents of the suitcase on the floor in the back.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I’ll throw in the plastic containers for nothing.” He didn’t even ask how my knee was.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All right, the hell with him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’d had enough.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The knee was good enough to drive with now.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was his loss.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’d given him his chance, but I couldn’t look out for him forever.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If it came to that, I could drive off the shills single-handed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To prepare for such an eventuality, I had set up a number of traps behind staircases and at junctures in the tunnels.They were of all kinds: spring-powered mechanical ones, electronic ones, and devices using chemical sprays.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was confident they would stop any unwanted intruders.“Take care of yourself, all right?” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“When the bomb falls in Lebanon or wherever, I’ll drop by your shelter.”“It’s not a shelter; it’s a ship.” I turned the key and started the engine, taking a deep breath to relax.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“A shelter is only temporary, but on a ship, life goes on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s a place to live, day after day.”“But when you put into port, everyone goes ashore, right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A ship is like any other vehicle—a means of going from point A to point B.”“There are people who live entirely on the water.”“So who wants to live like a goddamn turtle?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I couldn’t stand being stuck in some hole in the ground nose to nose with you every day.”“It’s hardly a hole in the ground,” I protested.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It’s a disused underground quarry—a small mountain of rock has been dug out of it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you felt like it, you could easily go three or four days without seeing any signs of me, never mind my nose.” The insect dealer spat out his cigarette, which had broken in two from the moisture of his saliva.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“A small mountain, eh?Sounds pretty impressive.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How many people do you figure it can hold?”“You could visit every underground station and shopping center across Japan and not find anything to compare with it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The entire population of a small town would fit in comfortably.”“How is it administered?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Is there any residents’organization?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Are you in charge of promotion?”“As of now, I’m the sole resident.”“That couldn’t be.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There must be other people with tickets, anyway, even if they’re not living there yet.”“Nobody but you—not counting the shills.”“I can’t believe it.”“Then don’t.”I stepped on the clutch and put the engine in gear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A faint spasm, weaker than pain, ran through my knee.“Wait—it’s not that easy to believe.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Why should you be the only one there?” His fingers tightened their grip on the hood.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The tables had turned.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I disengaged the gears and gave an exaggerated sigh.“The former owners want to forget all about it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Four different enterprises got together, swarmed over the mountain, and dug it all out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then there was a series of cave-ins, and in the end—just eight years ago—they relinquished their mining rights.The tunnel entrances are all sealed, and housing developers are selling off plots of residential land on the surface.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m certain nobody wants to be reminded of what’s belowground.”“Even if operations have been shut down, the place must still be registered in somebody’s name.”“Officially, it doesn’t even exist.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I checked it out at the city hall.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There’s no street number, no address of any kind.”“But it is Japanese territory, isn’t it?”In place of an answer, I put my foot back on the clutch.“Sorry.” He stuck his big head in the window and grabbed my arm, which was holding the wheel.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Wait, let me do the driving,” he said, adding sheepishly, “I suppose you knew all along I’d wind up coming in the end.”“Then you admit the disaster is at hand?”“Sure.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The world is lousy with disasters, everybody knows that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But this is really amazing.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can’t get over it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’re like—what should I say?—an emperor, or a dictator, or something.”“Yes, of a ghost country.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But I don’t like dictators.” He swung into the driver’s seat, shaking his top-heavy head.“Funniest darned feeling.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I am grateful for one thing, though.When I was a kid at school, no one ever picked me for anything.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I guess I do owe this to the eupcaccia, when you think about it.” 5TRAVELS WHILE SQUATTINGON THE TOILETHis experience as a truckdriver had apparently stood him in good stead; soon after we left the parking lot, he was handling the jeep with assurance.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was rush hour, and near the expressway entrance ramp we got caught in a traffic jam.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As long as we stayed moving, wind entering through the numerous crevices in the canvas top kept the interior of the jeep tolerably cool, but as we crawled though the rain it became unbearably steamy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not only was there no air-conditioning, but the ventilation was poor, and we alternated between mopping our perspiration and clearing fog off the windows.“Is there gas in the tank?”“Yes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That gauge is off.”“If they took the same route as us, we’ll never make it in time, anyway; what say we stop somewhere for a plate of curried rice?”“It hasn’t even been half an hour,” I protested.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Besides, I know a shortcut that’s made for a jeep.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s too soon to call it quits.”“Aye, aye, sir.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s too soon to give up.” Either he was trying too hard to fake it, or else a genuine show of submission came off clumsily from lack of experience.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In any case, something in his voice did not ring true.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Then how about if I go out afterwards and pick up something for dinner?” he said.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“There must be a grocery store in the neighborhood.”“I’ve got all kinds of provisions laid in.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s an oceangoing cruise vessel, you’ve got to realize.”“Right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And I suppose you’re a hearty eater.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All right, I’ll wait.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just in case we get there first,” he went on, “have you got some sort of plan?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Those two are stubborn.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, they’ve got a key.”“I’ll bolt the door from the inside.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Steel door, steel bolt.”“They might decide to lay siege.”“I said I was well stocked up, didn’t I?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
If they want a war of endurance they’ll get one.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I can outlast anyone.” The insect dealer chuckled, apparently satisfied; his voice and eyes alike conveyed genuine mirth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I did not join in.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What if the shill—the man—thought of using the girl as bait?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Would I be able to stay inside even then?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The bolt might be steel, but not my heart.“And what if they get there first?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then what?” asked the insect dealer.“Then we’re in trouble.”“When he talks he sprays saliva, did you notice?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve heard people with overactive salivary glands tend to have a violent streak.”At the tollbooth, they were apparently limiting highway access; we progressed barely three or four car lengths at a time, in spurts.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The underside of my chin felt prickly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My skin was so moist with sweat that it seemed in danger of peeling off.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Put a penguin in hot water and they say it goes bananas.“You suppose they went by car too?” I asked.“Probably, but what make?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That I can’t tell you.” Knowing wouldn’t have done much good, for the windshield wipers were having little effect.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All I could make out was the hazy outline of the car ahead.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I wanted to take off my shirt and wring it out.“Oh, for a breeze,” I sighed.“Why the jeep?” he asked.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Do you get around much?”“Did once.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I used to be a photographer’s assistant.”“Used to be?”“Yup.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sometimes I think I’ll take a shot of something, and I get my camera all set up, and then before I know it I lose interest in the whole idea.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I guess I’m just lazy.”“So am I.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The human being is basically a very lazy animal, you know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s how we evolved from monkeys: by using our brains to get out of doing things.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But photography’s a good line of work, it seems to me.”“Not as good as it seems.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, I was only an assistant.”“Still, it’s nothing to be ashamed of.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You wouldn’t have to worry if a policeman stopped you on the street and started asking questions.”We passed the tollbooth.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Suddenly the scenery took on a transparent clarity.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Traffic still wasn’t moving much, but since we were on an elevation, at least there was a breeze.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I thought with renewed gratitude of my life in the quarry, where the air was naturally cool and there was no need to worry about asthma or allergies, as with artificial air-cooling systems.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I couldn’t wait to get back to my ship.Just to set the record straight, I’m not a stay-at-home by nature.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As a matter of fact, I’m very fond of travel—but not in a jeep: I roam all over Japan while squatting on the toilet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The eupcaccia dines as he evacuates, the insect dealer does a little light reading or looking around, I travel.My favorites are the color aerial photographs from the National Land Board: detailed photographs taken with a special Swiss camera, each one ten inches square.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Depending on the area covered, they range in scale from 8000:1 to 15,000:1.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Yet each has unbelievable resolving power, so great that with a magnifying glass you can make out not only individual houses but cars and people as well.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Fields are distinguishable from rice paddies.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You can even tell more or less how the streets are paved.It’s still more interesting when you look at such photos through a special device called a stereoscope.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Since aerial photographs are taken at fixed intervals—one every ten seconds from a survey plane—approximately three-fourths of the geographical features in successive photographs are redundant.By aligning two photographs in sequence, therefore, and taking advantage of the resulting parallax, you can make the scene stand out in three dimensions.The stereoscope consists of a rectangular metal plate fitted with two adjacent convex lenses, and a hollow for the nose like that on a fancy-dress mask; it has a six-inch support at either end.First you locate the same point on both photographs, then you arrange them side by side so that the two points are directly across from each other.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The photos should be slightly closer together than the width of the lenses.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The important thing is to maintain a fixed bearing.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then place the stereoscope directly over the photos and peer through the lenses from a slight distance.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Concentrate your gaze in the center, ignoring the periphery.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There is no correction for visual problems, so if you’re shortsighted, keep your glasses on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Continue to focus intently, making fine adjustments in the distance between the photos as needed, and at some point you will hit on just the right arrangement: then magically the low-elevation places will drop away, and the high-elevation ones come thrusting up at you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It goes beyond perspective; you would swear you were looking not at a photograph but at an exact replica of the scene.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The impression of depth is in fact intensified so that in an urban area, the high-rise buildings and TV towers seem to jump up and threaten to stab you; in a mountainous area it’s the crags and treetops on the peaks.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the beginning, I would always find myself ducking or closing my eyes.It gets to be an obsession.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
An addiction.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I spend about five hours a day roaming around the photo maps, stopping every half hour to cool my eyes with a damp towel and apply one or two kinds of eyedrops.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Since the only thing that keeps me home is a desire to spare my knees, it is ideal for me to move about freely this way, using my eyeballs as wheels.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Traveling with three-dimensional maps is like learning to walk on air.You can cross the ocean in a flash, if you’ve a mind to, island-hopping till you reach the mainland, then perhaps going on to still other islands beyond.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I prefer not to get greedy, but to stick patiently to one area, looking at everything until I have familiarized myself with it completely: old mazelike neighborhoods in hilly areas without a single straight road or right-angled intersection; hopeless tangles of winding streets through which not even the local shopkeepers can direct you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The reason residents themselves cannot draw an accurate map is that they see their surroundings from eye level only.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I, however, am privileged to have the entire scene spread out before me at once.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If there is a branch road that joins the main road ahead, I can divide myself in two and enjoy both at the same time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If I come to a dead end—say, a road blocked off by a cliff wall—I need only pull away from the stereoscope and view the photo as a flat surface again.With no fear of what others may think, I can walk anywhere I want and peer freely into any building.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As long as you plan out an escape route beforehand, even fairly bold actions are safe, like cutting across lawns or marching straight through rooms.And so I explore it all: sluices running the length of a stone staircase; a two-story building whose upper story is a lighter color, obviously a recent addition; a garden with pond, surrounded by tiled rooftops; a cottage buried in a thicket; a house with a vast flat roof, no garden; a farmhouse, under its eaves a glimpse of the hood of a fire engine, converted from a small pickup truck; a Shinto shrine with twenty-four storage drums lined up in the back; the storehouse of an agricultural cooperative, with a hole in the roof; a lumber mill jutting out into the river; a lone dwelling buried deep in the mountains, where it seems no sunlight could possibly penetrate at any hour of the day.And connecting them all, roads that are not roads.Information accumulating in direct proportion to the passing of time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When I grow tired, it is pleasant to sit on a bench in the park overlooking the harbor, and drink in great drafts of sunshine.Strolling along a riverbank, taking in the view, is also enjoyable.Wheat fields are deep, lush, and even in hue; fields of vegetables, rough-looking and rather mottled.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Along the river, it’s even possible to distinguish pampas grass from hogweed (disgusting name).",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I also enjoy flying over mountain paths hidden beneath rows of flowering cherries, finding my way by trial and error.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I can lurk in a clump of tall grass and see how it feels to be a peeping Tom, or make believe I’m a detective on a stakeout.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If anyone gives me a funny look, I can simply leap over to the radio relay station atop a distant mountain.It has long been a source of dissatisfaction to me that the real world doesn’t operate the same way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Come to think of it, the world of my aerial relief photographs bears a great similarity to eupcaccia droppings.“Are you sure this clutch doesn’t need tuning?” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“There’s not enough give.”“That makes it safer shifting gears on uphill curves,” I said.“Damn, I hate getting stuck behind a truck in the rain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The spray hits you straight on.”We turned off the interchange at the prefectural border and entered the oceanside bypass.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Partly because there were no more houses along the way, the wind blew more fiercely, and the rain snapped with a thousand fingers against flapping sails.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We had to yell to hear each other, so we said very little.After a while we came to a long, straight descent, not far from our destination.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The line of hills between us and the sea dropped away, and far ahead we saw water.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The foam on the boiling waves looked like dirty soap bubbles.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A green sign announced: EXIT FOR KABUTO, 1 MILE.“Take the next exit.”“How do you read that place name?” he asked.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was written in an unusual combination of Chinese characters.“Ka-bu-to, like the helmet worn with an old suit of armor.Peach-colored (ham-colored?)",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"rifts appeared in the scudding clouds, and the night scene took on the brightness of late afternoon.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A bolt of lightning flashed horizontally across the sky.We pulled up at the service area past the tollbooth and unzipped the windows.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then, raising my shirt to my chin to let in the air, I mopped up my perspiration.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Suddenly my eyes took in a familiar sight: fukujin-zuke, the red condiment served with curried rice.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The picture on the restaurant billboard made me realize I was starving.“Riding in a jeep gives you an appetite, doesn’t it?” The insect dealer seemed to share my reflexes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“That place over there looks empty.”“Forget it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There isn’t time.” It wouldn’t do to betray weakness.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A ship’s captain has to maintain the proper dignity.Rather than announce myself to him as captain, I resolved to carry on resolutely until he addressed me as “Captain” of his own accord.“We don’t have to go inside and sit down—let’s just get a takeout dinner.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We can eat in the car on the way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"How about some charcoal-grilled eels and a couple of cans of coffee?”“If you intend to eat and drive at the same time, it had better be kamaboko,”* I said firmly, determined to let him know who was in charge.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"* Boiled fish paste.“Okay, kamaboko it is.” He ran off through the rain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Having expected more of an argument, I felt somewhat deflated.Soon he came dashing back, a handkerchief over his head, his face all smiles.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Between the thumb and middle finger of his left hand he was carrying something on skewers, and with his little finger he gripped a paper bag.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
In his right hand he held two paper cups.“Jumbo franks and coffee.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Also, I got four packages of kamaboko, five to a package.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We can have them now in the car, or save them for later over a beer.”“Jumbo what?”“Frankfurters.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They’re loaded with mustard, so be sure you don’t get any on your pants.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With that color, it could be embarrassing.”I took a bite—and wondered how I had endured the hunger for so long.“What’s your name again?” I asked.“Son of a gun.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I guess we never did introduce ourselves.Komono here.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Manta Komono.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sorry, I’m all out of name-cards.”“Unusual name.”“It comes from a word for a kind of reed, the kind used to make mats.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My ancestors were probably roadside beggars who sat on reed mats all day.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What’s your name?”“Never mind.”He tossed the empty frankfurter stick out the window, licked the mustard and ketchup off his fingers, and put the jeep back in gear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Got something to hide?”“No, it’s not that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s just that for the last few years, about the only time I’ve used my name is when I renewed my driver’s license.”“That’s a good one.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But we’re going to be buddies now; I’ve got to call you something.”Now that he brought it to my attention, I realized it was true: unconsciously I had been avoiding having people call me by my name.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There were times when the sound of my name called out unexpectedly had gone through me like an electric shock.Even when I was an assistant in the photography studio, it hadn’t been long before everybody was calling me Mole.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That was so vastly preferable to Pig that I would deliberately introduce myself to people that way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And now I’d become a mole in reality.“.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Actually, if I’ve got to call you something, it might as well be ‘Captain.’ ”His laughter was like the sound of paper being crumpled deep in my ears.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I felt the sharp whiff of loneliness.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A chance stranger had just volunteered to call me Captain.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perhaps this was all for the best.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Brothers end up mutual strangers, they say, and even in marriage, the more distant the relationship the better.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As a principle for choosing my crew, the system of random selection fell right in line with the laws of heredity.“That shortcut you were talking about .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
you mean crossing the river and then going over the mountain?”“How did you know?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You shouldn’t be able to figure that much out from a map like that.”“A deliveryman develops a sixth sense.” He wiped the top of his head with the handkerchief, then blew his nose into it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Look at those diesel exhaust fumes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s what I hate most about expressways.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Somebody really ought to get figures on the incidence of lung cancer among truckdrivers.” Seen from Kabuto City across the river, Mount Boar was a steep cliff with vertical pleats, somewhat like the kabuto of a medieval samurai.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In fact, people in the city have always called it Mount Kabuto, using the character for “helmet” to write the mountain’s name.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On the other side, it’s known as Mount Boar.Neither name is on the maps, though; nowadays the area is known officially as Skylark Heights.Heading north, we crossed Kabuto Bridge and came out on Mount Boar.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Tangerine orchards stretched along the skirt of the mountain, to our left.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At the first bus stop, we turned off the national highway, took a narrow road that cut through an orchard (it looks at first glance like a private road), and headed straight for the top.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This was the shortcut.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you don’t know about it, you lose ten or fifteen minutes going out to the railway station and through the underpass, and then skirting back around the foot of the mountain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’d been counting on this advantage when I’d assured the insect dealer that we could still beat our quarry to the ship.The road quickly changed to a steep and winding dirt path.Roadside grasses were heavy with rainwater, and the going was slippery.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He locked the hubs and went into four-wheel drive.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The road finally leveled out near the summit.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Here it was less a road than a clearing in a dense woods.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The rain had completely stopped, and overhead, ragged clouds flew by like torn shreds of threadbare cloth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Their silhouettes were highlighted by the light of the early moon, or perhaps by lingering rays of the just-set sun.“What’s that over there?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Looks like some sort of monument.”Now that he said so, it did in a way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On the left of the woods, the crouching black shadow of a rock suggested some structure of no practical use.“An outcropping of the rock base,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Apparently a shaft into the original quarry.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The land here belongs to whoever owns these orchards, and they must have left it as it was.Everywhere else the land was leveled off.”“That wouldn’t be the gangway to your ship, would it?”“You’re way off.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You saw the map; it’s farther down the mountain, on the coastal side.”“I thought it was strange.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But the tunnels interconnect underground, don’t they?”“I’ve done some exploring, but this is much farther than I’ve been able to go.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As the crow flies, it must be a good three-quarters of a mile or more.”At the end of the woods was a fence topped with barbed wire.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Along the fence was a light steel-frame building that appeared to be some sort of communal facility (actually it was the office of the Broom Brigade, but at this hour no one would be in yet).",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In front of it, the barbed wire had been cut, and tire marks were visible on the ground.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then we entered an asphalt road, and the scenery underwent an abrupt change.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This was Skylark Heights.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The slope, curving gently down to the ocean, was covered with roofs of house after house, all shining in the pale coppery light that leaked from between the clouds until the scene seemed more suggestive of an armadillo than a wild boar.“We’re almost there.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Put it back into two-wheel drive and pick up a little speed.”Until eight years before, Mount Boar had been densely wooded, in better keeping with its name.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Quarry motors vied in emitting murderous screeches, while big dump trucks fought for space on the narrow roads, flinging gravel and spraying muddy water as they went.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Indeed, there had been an atmosphere of sufficient danger to frighten children away without any need for“Keep Out” signs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Now there were orange-colored streetlights at regular intervals, curbs painted in yellow wavy lines, glass-walled telephone booths, quiet cherry-tree-lined streets used solely by local residents, and row upon row of houses, each with its own modest, fenced-in garden, each running its own air conditioner.Suddenly the insect dealer broke into a nasal falsetto, singing a children’s tune: “ ‘The gold bug is a rich old bug—’ ” Equally suddenly he broke off into an embarrassed cough.“Sorry—I can’t help it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Before the eupcaccia, I used to sell stag beetles.”“I heard about it from the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They have horns, don’t they?”“Here’s my old pitch.” He held up his left index finger in the air, and said in a loud voice, full throttle: “Can you see it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Look, right there, the tiny insect on the end of my finger.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Stag beetles bring luck, ladies and gentlemen, just as we Japanese have been singing for centuries in that old song.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But did you know that ours is not the only country in the world to value the stag beetle so highly?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The ancient Egyptians called it the scarab beetle, and worshipped it as a manifestation of the sun god.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And as any encyclopedia will tell you, the famous French entomologist Doctor Fabre devoted his life to its study.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Buy one today and let it bring you luck.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The one I have here is especially rare.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This, ladies and gentlemen, is the world’s smallest beetle, found only in tropical jungles.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Can you make it out?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It may be too small to see with the naked eye.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They say the magnifying glass was invented just to aid in observing stag beetles.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That led in turn to developments in astronomy, so you see you can hardly underestimate their importance.”“Did they sell?”“You bet they did—more than the eupcaccias, anyway.” The best customers are mothers with their children in tow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All the kids have to do is give me a sidelong glance, with just a hint of a smile, and the mothers are caught off balance.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They always end up loosening their purse strings.”“You have a smooth delivery.”“That’s right, smooth as butter.” He stuck out his tongue, wiggled the tip, and said, “Well, that’s a mother for you, isn’t it.” The downhill road ends by the city hall complex, with its covering of black glass and black imitation marble; from there a four-lane prefectural road carries you due south to the harbor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The area went into a decline after stone hauling came to an end and the bypass opened up, but even so, we encountered a fair amount of traffic as we proceeded—mostly pickup trucks, two or three lined up at every red light.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This harbor still has the largest freezing facilities of any fishing harbor in the prefecture.“The race is as good as over.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Whichever way you come, you end up here.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I hope we get there before they do.”“I don’t know.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That wasn’t much of a shortcut.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All we did was cross one little hill.”I knew that without being told.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Did he have to squash my last fragile hope?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He was the one who made us lose time at the start.“The national road swings way around, north of the tracks.If we left at the same time they did, we should have picked up a good fifteen minutes on them.”“Aye, aye, Captain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Straight on to the sea it is.” The sensation of being called Captain, now that I could finally taste it, brought nothing like the satisfaction I had so long anticipated.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On the contrary, I rather felt he was laughing at me.“See that row of orange streetlights up ahead?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s the bypass.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Take a left just before you reach there.” 6THE DOOR OF THEABANDONED CARWe crossed over a narrow stream, and the asphalt began to buckle and roll.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We were on a dilapidated town road whose surface was rough with gravel.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Soon the elevated bypass loomed overhead, supported by thick ferroconcrete piers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At first the town road runs parallel with the bypass, but at the second pier it pulls away, swinging around sharply until the two roads cross by the bay.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The crescent of land this formed is private property owned by Inototsu, my biological father, who let slide his chance to sell it to the highway department.The old fishermen’s inn was located on a rocky ledge directly under the present bypass.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No trace of it survives, neither grounds nor building nor wharf.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All that’s left to show for it is that steep crescent of land sandwiched between the bypass and the town road, hardly big enough for a doghouse.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s of so little value that not even Inototsu pays it any attention, so I had no difficulty in appropriating it for my own use.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At the center of the crescent is the entrance to the quarry—the place where I was taken in and chained twenty years ago, when I was accused of rape.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The vein had been exhausted and abandoned even then.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A number of artisans were using the site to make stone lanterns, as I recall; they used to sneak me tidbits from their lunches.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just what connection there was between the quarry and the grounds of the inn, I have never understood.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Inototsu probably could tell me, but rather than face him, I prefer to remain in the dark.The town road was made by open-cut excavation in that steep slope which falls away to the rocky shelf in the cove, like a hard-boiled egg sliced at an angle.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"From the highest point, the center of the curve, the drop is nearly twenty-five feet, and so rough and precipitous that descent is impossible without a rope.“Hang a right in front of the first concrete pier,” I directed him.“There’s no road.”“You’re forgetting this is a jeep.”Tall weeds covered what was once the entrance to the fishermen’s inn.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To get back to the rocky promontory, you have to go under the bypass and skirt the beach.“They’ll never figure this out,” said the insect dealer.“Now pull over and cut the engine.” I took a flashlight from the toolbox behind my seat, and stepped outside.“Your knee seems okay now, doesn’t it?”“Yes, now that you mention it.”I had too much on my mind to go on pretending otherwise.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I crouched down, peered around, and pricked up my ears.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If the shill and his companion had indeed read the map correctly and beaten us here, they would have had to abandon their car in this vicinity.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There were no fresh tire tracks.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The only sounds that I could make out were the vibrations from cars whizzing by overhead and the whistle of wind on the waves.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I detected no whir of an engine trying to pull out of the sand, nor any foreign object interrupting the horizon’s faint glow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We were in time.“Isn’t that a footprint over there?”The insect dealer, Komono (it will take me a while to start calling him by his name), leaned out from the driver’s seat and pointed to a section of sand near the pier.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I turned my flashlight on it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
In a mound of sand between the pier and the ledge were two small indentations that did bear a certain resemblance to footprints.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Absorbed in tracing the probable route of the other car, I had somehow overlooked them.“Probably a dog.”“Too distinct for that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Or are they?”“Let’s get a move on.” Motioning to him to slide over, I climbed into the driver’s seat, put the gears in four-wheel drive, and started up in second, heading for the sands, gradually picking up speed as we circled around and went up from the beach onto the ledge.“Easy!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Don’t push your luck.” Clutching the dashboard, he put a cautionary hand on the steering wheel.“Leggo—you’ll break a finger!” I yelled.Flying to the right, careening to the left, we dashed furiously along.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A shadow crossed the headlight beams.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I slammed on the brakes and broke into a sweat as a stray dog, one hind leg missing from the knee down, slunk off deliberately into the grass with its head down.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A white beard and a sagging back gave the animal a decrepit appearance, but he was a wily old rascal, boss of the seven or eight strays whose territory this was.“So it was a dog’s footprints.” The insect dealer stiffened, and added grimly, “Bloodthirsty-looking creature.” I turned off the engine.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Low growls crawled over the ground, and a panting sound like the chafing of pieces of wood.“Hear it?” I said.“Are there more of them?”“Seven or eight, as far as I can tell.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The one you just saw is their leader.”“Dogs seldom attack, I’ve heard,” he said hopefully.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“They say if they’re not expressly trained to kill, they won’t.”“These would.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They don’t trust people.”“They know you, though, don’t they, Captain?”“Well, yes .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”This time I caught a touch of sycophancy in his use of the word.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Still, it was better than being laughed at.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I switched the ignition back on, drove straight under the bypass, and pulled up as close as I could to the cliff ahead.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Insects attracted by the headlights crashed into the windshield.A mountain of garbage and trash reached nearly halfway up the cliff: besides the usual assortment of kitchen refuse, there were nylon stockings wound around a bicycle seat; homemade pickles, complete with pickling crock; a fish head, its mouth the socket for a broken light bulb; an old refrigerator, now a dog coffin; an empty Coke bottle crowned with an old shoe that had melted into gum; and a TV tube stuffed with an insect’s nest that looked exactly like cotton candy.“Great—a garbage dump.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just great.”“Camouflage,” I explained.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I’ll bet you can’t tell where the entrance is.”“I’ll bet I can.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Inside the body of that old junk heap on top of the pile.”His powers of observation were impressive.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had to admit that if you looked carefully you could see a rope hanging down inside the rusty, abandoned car.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But I had hardly expected my camouflage to be seen through so quickly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even inside the car, it would have taken someone of enormous experience and insight to find anything suspicious in the smell of fresh machine oil on the door handle and hinges.“You have good instincts.”“Not bad.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How the heck did you collect all this junk?”“Easy.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I just posted a sign on the road overhead reading‘Private Property, No Littering.’ ”“Ingenious.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But doesn’t it make a huge racket when you climb up to grab onto the rope?”“It’s all fastened down.”“Let’s go.” The insect dealer slapped his hands on his knees and bounded out of the jeep.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He spread his legs apart, placed his clasped hands behind his head, and began to do warming-up exercises, twisting right and left.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He was more agile than I’d expected, and his oversize head was not terribly conspicuous.There probably were athletes of his build, I thought.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I’m ready for an adventure,” he said.“Look in back under the canvas and you’ll find a box with rubber boots and cotton gloves inside.”“I can see where you’d need the boots.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just the thought of worms and centipedes crawling in my socks gives me the creeps.” As if they’d been waiting for him to go around in back of the jeep, several of the dogs began howling.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They were apparently roving around in the shadows.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Stray dogs are like volleyball players in the split-second timing with which they switch from defense to attack.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Forcing open the canvas top with his whole body, the insect dealer dived inside.“I told you once I don’t like barking dogs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And ones that bite are worse.”“Don’t worry—they’re used to me.”The flashlight beam served to increase the dogs’ frenzy: some jumped up and clawed the jeep, others started to dig in the ground for no reason, still others began to mate.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After letting the insect dealer get a little scared, I decided to do my howling imitation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For some reason, that always dispirits them and leaves them docile.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I leaned partway out the half-open window and let loose three long howls into the night sky.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"One dog nearby howled an accompaniment in a shrill, nasal voice, while another gave a plangent shriek.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer burst out laughing, his body rocking with mirth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I could certainly understand why he was laughing, and yet for someone who’d just been rescued, he seemed remarkably indiscreet.“I had a dream like this once, when was it .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"?” He changed into a pair of rubber boots, bit off the string joining a brand-new pair of work gloves, and climbed over the backrest into the front seat.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Shall I go first?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Two at a time probably wouldn’t work.”“You’re probably right, although I’ve never tried it.”“Then let me go first.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I can’t think of anything worse than hanging from a rope, with a pack of hounds snapping at my rear end.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s true, you know—round objects activate a dog’s hunting instincts.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Must be the resemblance to animals seen from behind.” One foot on the running board, eyes casting about in the dark, he said, “Howl again to distract them, will you?” I felt a sudden, inexplicable hesitation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Acquiring crew members was a matter of the deepest urgency, I knew all too well.But I had grown used to living in solitude.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Logically I was prepared to welcome the insect dealer aboard, but emotionally I was terrified.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I suspected that everything today had happened too fast.Certainly there had been times, after coming back from an outing, when the moment I inserted the key in the padlock I was assailed by an unbearable loneliness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But that never amounted to more than a fleeting spell of dizziness.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As soon as I was settled in the hold, I would return to a mood of such utter tranquillity that the concept of loneliness lost all meaning.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the words of the insect dealer—or rather of something he had parroted out of the newspaper—I had perhaps fallen prey to the confusion of symbol and reality, to the longing for a safe place to hide.“Hurry up and do your howl again,” the insect dealer urged.“I’m hungry.”“First don’t you think we’d better work out a strategy?”“What do you mean?”“Just in case they did beat us here, what are we going to do?”“You’re worrying about nothing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s impossible, isn’t it?”“Maybe.”I wasn’t in fact seriously expecting to find them there, but there were one or two signs that could have indicated an invasion during my absence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For example, that arrangement of chair legs and storage drums which I always inspected when I came back from my outings was noticeably out of order.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Probably it meant nothing, considering the heavy downpour we had just had.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Some caving in of the ground was only to be expected.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was equally possible that a cat had knocked the storage drum aside, using it as footing to escape the dogs.A series of large trailer trucks went by overhead.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When they were gone, the insect dealer said in a fed-up tone of voice, “All right, then, you want to bet?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I say they’re not here.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Are you willing to bet me they are?”“How much?”“The key to the jeep.”Ignoring this, I said, “Actually I was talking about something different—a more general question of frame of mind.Having you here is naturally going to change the way I deal with unlawful occupation, compared to before.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“If it’s general frames of mind you’re talking about, how about cleaning up your front doorstep for starters?” He gave a laugh edged in irony.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Between your garbage dump and your pack of wild dogs, I’d say you don’t have too much to worry about.Nobody’s going to break in here.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This place stinks to high heaven.Just trying to breathe gives me a headache.”“It’s the weather.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And what you smell is some disinfectant I scattered around.”“I don’t think that’s all.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Pardon me for saying so, but I suspect it has more to do with your personality, Captain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Overly defensive.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Frankly, with a captain who’s so determined to shut people out, I must say the prospect of a long voyage doesn’t offer much excitement.”“Look—if you were dealing in pots and pans or medicine bottles, you’d have an obligation to make them watertight, wouldn’t you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With a ship, it’s even more vital.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Your whole life depends on it.”“I’m not taking the shill’s part, mind you,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Don’t get me wrong.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But a ship’s captain has got to be a trifle more broad-minded, it seems to me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”“You were the one who kept insisting they were people to keep an eye on.”“You’ve got to keep an open mind.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If they managed to get inside despite all the obstacles in their way, they’d deserve a prize, wouldn’t they?”“That’s right; it would be too much for that girl, anyway.”“But then, anything you could handle—” he said, and quickly caught himself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Oops, sorry, I shouldn’t have said that.Remember now, a ship’s captain has to be tolerant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That just shows how much I really trust you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Anyway, don’t forget we live in an age when women climb the Himalayas.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Although between these dogs and this garbage dump, it might be too much for her at that.”I was starting to feel the same way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Maybe I was only jumping at shadows.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It seemed impossible that the padlock on the entrance—or the gangway, properly speaking—would be missing.Was it merely fear of shadows that had led me to acquire a weapon in the person of the insect dealer—a weapon for which I would have no use?“Okay.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If the dogs go after you, I’ll distract them,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I turned off the engine, and together we stepped out of the jeep.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I handed him a penlight, and lit the way for him with a large flashlight.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The door on the driver’s side of that car opens directly into the tunnel, so watch your head.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s about thirty feet to the entrance.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll be right behind you.”The insect dealer grabbed the rope and hauled himself up, his feet knocking down large clumps of dirt and sand at each step.This did not signify that he was any less surefooted than I; the slope was steep, and on it lay junk of all sizes and shapes, precariously piled together, each item supporting and supported by the rest.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A monkey could have done no better without knowing where the footholds were.A thin, runty black dog with long ears came sidling over to my feet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was this a newcomer, paying his respects?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Thanks to my talented howling, the pack of dogs had quickly accepted me as their leader.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
With humans it wouldn’t be so easy.I put on my rubber boots and heavy-duty gloves.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The insect dealer disappeared inside the abandoned car with a wave of his penlight.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After the rope stopped swinging, I grabbed it and followed him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As I went up, I placed my feet safely and securely in the footholds, enjoying a mild sense of superiority.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The rusted metal plate of the car door came before my eyes—beyond it gaped the mouth of the tunnel, exactly 4.83 feet square.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I could see the insect dealer’s light flickering up ahead.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Why they had chosen that exact measurement I did not know.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The entranceway itself had a steel frame, but from there on the walls were bare rock, still showing the marks of the power saw with which they had been carved out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At my feet were rusted rails, their width adjusted to that of the handcars used for hauling stone.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The tunnel cut directly under the town road, and continued another sixteen feet.Directly above the inmost part was where my biological mother had run her tobacco store—the place, incidentally, where I was born.The farther in you went, the more pronounced the acoustical alteration: high-pitched sounds created mutual interference and were absorbed into the stone walls, leaving only the deep roar of low-pitched sounds.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The howl of wind, the boom of waves, the singing of tires on the highway, all had a common denominator: the sound of a great wet canvas flapping in the wind.“Oh, no—the lock’s gone.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Come have a look.” His voice was muffled, as if he were speaking over the telephone.“It’s over on the far left, as you stand facing the latch.” He was right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The padlock was gone.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was stainless steel, a fairly big one several inches across, so there was no way we could have missed it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Someone had opened the door.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It could only be them.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Since it was a padlock, just turning the key wasn’t enough; you had to remove the whole thing from its fastening.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They certainly weren’t going to stop there and just take the thing home as a souvenir.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’d been invaded.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Bitterly, I regretted the lack of a keyhole that would have let me peer inside.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I sat cross-legged before the steel door and listened attentively.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Such a mélange of sounds came to my ears that I could hear nothing.7THE TRAPS AND THE TOILET“Looks like they’re here, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m glad we didn’t make that bet.” The insect dealer spoke in an undertone, wiping the sweat from under his chin with the tail of his shirt.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the process, his pale abdomen was exposed, revealing next to his navel a dark red birthmark the size of my palm.“I told you I wasn’t being an alarmist,” I said.“But is it really them?” he asked.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Couldn’t it be somebody else?”“Forget it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Who else has a key?”“But we didn’t see any cars parked along the way—and that shortcut would be impossible to figure out from a map.”“Maybe they took the train.”“Eh?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You never said anything about a train.”“If you can get right on the express without waiting, it’s faster.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Put out that light.”The door was heavy steel, nearly half an inch thick, so the burden on its hinges was great.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was a certain trick to opening it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You had to pull it toward you, then push it up diagonally to adjust the hingepin before it would swing open silently and smoothly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I listened, and heard only the rumble of the sea, murmurings of conches, drops of water falling—whether near or far was impossible to say.It was too quiet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I pushed the door open still farther, went inside, and stood on the cedarwood deck.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer followed behind, gripping my belt.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If what we had just come through were the gangway, this would be the hatch, not the deck.We were on the top landing of the stairs leading down into the hold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was a damp green smell, and perfect silence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Nothing more.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What had happened to the invaders?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I felt an uneasy premonition.I had not yet told the insect dealer, but the entire ship was booby-trapped to guard against trespassers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This very staircase leading down into the hold was a dangerous trap.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It appeared to be the only way down, but the boards from the fourth step to the seventh held a nasty surprise: on one side they were fastened down with a spring hinge, while the other side was left free so that anyone putting his weight on them was bound to slip and fall.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was twenty-three feet to the bottom.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
An unlucky fall could easily prove fatal.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The only safe way to go up and down was to use the ladder propped inconspicuously alongside the stairs.Assuming you managed to pass this first hurdle, you still had to get by the stairs leading up to the bridge, a sort of terrace off the first hold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"(I always refer to it as the bridge, although technically it’s my own cabin—the captain’s quarters.)",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Set foot on those stairs without first pushing the cancel button, and a fusillade of skyrockets will instantly fire.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Put a hand on the drawer of my desk, and a spray can of insecticide will go off in your face.Nor would it be wise to show any interest in the bookmark stuck invitingly in my diary: Merely reaching for it would trigger an ultraviolet warning device, sending out a shower of crushed glass I made by grinding up old light bulbs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Individual fragments are as thin as mica and as sharp as razors; once they get in your hair you can’t brush them out, and if you tried to shampoo them out, your scalp would be cut to ribbons.I had never expected any of this to be put to use.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I had thought of it lightly as a sort of protective seal on the ship until the crew officially came on board.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What got me started was a small Austrian utility machine that I bought to make duplicate keys.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
One day I used it to make a tiny screw to fasten on the sidepiece of my glasses.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Next I repaired a fountain pen, and then added some parts to a used camera.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Gradually it became a consuming passion, and I went around fixing, adding to, and remodeling everything I could lay hands on.My masterpiece was an automatic air gun.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was no ordinary air gun; apart from a slight thickness of the shaft, it looked exactly like an umbrella.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Unfortunately, there was no way to attach a sight, so I was forced to omit that feature.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As a result, it could be used only at extremely close range, and never did achieve as much as I hoped in my war on rats—the original purpose for which I’d designed it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As an umbrella, however, it functions admirably.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If I ever put it up for sale in that department store rooftop bazaar, it would certainly do better than the water cannon, anyway.But what if I did inflict injury on a trespasser, I now wondered—would I be legally responsible?After an interval that might have been two seconds, or twenty, the steel door clanged shut of its own accord, the reverberations conveying a vague sense of immense weight.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer switched his penlight on, but the shaft of light illuminated nothing; it only tapered off and disappeared, emphasizing the depth of the darkness (the room was 225’ X 100’X 60’).",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He cast his voice into the blackness.“Anybody here?”“Yes.” The response came bundled in reverberations, and the beam of a flashlight bounced back.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You kept us waiting long enough.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Hurry and turn on the lights, please.” It was the shill, no doubt about it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His voice was cheerily off key, but it had a defiant, cutting edge.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Next came the voice of the girl.“Ooh!,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It hurts,” she said, but as she was not moaning, I assumed her injuries were minor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was a relief to know they hadn’t been killed.Drawn by their voices, the insect dealer took several steps forward, lost his balance and landed heavily on his rear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The beam from his penlight, which had been aimed at the floor, was swallowed up in the darkness.“Why haven’t you got a banister here, for crying out loud?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A person could get killed.” His voice was shrill.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He coughed, cleared his throat, and said in a different key, “So it is you two.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"How’d you sneak in here?”“Hey, it’s Komono!” The girl’s voice was bright.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill must have said something to her, for she immediately started complaining again about the pain.“You two are worse than a pair of cockroaches,” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“How’d you get past the dogs?” From the swaying shadows beyond the flashlight, the shill shot back, “That’s a fine hello.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Let me ask you, then—who invited you to come poking your ugly face in here?” Plainly the three of them were well acquainted.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer hadn’t leveled with me.“You’re a fine one to talk,” countered the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I happen to know how you got your ticket—swiped it, didn’t you?”“Now, now—don’t talk that way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
One thing just led to another.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We looked all over for you, you know.”“Oh, you did, huh?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Came all the way here to look for me, did you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That was big of you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Come off it.”“As long as we pay the admission fee it’s okay, isn’t it?”“There are certain qualifications.”“Who’s asking you, Komono?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Butt out.”“Sorry, but I’ve been officially hired on by the captain here.” I was pleased to hear myself introduced as the captain right from the start.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was the insect dealer genuinely taking my part?“Captain?” said the shill.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Oh, right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’s selling boat tickets, so he’s a captain.”“Correct.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I am the captain.” Better take a firm stand here.“And since this is a rather special ship, crew members do need some rather special qualifications.”“What are Komono’s qualifications, may I ask?” The girl’s voice was tinged with sarcasm.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Ooh, it hurts.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“He’s sort of a combined adviser and bodyguard, you could say.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Are you in a lot of pain?”“My ankle is killing me.”The shill’s high-pitched, high-speed voice cut in: “Well, imagine that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With Komono your bodyguard, we’ll all have to stay on our toes, won’t we?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But you know, Captain, if it’s a bodyguard you want, then you ought to take a look at my qualifications too.Whatever I may lack in strength I can make up for in combat experience, I assure you.”The girl spoke again.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Save the fighting till after the lights are on, please.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What’s the matter with you, leaving me to suffer in the dark like this?”“The young lady does have a point; it would be nice to get the lights on,” the shill conceded.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“And she does seem to have sprained her ankle.”The young lady, he had called her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A curious yet altogether old-fashioned and charming sort of appellation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It could have been simply a nickname, yet it bore a certain air of formality that rekindled my flickering hopes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Although for all I knew, that might be exactly how he intended for me to react.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Perhaps this was more of his “fishing” gambit—a mere professional habit.“There’s no feeling at all in the toes,” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I think I may have broken the bone.”“That stairway has a couple of rotten boards in it,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I wrenched my back too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You two had better watch out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Fall the wrong way and you’ll be lucky to get off with a fracture.” Very well.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was no turning back now, anyway; I might as well accede to their request and switch on the lights.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The switch was on an infrared remote-control device hanging from my belt.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I traced along the vertical row of five buttons with my finger, tapped the top one lightly, and slid it to the right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Instantly the lights came on—fifty-six fluorescent lights, all blinking into action at once.However often I witness it, the drama of that moment never fails.Darkness itself has no spatial dimensions: the black expanse of a starless sky and the confinement of covers pulled over one’s head are equally dark.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Perhaps that explains why images we conjure in the dark seem constricted and miniature: people become dwarfs; landscapes, potted plants.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All the more reason why seeing the full aspect of the quarry interior come springing into view is as great a shock as if a mighty range of mountains had jumped full-blown out of an egg.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In some ways it’s like gazing at a three-dimensional aerial photograph, but the scale is far greater.Towering blue space.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Massive stone walls intersecting sharply, as if sliced with a knife.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Numberless horizontal lines, like marks left by the teeth of a comb—the signature of the power stonecutter blade.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The walls do not appear to be even parallelograms but seem rather to undergo a certain curvature, as if falling in toward the center, probably an effect of the uneven light cast by the wall light fixtures.When you focus on particulars, things shrink and miniaturize again: the thirty-two storage drums to my right in the corner of the hold were like scales on a carp; the shill, staring open-mouthed at the ceiling, was no bigger than my thumb.Beside him, sitting at his feet with her arms around her knees, was the girl, the size of my pinkie.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She too was sweeping her eyes across the ceiling, from end to end.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They were both dressed exactly as I had last seen them on the store rooftop—only the girl’s hair was again short.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Her own hair became her far better than the wig.“Incredible.” The insect dealer was backed up flat against the wall, barely able to speak.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He seemed afraid of heights.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I had no idea it was so huge,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“This place is like a sports stadium.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You could fit five tennis courts in here.”“This is just one small part.” Their stunned looks revived my spirits.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“My preliminary surveys indicate there are at least eighteen other holds this size.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In that wall over there to the right, past that row of storage drums, there’s a narrow opening between the pillar and the wall—see it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s the passageway to the next hold.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And on the upper left over there, that area hollowed out like a terrace is my cabin.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There’s another hole in there that you crawl through to reach another hold, and you see the place is actually a vast honeycomb of—”“What’s that thing over there?” interrupted the shill, pointing his chin toward the left-hand wall.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It scarcely needed pointing out; one’s eyes traveled there automatically, drawn by the gleam of white.“That?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s the toilet.”“The toilet?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You mean that’s the john?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s where you go?”“The design’s a little unusual, but the water pressure is terrific.”“Doesn’t it feel a little strange taking a crap right out in the open like that?”The girl clapped her hands.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Wow,” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Listen to that echo.”The insect dealer looked up, attentive to the reverberations.“If you tried singing in here, you’d sound like a pro,” he said.“We’ll pay our passage, of course,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“This is worth a lot.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Nobody’s asking for a free ride.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We’ll talk it over with you and pay a fair price.” He moistened three fingers and rubbed them on his forehead as if performing some magic rite, then added as an afterthought, “Before I forget it, Komono, you still owe me my fee for sales promotion.”Ignoring this, the insect dealer bent down to inspect the stairs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“There’s nothing rotten here,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It’s all in perfect shape.”I grabbed his elbow and pulled him back.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Watch out!,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s a trap.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This way down, over here.”The ladder was propped up in such a way that it could easily be mistaken for part of the scaffolding.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I started down first, and immediately regretted not having let the insect dealer take the lead.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Too late.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill came striding over, heels clicking on stone; he grabbed the ladder and began to shake it.“So that’s the way it was, eh?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You knew about the danger all along and did nothing to warn us.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s your fault the young lady got hurt.”My position was highly disadvantageous.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was he planning to use violence?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In any case, it wouldn’t do to betray weakness.“I had no obligation to warn you of anything.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You, sir, are in the wrong for breaking and entering.”The insect dealer leaned down from above the ladder, showing rodentlike teeth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“All right, you two,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Break it up.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In any quarrel, both sides are at fault.”“This isn’t a quarrel,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What was that supposed to mean?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He went on shaking the ladder.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I’m just trying to help.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Two injured people is enough.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We certainly wouldn’t want anything to happen to the captain.”The girl tossed in an irrelevant remark.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Is the stone in these walls really blue, or does it just look that way?” Sitting all alone in the center of the vast stone room, arms clasped around one knee, she was as conspicuous as a tin can in the center of a soccer field.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’d heard that the female sex took cold easily; would she be all right, sitting directly on the cold stone floor all this time?If her ankle was sprained, there wasn’t much else she could do.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I found her pose unbearably provocative.“It really is blue,” I told her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“That’s why it’s called waterstone.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Maybe you’ve heard of it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When it’s polished it shines like marble, but the shine doesn’t last long.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When it dries out, the surface turns powdery.”The shill let go of the ladder and stepped back, adopting a neutral stance.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer started down the ladder, calling out to the girl as he descended:“How are you doing?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Pain any better?”“No,” she shouted back.His feet were almost to my head.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There were still three rungs below me, but I jumped to the floor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shock of landing was translated into bunches of needles hammered into my knee; I staggered, and the shill held me up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer slipped past me with a smile and a pat on the shoulder, heading straight for the girl.“How’s that ankle?” he asked.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Are you okay?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Do you want to see a doctor?”“I can’t walk.”“There’s a jeep right outside.”The shill cut in impatiently, “Her bone’s broken, you know.Just how do you think she’s going to climb the ladder and hang on to the rope?”“I’ll carry her piggyback.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Fractures need attention fast.”“Don’t be an idiot.” The shill made a noise in the back of his throat like a balloon popping.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You can’t climb a rope with someone on your back.”“I used to be a member of the Self-Defense Forces.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They trained us in that sort of maneuver.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, there won’t be any climbing; on the way back it’s all downhill.”“You mean uphill.” The shill’s voice was thick with saliva; his voice quivered at the end of the sentence for lack of breath.“The way here was downhill, so they way back is uphill.”“You mean to say you two climbed down to get here?” The insect dealer shot me an accusing look out of the corner of his eye.I grew flustered.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Where from?” he demanded.“From the road overhead, of course.”“You mean the town road?”“Whatever.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The one overhead.”“There’s no rope there.”“I brought my own.” He bent down under the staircase and picked up a bag like a photographer’s case.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“See this?” he said.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I keep a set of essential tools in it.”“What for?”“Just in case.”“I see.” The insect dealer nodded, drawing an X with his large head.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“That explains how you got past the dogs.”“But how did you find your way here?” I asked.“I just showed that map to a taxi driver, and he brought us straight here.”“A taxi driver?” Hold on, mustn’t get too excited.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It would only amount to a display of weakness.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Well, that was a damn fool thing to do.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s why I didn’t want to let you have a ticket in the first place.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s the sort of person you are, I could tell.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You wreck everything—”“Calm down, please.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All I did was show him the map.”“That’s exactly what you shouldn’t have done.”“The captain does have a point.” The insect dealer squatted down comfortably on the floor next to the girl.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The fewer people who know about this, the bigger each one’s share, after all.”“It’s unpardonable.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Hand me that ticket and get out of here right now.”“But what about me?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m hurt,” the girl said forlornly, looking up at the insect dealer, beside her.The shill added deliberately, in a hard voice, “If a taxi driver is dangerous, I’m more so.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I know too much—more than any cabbie.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You can’t afford to throw me out.”The silence that followed, though short, seemed interminable.“What’s that smell?” murmured the girl.There was a smell of some kind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I had already decided it was the scent of the girl’s body—but she would hardly react to that herself.“Maybe it’s the bleaching power I use for disinfectant.”“No.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I have a very good nose.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This is more like .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"burned soy sauce.Simultaneously we three men began to stick our noses up and swing our heads around as we sniffed the air.“Do you know, you’re right; I had squid with soy sauce for dinner yesterday.”“Not spear squid, was it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The ones around here are fit for a king.” The insect dealer’s voice was eager, and he spoke with that twitch of the soft palate that comes when one is fondly recalling a particular taste.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Good raw too.”“As a matter of fact, I fried up the leftovers of some I ate raw the night before.”“Look, will you hurry and call an ambulance, please,” the girl begged, drawing out the vowel at the end of the sentence as if she were singing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It really seemed as much a test of the echo as a cry of exasperation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was about to tell her that it was out of the question; the insect dealer opened his mouth too, apparently on the verge of some similar remark; but it was the shill who said it first:“Forget it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We can’t possibly do that.”“Oh, I know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Never mind.” She gave in without a fight.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If you’re trying to avoid contact with the outside world, then it doesn’t make sense to call an ambulance, does it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But God, it’s killing me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“Oh, let me give this back to you before I forget,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He took my padlock out from a compartment in his bag and threw it at me all of a sudden, though we were barely an arm’s length apart.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I missed it, and it fell to the floor—but there was no clank when it hit the stone.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was still twirling around the shill’s finger.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
More parlor tricks.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This time he passed it slowly into my palm.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You can never be too careful with a lock, can you?” he said.“How about the key, while you’re at it?”“Sure thing.” He fumbled in his pocket.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Komono, you give back yours too.”“All right.” Without the slightest hesitation, the insect dealer tossed over his passkey, which flew in a precise parabola, landing smack in the shill’s hand before being transferred to mine.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was not impressed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Such virtuoso performances leave me cold.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s always the same: the ball goes back and forth, back and forth, in a quick, light rhythm .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"and then before I know it, somebody switches it for a hand grenade; I catch it, and that’s the end of the game.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had recovered the padlock and keys, but in return I had been forced to acknowledge that the shill and the girl would stay.“Just tell me when you want out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll open the door right up.”“No problem.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I have no pressing commitments.” He sucked in a bit of saliva at the corner of his mouth.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Besides, in here you don’t have to worry about bill collectors chasing after you.”“That’s right,” the insect dealer chimed in.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Everybody laughed but me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The girl began massaging her ankle as if she’d just remembered.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I could see right through her little ruse, but there seemed no point in bringing it up.“Doesn’t anybody know a good doctor?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Someone discreet, who makes house calls.”“Yes, we’ll need a ship’s doctor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Ships always have one, you know.” The shill sought the insect dealer’s concurrence; the insect dealer nodded.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Not only should he be exempted from paying a fare; he should be paid a salary.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Does anybody know a good person?”I did, but I didn’t want to say so.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“For now, why don’t you let me have a look at that leg?” I offered.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I used to work for the fire department.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can at least tell a sprain from a fracture.” Again everybody laughed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I could only join in, estimating as I did so the distance between her and me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A good eighteen to twenty paces.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The thing to do was to stroll over casually, timing it so that as I finished talking I was right by her side.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If all went well, I might be able to touch her leg without anybody stopping me.“They make you learn first-aid procedures even if you’re not a member of the emergency squad,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Things like splinting a fracture or administering artificial respiration—but this is a bit uncomfortable, so why don’t we go to my cabin?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It has a sofa and some cushions.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Nothing too fancy, but comfortable.” Just as planned, I maneuvered myself into place directly opposite the insect dealer, with the girl between us.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She nodded and raised her right arm high, signaling that she wanted to lean on my shoulder.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Unbelievably, she had accepted my invitation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I knelt down by her side on the left, scarcely breathing, like someone slipping a windfall in change into his pocket.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Such a chance would never come again.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I could not afford to worry about what anyone else might think.Her hand rested on my right shoulder.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This was no fantasy, but a real woman’s hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The sensation was so novel that I can scarcely describe it; if anything, it felt as if someone had applied an icy flatiron to the surface of my brain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Under the circumstances, no one could have objected if I slipped an arm around her waist, but I forbore, content merely to imagine what it would be like.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As I stood up, a hand reached in my crotch and tickled my balls.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It had to be the insect dealer.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I ignored it.The shill had gone ahead toward the bridge—my cabin.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He kicked at the toilet below the stairs and let out a nervous laugh.These people laughed a lot for no good reason.“Sure looks like a toilet,” he said.“It is one,” I said.The insect dealer caught up with the shill and peered over his shoulder.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“This is a special-order size.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Are you sure it isn’t for horses?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Does it work?”“Of course it does.”“You must be some kind of exhibitionist.” The shill leaned against a stick beside the toilet.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“How you could drop your drawers here, in such an open place, is beyond me.” What he had leaned against was a steel rod sticking up out of the floor like a railway switch; it looked like something to grab for support, but actually it was the flush lever.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Before I could warn him, the lever moved, and he staggered back.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"An earthshaking tremor arose, as if a subway were roaring in.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The noise was concentrated in the core of the toilet, as if it had been passed through a parabolic lens and magnified.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"An instant later, water came surging in with a cloud of spray, rose up just level with the bowl, formed a whirlpool, and vanished with another roar.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was a wet noise of rupture, then a hush.“How awful.” Shaking my shoulder, the woman emitted a soundless laugh.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Judging from the way she carried herself, the ankle was certainly not broken.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I doubted if it was even sprained.That was fine with me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I only wanted to stay forever the way we were.“That water pressure is ridiculous!” The insect dealer looked back at me and said sharply, “Is this really a john?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s big enough to service ten elephants—all at the same time.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The shape is funny too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I mean, it looks sort of like a john, but it’s really not, is it?”“Well, who says that all toilets have to look alike?” I countered.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“There’s no law, is there?” I wasn’t dead sure myself.Maybe it was something else.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was bigger than your ordinary facility, and higher; its back was indistinguishable from its front, and it was unusually wide.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The absence of a seat made it difficult to straddle and hard to keep your balance.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was also a peculiar shape: the heavy porcelain bowl rested like a giant tulip on stainless-steel pipes protruding from the floor.My first encounter with this toilet went back to the time I was confined here under suspicion of rape, and my biological father, Inototsu, had chained me to those very pipes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Every prison cell needs some sort of facility for disposing of human waste.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The men at work nearby (who regarded me with a mixture of disgust and awe for having supposedly committed rape so young) used to share their lunches with me and then relieve themselves right in front of me without batting an eyelash, while I was still eating.Also, they would dispose of cigarette butts, the paper bags they brought their lunches in, things like that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sometimes they would drag over a cat carcass or a bug-infested cushion and flush it away.Kittens could fit in whole, and the mother cat could be managed either by hammering the body to bits or by severing it in two.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was doubtless constructed in such a way as to take advantage of different water levels underground—but why and how it generated such tremendous pressure I never understood.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Despite its mystery, it was in fact all-powerful, capable of washing anything away.“If you say so.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But I wish you’d put a screen around it, anyway,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Moving on ahead, he laid a hand on the banister of the steps leading up to the bridge.“Watch out!” I yelled, pulling away from the woman’s arm.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I grabbed the shill’s shirt and hauled him back.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Please don’t go anywhere or touch anything without first checking with me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I told you there are booby traps everyplace.”As I spoke, skyrockets went off at the top of the stairs, exploding as they hit the floor, and sending out a cloud of orange smoke.“What in hell was that?” The shill’s voice was shrill and unnerved.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The woman made a sound like a whistling teakettle.“I’d say you’ve gone a little overboard.” The insect dealer spoke slowly and decisively.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“That’s going too far.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Sheer paranoia.” He signaled me with his eyes all the while he spoke.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I couldn’t get what he had in mind, but he was apparently seeking some sort of carte blanche.“Relax.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Registered crew members will be informed of all booby traps aboard the ship.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If necessary, I can turn off the power as a safety precaution.”I turned around, intending to offer the woman my shoulder again—only to find that the insect dealer had swiftly stepped forward and wrapped his arm around her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She was compliant, showing no signs of resisting.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The shill looked away with a faint smile.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That was a dirty trick.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But I was the only one who had the right to put a compress on her ankle.8THE WATERY TASTE OF DISAPPOINTMENTGROWS AS FAMILIARAS A PAIR OF OLD SHOESIt was a steep stone staircase, six and a half feet wide, with twenty-three steps in all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The banister was a square-cut log of cryptomeria.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At the top, on the right, was a stone pillar some thirty inches square, and in the back a parapet twenty inches high.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The bridge (also known as the forward observation deck—my quarters) formed an elongated diamond some 235 square feet in area.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The walls were open, balcony style.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Living here alone with my imaginary crew, I had taken pleasure in the uninterrupted view, and in the sense of spaciousness (besides, I had foolproof measures in place to guard against surprise attack).",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But community life, it now struck me, would necessitate the acquisition of heavy curtains.I led the way, followed by the girl on the insect dealer’s arm, with the shill bringing up the rear.“What a mess!” exclaimed the insect dealer, his voice an unconvincing shriek of dismay.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“A junkman’s backyard has nothing on this.”He needn’t have said anything; I was quite aware of the room’s shocking state.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had not planned on bringing anyone here for some time yet, and so everything was in the same topsy-turvy order as my own brain cells, scarcely fit to withstand the cold scrutiny of outsiders.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I gnashed my teeth to think that if only I had known they were coming, I could have straightened things up and made the place more presentable.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Both the TV and the stereo were fairly new models, but the effect this might have had was lost.“Considering how messy things are, though,” I said defensively, “you’ll notice there’s very little dust.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The square box at the head of the stairs is a dust-collecting machine that I invented.It works pretty well.”“That you invented, you say?” the shill said mockingly, looking from me to the box and back again.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was a plastic box approximately twenty by twenty by eight inches; a fluffy covering of dust made it appear to be wrapped in old felt.“Instead of an ordinary filter system, I used the adsorption power of static electricity.”“Oh, yeah?” The shill’s voice picked up with interest.Perhaps he was a more reasonable fellow than I had given him credit for being.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“A dust remover using static electricity?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s a new one on me.”“It is new; I thought it up.”“It makes good sense, theoretically.” He squatted down in front of the machine, while I ran over to the chaise longue shoved against the wall and swept off a motley pile of old newspapers and magazines to make room for the girl.“Never mind that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Get a load of this room, will you?” The insect dealer groaned, his teeth clenched, as he kicked three bananas and a bag of peanuts under the table.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Looks like a cross between a pawnshop and a den of thieves.”Supported by the insect dealer, the girl sat down on the chaise longue, holding one leg straight out before her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Still with his arm around her, the insect dealer sat down too, snuggling close against her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He bounced playfully on the old springs, then gave his own face a slap and muttered, “Shame on you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Behave yourself.”The shill, still squatting in front of the dust collector, paid no attention.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Is all this stuff on top dust?” he asked.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Pretty clever.You know something?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’re a lot brainier than you look.” I took no offense.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Well, after all, it’s not as if your brain gets fat.”“It’s making a noise.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Is something rotating inside?”“To ensure uniform contact with the air, I have it set to rotate five times a minute, while the wool and nylon brushes inside turn in the opposite direction at ten times that speed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The friction creates static electricity.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I set it right at the point where air currents intersect.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Seems to work all right, as far as I can tell.”“I suppose you’ve already applied for a patent.”“Why would I want to do that?”“No ambition?” He wiped the corner of his mouth dry with the palm of his hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Don’t throw away your talents.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Remember that sale at the department store today?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
An item like this could have gone over big.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Right, Komono?”“Yes, sir—the captain here is a great man, all right.” His answer came too readily.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His glasses had fogged over, obscuring his expression, but he obviously had no real interest in the dust collector.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was this some sort of dodge, to put the shill off guard?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
People lacking in curiosity are said to be unfeeling.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Had his original air of introspection been a deliberate act, just a way of getting himself aboard the ship?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It wouldn’t do to expect a lot of him as my bodyguard, and wind up paying for it in the end.Meanwhile, a few amendments seemed in order on my impressions of the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Generally, it’s money and material goods that win society’s respect, while intangible assets like inventiveness and resourcefulness get short shrift.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After all the interest I’d shown in his eupcaccia, the insect dealer went on treating me like some kind of kook.Come to think of it, the rest of the eupcaccias were still out in the jeep.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’d have to remember to bring them in later.The girl began swaying, probably from the effort of holding her leg up in midair.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer made a move to get up, planning evidently to go over and support her leg himself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He was mistaken if he thought I was going to let such a prize go to him.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I planted myself in front of him, blocking his way at close range.One or the other of us would have to step aside.“Relax, relax—I wouldn’t do anything to offend you.” He gave my shoulder a light pat and moved aside.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then, heading toward the back of the room, he walked by the five steel lockers next to the chaise longue, snapping a finger against each one in turn.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He stopped in front of two bookcases that intersected at an angle of 120 degrees and looked back at me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Avoiding his eyes, I knelt in front of the girl, a little to one side.“Does it still hurt?”“Naturally.”She clasped her hands under her knee and pulled her arms back, lifting her leg so that her artificial leather skirt peeled back to the top of the thigh.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Fine soft hair covered flesh even rounder and richer than I had imagined.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I pulled out a first-aid kit from underneath the chaise longue.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The room might look chaotic, but it had a certain orderliness of its own: things were strewn in concentric circles around the chaise longue in order of usefulness, distance being in inverse proportion to necessity or frequency of use.“Hold out your leg straight, and relax,” I said, and brought my two palms up to the calf of her leg.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She let out an exaggerated scream.“Stop it!,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That tickles!”“Don’t scare me like that.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m just trying to examine you.” The shill glanced our way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Examine, huh.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s a good one.” Slowly he stood up in front of the dust collector and swallowed, Adam’s apple bobbing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Setting both hands on the end of the desk-table that took up half the available space, he leaned forward slightly in a pose of unmistakable menace.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If you’re going to give first aid, just keep it cold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Make a cold compress out of a wet towel, and wrap a bandage around it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s all.”“Wrong.” Rubbing the cover of a large book he had taken from the bookcase, the insect dealer shook his big head.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Not cold.You’ve got to use a hot compress.”“Are you crazy?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Everybody knows you pack a sprain in ice.” The shill was adamant.“No, it’s heat you want.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Hot compresses are the best.” The insect dealer was not about to give ground, either.Let them fight it out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
In the meantime I had a clear field.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was a golden chance—one I had no intention of wasting.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Without the least hesitation, I slid my hands confidently along the curve of her calf, and this time she made no sound.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had to act as if I knew what I was doing; a gingerly approach would only backfire.“Leave it to me,” I said, hands now firmly in place, as I savored the sensation of her flesh against mine.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I learned all about it when I was a firefighter.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You chill a fracture, but you apply heat to a sprain.”The girl’s finger touched the back of my hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I thought she was going to push me away, but that didn’t seem to be her aim.Never leaving my hand, her finger began to crawl along it like a wingless insect.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Now it was my turn to feel ticklish.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But it was a ticklishness I could happily endure.“Why do they take X-rays at a hospital?” she asked.“What do you mean?”“It’s because otherwise they can’t be sure if the bone’s broken or not, right?”“I guess so.”“Then isn’t this just a waste of time?”The question was a heavy blow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill laughed, spraying saliva from between his teeth like an atomizer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer shut his book with a bang.“Tell me,” he said, “what made you become a firefighter, of all things?”“Nothing special.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You know, when you’re a kid you dream about what you want to be when you grow up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I wanted to be a fireman, that’s all.”All three of them burst out laughing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“All right, what were you doing in the Self-Defense Forces, of all things?” I countered.Instead of answering, he took off his glasses and wiped them on his shirttail.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“My glasses are fogged up all the time.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It must really be humid in here.”I stayed serene.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The reason was that casually, secretly, the girl’s fingers were rubbing the back of my hand in rhythmic circles.“It’s humid, but it feels comfortable, doesn’t it?” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“As if a cooler were on.”Fortunately, her hands were shadowed by my body, so that neither the shill nor the insect dealer seemed aware of what she was doing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I hadn’t known that secret pleasures could be so exciting.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Warm air blew into my ear, and emerged from my nostril.My blood pressure must be zooming.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What I could not comprehend was the meaning of the signal coming through her fingers.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was she uncommonly sympathetic, or had the shill merely conditioned her to flirt with whoever was at hand?“Now that you mention it, it is cool.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m dry as a bone.” The shill put a hand under his shirt and rapped his chest several times.“But if it’s humid all year round, the air gets full of air mites.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Terrible for your respiratory organs.” The insect dealer threw in a cavil in his know-it-all tone of voice.“Air mites?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s a good one.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Typical,” said the shill.“I’m not making it up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Don’t you read the paper?” He held out a book horizontally, making it swim like a fish.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“They’re one-hundredth of an inch across, like microscopic jellyfish; look in any encyclopedia.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They float in the air and feed on dust particles.They’ll reproduce in your lungs and bring on a nasty inflammation.”Paying no attention to this exchange, the shill skirted the table and peered down into the hold over the parapet opposite the chaise longue.“What’s inside those storage drums down there?” he asked.“I’ve been meaning to ask ever since I got here.”“Five are full of drinking water.” My voice was thick, as if spread with glue.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The girl’s continued massaging of the back of my hand had swollen the mucous membranes of my throat.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“In an emergency, there’s got to be plenty of water, right?”“This place is swimming in water.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Look at this book—you could practically wring it out.” The insect dealer held the spine of the book at either end and twisted it; the cover came off and the contents fell to the floor.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Oops, sorry.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Looks like an interesting book—A Manual for Self-Sufficiency, it’s called.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Whoever wrote it must be a real nut, to worry about self-sufficiency in this day and age.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Say, this is a library book, isn’t it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Aren’t you going to take it back?”I had no obligation to answer.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was on the verge of remembering something far more important.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Uses for bundles of printed paper, old newspapers, old magazines .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That was it—a cast.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Until a plaster cast was available, you could use them as temporary substitutes, to immobilize an injured joint.“You know, I like it here,” announced the shill, leaning slightly forward to seat himself on the parapet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He continued in a loud and enthusiastic voice.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“To be honest, at first I just wanted a look at the place, out of sheer curiosity.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But this is great!Absolutely fascinating.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Who cares about a little humidity?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
High humidity is typical of underground space; all you have to do is think of some way to put it to use.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Having the winters warm and the summers cool, with a fixed temperature year round, could be extremely useful, it seems to me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just to take an obvious example, it’s perfect for storing vegetables or grain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or maybe unhulled rice and seeds would be better.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The price is high, and there’s a stable demand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”Too pedestrian.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was like seeing a diamond in a king’s crown and associating it with mere glass-cutting.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This sort of man could become a great nuisance.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It struck me now that the noncommittal insect dealer was the safer of the two.“Nobody tells me what to do.” Numbness in my leg blunted my tone.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I raised my eyebrows, tightened my grip on the girl’s calf, and said, “For now, anyway, let’s make a cast.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Whether it’s a fracture or a sprain, the most important thing is to keep the injured area immobile.”“That’s all right for now, but what happens after that?” he said.The girl’s calf twitched slightly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Without hesitation, the insect dealer came butting in.“It’s all settled, isn’t it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll climb down with her on my back.” He put a cigarette in his mouth, then returned it to the pack unlit.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You two came down here from the highway, but the real way in is along the shore.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There’s a jeep waiting outside, so relax and let me take care of things.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll just have a cup of coffee before we go.”“Takes you a while to catch on, doesn’t it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’re a bit slow—like an old fluorescent light.” The shill dragged out his words for greater effect.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“This place is so top-secret we can’t even call an ambulance, right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If I were the captain, I can tell you I wouldn’t want to grant any shore leaves, either, not unless it was to a trusty who had really proved himself.”“You stay here as hostage, then,” the insect dealer said easily, with a wink at me, seeking my approval.Taken by surprise, I was unable to decide quickly whether his suggestion would work to my advantage or not.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If she were the hostage, it would be a different matter; but was there any conceivable advantage in being left alone with the shill?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She might disappear, stuck fast to the insect dealer’s back, and never return.“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” The shill sucked in his saliva with an offensive sound.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Just look at the captain’s face.Talk about black looks .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“Shall we be off ?” Unperturbed, the insect dealer addressed the girl across my shoulder.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It might have been the angle, but all of him—not just the dome of his head—looked a size bigger than normal.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Captain, will you see us out to the jeep?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can’t handle those dogs alone.”“Dogs?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What dogs?” The girl gave my hand a light pinch.“A pack of hungry strays.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We took our lives in our hands getting in here.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There must be five or six really ferocious ones.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But there’s nothing to worry about: the captain here does a great imitation of a dog’s howl, and the moment they hear that they calm right down.”My hand, covered with sweat, felt as obscene as if it had been coated with lubricant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer was standing now where he could see our hands, but he said nothing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was he intentionally overlooking it?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In that case, his request that I see them out to the jeep took on a deeper significance: I would be one of those to leave rather than stay, and my wish to see the shill excluded would be brilliantly fulfilled.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was an ingenious idea.Once the padlock was locked from the outside, the shill would never again set foot aboveground.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"How long he could stay alive would depend on when, and whether, he found the provisions.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If he never did, then he would certainly die in a matter of weeks.Even if he did find provisions, he would probably fall in one of the anti-invader traps and be fatally injured.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I could dispose of the body single-handed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Chopped in pieces and flushed down that high-pressure toilet, it would be gone without a trace in a matter of minutes.Perhaps I should trust the insect dealer, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was like facing a broken traffic signal that blinked red, then green, then red, then green, over and over.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I hesitated, unable to decide whether to step on the brake or the accelerator.“First let me get that cast on,” I said, and reached out for the pages of the Manual for Self-Sufficiency, which lay strewn across the floor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The floor spun and I toppled over.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My leg had fallen asleep from spending such a long time in an unaccustomed position.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The girl, despite her supposed injury, dodged and sprang to her feet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The shill exploded into laughter with the suddenness of a cork popping off a bottle of champagne.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The water cannon on the department store rooftop, which hadn’t attracted a single buyer, would probably fire its projectile with a similar noise, I thought.“All right, miss, you can quit acting now.” The shill snapped his fingers and jumped nimbly from the parapet to the floor.“That’s enough.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Time to take a break.”“You mean she was faking?” Slowly the insect dealer planted his feet wide apart, exuding menace.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I remained surprisingly calm.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Things never go the way you plan them, except in fantasies.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The watery taste of disappointment was as familiar as a pair of old shoes.“You knew it all along.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Stop bullshitting,” replied the shill, wiping the corner of his mouth with a fingertip.Feeling began returning to my leg, with such discomfort that I could not have borne the touch of a fly’s wing.“Now this is going too far.” Looking grim, the insect dealer removed his glasses, slumped forward, and rubbed the area between his brows.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“We have an agreement with the captain here.You can’t get away with this.”Not to be outdone, the shill pressed his elbows tightly against his sides, crouched over, and lowered his head.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Except for their tense breathing, it was as if each had withdrawn inside his own shell, ignoring the other.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Wild animals feign the same indifference as they sharpen their claws, waiting for a chance to pounce.“You’re going to have to throw me out, you know.”“I know.”“Pretty sure of yourself.”The insect dealer folded his glasses and dropped them in his pocket.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The shill stuck the fingers of his right hand in his pants pocket.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Did he have a concealed knife?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They stood twelve feet apart, with the corner of the table between them.The girl stepped on my foot and whispered, “Do you suppose it’s still raining outside?”In that taut atmosphere, her whisper stood out like a piece of dirt in the eye.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The men’s excitement ended abruptly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer put a fist to his mouth and coughed, while the shill went on clicking his tongue.“The walls are thick and there are no windows, so for both weather and time we have to rely on instruments.” I switched on the monitor sitting on the middle shelf of the bookcase between the couch and the locker.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Electric signals from the outdoor sensor were translated by computer into symbols that flashed on the screen.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Looks like the rain is over.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Wind velocity is thirteen point eight feet per hour, coming out of the southwest.”“You’re really something, Captain.” The shill’s gaze swept me boldly up and down.“Humidity index is eighty-two.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Air pressure’s still low and falling.”“That’s why my head feels so heavy,” the girl said, sweeping the hair off her forehead.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Anyone else want a cup of coffee?”“Not a bad idea.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Take the bad taste out of our mouths.” The insect dealer relaxed a bit.“Everything you do, Komono, is so phony it leaves a bad taste in the mouth,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To the girl he said, “To celebrate your recovery, miss, how about fixing us all a cup of coffee?” His motive was transparent: by having her help out, he meant to settle the issue of whether they stayed or went, by means of a fait accompli.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Captain, would you mind showing her where the coffee and everything is?”“Never mind, I’ll get it myself,” I said.The girl glanced at the shill to ascertain what he wanted her to do.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He urged her on with brisk waves of his hand, as if chasing a fly.“Let me do it,” she said, her voice suddenly animated as if in amends for malingering.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I make a mean cup of coffee.”“Yes, but it’s an electric coffeemaker, so it comes out the same no matter who does it,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I too had an ulterior motive: this was it, my chance to be alone with her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Why don’t you help me wash up some cups instead?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All that sort of thing I do downstairs, by the toilet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Cooking and laundry too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I don’t use the toilet water, you understand—there’s a sink built into the wall, with its own faucet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The coffee-maker only makes three cups.We’ll just have to brew it a little stronger, and then add hot water.” She smoothed her skirt and led the way, motioning for me to follow.“I don’t like violence.” The insect dealer stood aside, taking a kamaboko stick from a pouch on his belt and offering it to me as I went by.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Want one?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the confusion, I forgot all about them.Coffee on an empty stomach is bad for the system, you know.Upsets the nerves, and it can make you constipated too.” I took four and dashed after the girl, dragging the leg that was still partially numb.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Three steps down, we entered the shadow of a pillar, out of sight of the bridge.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The shill’s voice sounded.“What a crazy machine.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What the heck is this for, sharpening rats’ teeth?”“It’s a small precision machine tool,” replied the insect dealer, his mouth stuffed with kamaboko.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You know, I’ve always wanted to play with one of these.”9BACK TO THE POT“Really, the more you look at this toilet, the stranger it is.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"..” The girl spoke in a nasal whisper that sounded almost deliberately provocative.I had to agree with her about the toilet, all right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Squatting over it, you were totally unprotected, longing desperately for a cover behind, or just for some way to tell front from back.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In a place as vast as this old quarry, the anus developed rejection symptoms even with a wall behind you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When I first started living here, constipation was my bane.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I tried all kinds of laxatives, to no avail.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After a week my ears were ringing; by the tenth day my vision was clouding over.I tried enemas, but that only made it worse: they gave me the urge to go, and that’s all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My sphincter remained stubbornly corked.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To feel an intense urge to evacuate—a violent one, I should say, as in intestinal catarrh—and to be incapable of doing anything about it is an excruciating form of suffering that must be experienced to be believed.At the hospital they brushed it off lightly: “If you feel like moving your bowels, that only proves you have a light case, so don’t rush yourself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just keep sitting on the toilet.” They needn’t have told me that; the moment I got off I would feel the summons of nature, and tear straight back again.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For two whole days I sat there leafing through the Family Medical Book, convinced that death was imminent.The Family Medical Book was written for laymen, as the title suggests, but in the end it provided the solution.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
At least it gave better advice than the doctors.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Mention constipation and generally they’ll ascribe it to one of two causes: desiccation and hardening of the stool, or poor muscle tone.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Intestinal malfunction, in short.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But in the Family Medical Book, as an example of intestinal hyperfunction the authors mention difficulty in evacuation due to a spastic rectum—a type of constipation not even listed in the constipation section.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I felt a flash of light.Despite my large bulk, I am of surprisingly nervous temperament, and two or three times a year (when I must meet with someone unpleasant, such as my biological father, Inototsu, or when I’m called to traffic court for a violation), I come down with diarrhea.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When the symptoms worsen I am attacked by severe pain, as if my bowels were being twisted and wrung.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If this constipation had resulted from an especially acute case of diarrhea, I reasoned, then it might pay to try my regular medicine.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"(In fact, it’s a drug to relieve menstrual cramps, but I find it wonderfully effective for an irritable colon.)",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The results were dramatic: in minutes, an enormous movement erupted, leaving only a delightful sense of hollowness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Thinking he might be interested, I did mention this to the doctor, but his only reaction was a look of faint annoyance.That time of suffering did, however, enable me to grow accustomed to the vastness of the quarry.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides losing my fear of constipation, I became able to straddle the toilet forward, backward, or sideways, from any angle.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I even became relaxed enough to contemplate other uses for the thing.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"More and more frequently, I used it for garbage disposal.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Soon I was using the sink and counter to prepare food.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Waiting for the contents of a pan to heat, I could seat myself on the toilet in comfort.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even while eating my meals and drinking my coffee, I had no need to go elsewhere.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I could do my aerial-photography traveling, or go over the results of the day’s surveying, right while drinking coffee on the pot.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And so the toilet came gradually to occupy a central place in my life.Metaphorically speaking, I was beginning to change into a eupcaccia.The galley was a hollow in the wall, about a meter off the floor; inside, it had been polished to a blue, enamel-like finish that deserved to be set off by a loving cup, if I’d had such a thing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Once, on the ceiling there, I found some bumps that had been puttied over.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Prying with a knife, I uncovered a lead pipe whose end was capped.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When I unscrewed the cap, water came gushing out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I installed a faucet, electric wiring and a socket.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then I added a small refrigerator and a fluorescent light, a large electric stove, a kitchen cabinet, and a foldout counter.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When I wasn’t using it, I kept the area hidden behind accordion curtains.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Finally I added a high enclosed shelf you reached by standing on the toilet; rubber sealing made it airtight.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Up there is where I keep my camera equipment and travel necessities (i.e., the aerial photos), surveying equipment and so on, protected by drying agents.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My safety precautions are airtight too: I set it up so that if you touch the door handle without first flicking a hidden switch, an electric shock will burn your fingers, and tear gas will go off in your face.The spot right next to the camera equipment would be a good place to keep the eupcaccias.I opened the curtain, which made the lights go on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“How pretty!” she exclaimed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It’s like marble.”“Actually it’s something called hydrous shale; as long as it stays moist, it has a nice shine.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s probably an underwater stone.The only trouble with it is that when it dries out, it gets covered with fine powder.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After four or five years, buildings decorated with it look as if they’ve been dusted with confectioner’s sugar.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In fact, that probably explains why the quarry closed down.”“Hmm,” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It certainly lacks a woman’s touch.” She looked at five days’ worth of dirty dishes piled in the sink and laughed.“Of course it does.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What else did you expect?”“Want me to wash these up for you?”“That’s all right, I always do it once a week, without fail.” I stuck one of the kamaboko from the insect dealer in my mouth, and gave another to her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“They’re not chilled, but we just bought them a little while ago, so I’m sure they’re all right.”“Thank you.” Like thin rubber, the girl’s lips expanded and contracted, following the shape of the kamaboko.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“These are high in protein and low in fat, so they’re very good for you,” she said.“Oh, I’m incorrigible.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve given up.” Talking openly about my weaknesses, I figured, would make me come across as a frank and likable type.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“But this is mostly monosodium glutamate held together with starch.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Glutamic acid soda is sodium chloride, so it could be bad for your blood pressure.”“Can you hear something?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Like dogs barking?” the girl said.“You can hear anything here if you try hard enough,” I answered.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“This place is so full of tunnels and caves, it’s like being in the middle of a gigantic trumpet.”“It’s like one of those foreign movies on TV.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There’s always a house—a big stone building with an iron fence, right?—and a big yard and a watchdog.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If this were a movie, the story would just be getting under way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All we need is some music.”“You’re different,” I told her.“How?”“I mean different in a nice way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Interesting.”“Don’t tease me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’s forever groaning about me—says I have holes in my head.”“He’s disgusting.”“Maybe that’s why he is the way he is—because he knows people don’t like him.”“What do you mean, ‘the way he is’?”“How many cups’ worth of grounds shall I put in?”“Five, if you like it strong.” Perhaps because of the peculiar nature of where we were, sandwiched between the kitchen sink and the toilet, I began to feel an excitement attended by visual stricture, like that of a child playing in closets.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I’ll tell you what I don’t like about him.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s his attitude toward you—he’s so damned overbearing.”“I know, but he’s sick, so what can I do?”“Sick?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What’s the matter with him?”“Cancer.”Mentally I reviewed my impressions of the shill, as if starting again at page one of a book I’d read partway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“What kind of cancer?”“Bone marrow.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s evidently a kind of leukemia.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Don’t tell anyone, okay?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He doesn’t even know about it yet himself.”“Is it serious?”“Isn’t cancer always?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They give him six months to live.”“Tell me the truth.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What’s your relationship to him?”“It’s hard to say exactly.”“Why does he call you ‘young lady’?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Isn’t that a bit formal?”“Probably he does it to excite people’s imaginations.”“More fishing?”“I don’t know; maybe.”“But the only ones to be told the truth about a cancer patient’s condition are the next of kin.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Isn’t that so?” I felt a rising irritation that was totally at odds with the thrill of being alone with her like two children snuggled in a closet.Instead of answering, she looked up and waved.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill and the insect dealer were standing side by side, elbows on the bridge parapet, munching on kamaboko and looking down at us.“You want your coffee up there?” she asked.“Nah, we’ll come on down.” The insect dealer placed his hands on the small of his back and stretched.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Less trouble that way, and easier to clean up.”“No, let’s have it up here.” Waving both hands, the shill disappeared in the recesses of the bridge, then rounded the pillar and came down the stairs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“But first I’ve got to use the john.”“You can’t—me first!” the girl exclaimed, thrusting at him a tray piled with four clean cups, no two alike.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I’ll bring the coffee up as soon as the water boils.”What could we say?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Wordlessly the shill took the tray and withdrew, and I followed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Together we laid the cups out near one corner of the table.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer called down to her over the parapet:“Got anything to eat down there?”Her voice came echoing back, colored by the reverberation.“Hey!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No peeking.” I detected a note of playfulness that I found distasteful.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A half-smile lingering on the corner of his mouth, the insect dealer turned away with visible regret.“Let’s eat, Captain,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I can’t talk on an empty stomach.”I was hungry too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The problem as I saw it was to decide what kind of meal we should have; it might well have a profound impact on our future relationships.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Broadly speaking, there were three possibilities: the four of us could share a simple meal of instant noodles; we could sit down to a slightly more substantial meal, in a spirit of welcome to the new crew (in that case, we would need more booze); or I could take them all to the food storehouse, where they could each pick out what they wanted, at their own expense.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In that case, everybody would be on their own.Personally, I favored the last option, but seeing that living quarters had not yet been formally assigned, it might set some unfortunate precedents.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
An enjoyable welcome party might serve as an effective social lubricant for all the various relationships among us.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If there was some guarantee I could talk to the girl without worrying constantly about the shill, I certainly had no objection to opening a bottle or two of sake.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Right now, in order to settle my mind, I needed time for another cup of coffee.“Is this where you sleep, Captain?” asked the shill, tapping an armrest of the chaise longue.“Yes—why?”“What about us?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Where do we sack out?”“For now, anyplace.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I have sleeping bags for everybody.”“Well, in that case, you’ll have to excuse me for a while.Sorry,” said the shill.With people switching back and forth all the time this way, how could I formulate any plan?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I decided to stop worrying about the dinner menu.“Nothing to be sorry about.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Do as you please,” I said.“I can’t help it,” the shill said, explaining, “I can’t get to sleep without my own pillow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Always carry it with me on trips.”“That’s ridiculous.”“No, it isn’t.” The insect dealer was stuck to the edge of the chaise longue like a half-dried squid.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It doesn’t have to be a particularly soft one, or anything.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But there are people with attachments to a certain pillow.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It must be the smell of their own hair oils, absorbed into the pillow.”“Pillows pick up smells, all right, that’s for sure,” agreed the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Ever stay in a cheap hotel somewhere in the sticks?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s enough to make you gag.”“Of all the senses, they say the sense of smell is the most primitive,” said the insect dealer.“Other people’s smells may be unbearable, but your own never are,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Everyone has a certain affection for their own body odors.”“That’s true,” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Ever see somebody scratch his dandruff, and then sniff the dirt under his nails?”“Please, would you both just be quiet?” I was fed up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I certainly had never expected life with a crew to be so bothersome.“I went a long time without hearing any human voices here,” I went on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Now it’s a strain on my nerves.”Would the old quiet never return?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This arrangement was scarcely worth the trouble.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Did any of them have the slightest idea of the enormous price I was paying?We heard a sudden gush of water.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The girl had begun to urinate.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I hadn’t expected the noise to carry so well.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It took little effort to imagine the precise amount and pressure of liquid released.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It sounded as close as a cricket would have sounded, chirping under the chaise longue.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Too late, I regretted having asked them to be silent.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All three of us pulled at our ears, sucked air through our molars, and pretended not to hear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The sound continued unendingly, until I could no longer endure it.“Anytime people begin living together, there have got to be some rules.” My words serving as a substitute for ear-plugs, I jabbered on at a speed even I found offensive to the ear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“And rules aren’t rules unless they’re kept.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And in order for them to be kept, they must be based on the premise of a shared set of fundamental values.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What I mean to say is that only people who fully appreciate the utility value of this old quarry can comprehend its true worth.I’m not being overly fussy, I can assure you.” The insect dealer followed up my words swiftly in a gravelly voice.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“That’s right.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Just having this much space at your disposal is worth an incredible sum.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After all, Japan is a tiny country suffering from absolute space deficiency.”Was that big skull of his stuffed with bean curd instead of brains, or did he talk like an asshole on purpose?“Don’t get me wrong,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It’s not only the pillow I’m worried about.” There must have been something catching about the insect dealer’s rapid-fire, hoarse way of talking, for now the shill rattled on in the same way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“There are some pills I’ve been taking, and a book I’m halfway through—after all, we’ve got to get our things and move in, don’t we?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But I won’t come back empty-handed, Captain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Will you let me sell some of those passkeys for you?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll bring you back some absolutely first-rate people.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The kind that think fast and are flexible.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This cave has all sorts of possibilities, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Right off the top of my head I can think of farm-produce storage, lacquerware factories (they need plenty of moisture), mushroom cultivation, the brewing industry .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
you name it.”“Haven’t you got the message yet?” I said.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I don’t want people finding out about this place.”“I know.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What you’re really after is a way to work without paying taxes, am I right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Leave it to me, I’m an expert.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For instance, you could form a film studio to make porn videos.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They say that really rakes it in.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or you might consider running an underground hotel as a hideout for escaped criminals.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You wouldn’t have to spend much on facilities, and you could charge as much as you liked.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Even better would be intensive-care rooms for mental hospitals.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A mental hospital is really a kind of prison for lifers, so what with local citizens’ protests and one thing and another, finding somewhere to build can be a problem.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But once you have that, you’ve got the goose that lays the golden egg.Patients in lifetime isolation wards.”The man was totally uncomprehending.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But how could I explain the need for an ark to a cancer victim with only six months to live?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even if he had no inkling of his condition, persuading him would be a vain effort, one I could not bring myself to make.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Yet I couldn’t very well let him do as he pleased, either.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was saddled with one heck of a nuisance.Finally the trickle of water stopped, and the roar of the flushing toilet echoed in the air.“No need to make a special trip,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“The weather’s bad .. .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Go ahead and let me know if there’s anything you need, and I’ll do my best to get it or approximate it.”“Right, you can always make do for a pillow.” As if to say he had everything figured out, the insect dealer began drumming his fingers on the edge of the cup he had chosen, a look of sangfroid on his face.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Even if it’s borrowed, if you wrap it in a dirty undershirt of your own it comes to the same thing, doesn’t it?” 10THE SHILL DISAPPEARS AND ABOTTOM-SLAPPING RITUAL TAKES PLACEPerhaps because of having had to wait to go to the toilet, the shill descended the stairs in a sort of fox-trot, his knees pressed together.“I’m hungry,” murmured the insect dealer, eyes turned vaguely on the spot just vacated by the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“By the way, Captain,” he went on, “how do you manage to support yourself here?”I could well understand the motive of his question.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His was an entirely natural curiosity: the world over, a man’s source of income is the measure of his worth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even so, I had no obligation to reply, and no intention of doing so, either.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As a matter of fact, the electricity was all stolen, as were most of the fittings, which came from the city hall.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was no law that said I had to let him know my weakest points.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I pretended not to hear.Light footsteps approached, as those of the shill faded away; there remained less than ten seconds, I calculated, before she set foot on the top stair.“Maybe I shouldn’t have forced him to stay.”“Don’t worry about it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’re the captain.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Just follow your instincts.”“I heard he’s got cancer.”“No!”“She told me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Keep it quiet—he doesn’t know.”“Kind of ironic—the guy’s so much like a cancer himself.” We laughed loudly and freely in a burst of mutual understanding.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then the girl appeared, coffeepot in hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was unable to look her square in the face.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The echo of that gush, still fresh in my ears, made me picture not her face but the outlet for urine.She joined easily in our laughter, then announced gaily,“Guess what I found out!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The refrigerator’s stuffed full of canned beer!”“For shame,” scolded the insect dealer, pulling on the armrests of the chaise longue to bring his body forward.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You’re forgetting yourself, miss.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You can’t let yourself come that far under the president’s influence.”Intuitively I sensed he was referring to the shill.“President?” I queried.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Of what?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Who?”“You needn’t sound so impressed,” said the insect dealer.“These days everybody and his brother is a company president.The neighborhood junkman walks around with a namecard that says ‘President of Eastern Reclamation, Inc.’”“Still, what kind of a company is it?”The girl smiled, lips open and teeth closed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It’s called Saisai.”“What does that mean?”“It’s written with the characters for ‘hold’—as in a function or event—and ‘festival.’ ”“Peculiar sort of name.”“He represents festival stall owners.” The insect dealer waved his right hand as if flicking away imaginary dust, and adjusted his glasses with his left.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To the woman he said, “Anyway, don’t forget that without the captain’s permission you’re not entitled to a glass of water, let alone a can of beer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"First you go and put on some phony act about a fractured ankle, now this.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Try to show a little more sense.”His preachy tone of voice was far phonier than her act had been.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She nodded, and for no reason I found myself feeling abashed.“Don’t exaggerate,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“All I’ve been saying is there’s a need for caution about boarding procedures.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The beer doesn’t worry me.”A fat lot it didn’t.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I like to drink my beer all alone.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m a beer hog—a beeraholic, in fact, who breaks into a sweat at just the sound of the word.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What’s more, I like my beer with a little chocolate on the side.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Every day, once a day, I sip a leisurely can of beer and munch on chocolates.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It is a time of supreme piggish delight, a time I could share with no one.“You don’t mind, really?” Behind their thick concave lenses, the insect dealer’s questioning eyes widened in happy excitement.“Coffee before a meal is bad for the stomach, anyway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Shall we presume on the captain’s generosity this once?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Let’s celebrate our embarkation—that’s as good an excuse as any.” It was a sensation I’d often experienced in dreams—losing my footing on a hill of garbage.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In trying to recover lost ground, I made yet another concession.“Very well, let’s drink to that,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“But maybe beer alone isn’t enough.” I could hardly suggest chocolate as an accompaniment—although when you try it with an open mind, the hops and cacao blend together in a bitter harmony that I find irresistible.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“How about some canned sardines?”“Excellent,” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“They’re very good for you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sardines have lots of a nutrient called prostaglandin, which makes them effective against all kinds of diseases.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Hardening of the arteries, even cancer.”The idiot.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What did he have to go and say that for?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But then, I was the one who had spilled the beans to him, so what could I say?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Luckily, her expression didn’t flicker.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Turning toward the hold, she called down:“When you’re finished down there, we’re having beer and sardines up here.”Not to be outdone, I too called down.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“The sardines are in a basket on top of the refrigerator.”No answer.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I felt an unpleasant presentiment.She set the coffeepot on the table and smiled.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“So the coffee turned out to be a waste.”“No—I’ll have some,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Westerners drink coffee and alcohol together and think nothing of it, I’ve heard.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Somehow it protects the liver.”She poured out a cupful.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Still not a sound from the hold.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was time we heard something; since the point of emission is higher in the male than the female, the noise ought to be correspondingly louder.“Where’s the sugar?”“Let me think.” I take both tea and coffee without sugar, so I couldn’t recall immediately where I did keep it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had a feeling it might be in a jar in the back of the refrigerator, where ants wouldn’t get into it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It would probably be better to have the shill look for it while I gave instructions.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I went around the table, into the interstice where the bookcase and the parapet came together at a sharp angle, and looked down into the hold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The shill was nowhere to be seen.The meaning of the scene before my eyes temporarily eluded me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was a clean-cut oblong room, solid stone, with nowhere to hide and nowhere to search.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I felt the frustration of someone looking through the viewfinder of a broken stereoscope.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was used to seeing no one there, but how could I get used to not seeing someone who should be there?“Now where did he roam off to?” I muttered.The girl came around from the other side of the table and joined me at the parapet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Is he gone?” she asked.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She didn’t seem particularly concerned; in fact, she sounded rather intrigued.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Not knowing the lack of places to hide would doubtless take away the peculiarity of the situation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Coffee cup in hand, the insect dealer joined us.“Over there behind the storage drums, in the shadows,” he said, slurping his coffee, and called, “All right, let’s not be cute.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We all know you’re not so squeamish you can’t go right out in the open there.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Come on out.”“They’re lined up smack against the wall,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“There’s no way anybody could squeeze in there.”I realized what had happened.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I didn’t want to think about it, but I knew where the shill must have gone.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"From the bridge it was hard to see, but he must have crawled through the passageway cut into the far side of that same wall.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Unless he had chopped himself up and flushed himself down the toilet, there was simply no other exit.The girl called out, her voice trailing off in a long sinuous echo like the rise and fall of waves on a large, shallow strand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If you want to play hide-and-seek, wait till we decide who’s it.” I strained my ears, listening for a scream.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He could not possibly get through that passageway on his own.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I had set up a trap on the principle of the bow.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was triggered by a line of fishing gut stretched half an inch off the ground, which when touched would release a steel leaf spring.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The basic purpose was to keep rats out, but it could easily shatter a person’s ankle.“The bastard—he got away.” The insect dealer followed my line of vision and instantly grasped what had happened.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He leaned over the parapet, trying to peer down the passageway.“What’s down there, at the end of that tunnel?” Had these been the crew members I’d anticipated for so long, there would’ve been no need to ask.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That would have been the first place I’d have shown them: the heart of the ark, where tunnels branch off three ways, one to each of the other two holds, and one back here.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If each hold were a residential area, the“heart” was in the best location for communal use, so mentally I always referred to it as the “central hold” or “work hold.” It was my firm intention to interfere as little as possible in the crew’s personal lives, but some tasks, like the operation of air-purifying equipment or electric generators, required a joint effort.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The success or failure of life aboard the ark hinged on how well people cooperated.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If everyone lived like the eupcaccia, there would be no problem, since if no one had any urge to expand his or her territory, there would be no fear of mutual territorial violations.Letting the shill aboard might have been as fatal a lapse as if I had overlooked shipworms.“Machinery.” My voice sounded too belligerent.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"More graciously, I added, “I’ll take you there one of these times.”“What kind of machinery?”“Machinery for survival, of course.”“Survival of what?” asked the girl, at last seeming to grasp the situation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Bending her body at a right angle, she rested her weight on the parapet and leaned forward as far as she could.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Her skirt of artificial leather was stretched to the limit, revealing her round contours like a second skin.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The reality of those two soft globes right there beside my own hips seemed more fanciful than my wildest fancies.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My brain began to turn red and raw, as if peeling.“Survival of what?” she repeated.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What indeed, I wondered.If only she had asked not “of what,” but “why.” For if it was possible for me to go on living near a skirt stretched this tightly, over this round a pair of hips, then I had no doubts whatever concerning the meaning of survival.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Even the eupcaccia emerged from its chrysalis in preparation for mating.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Emergence is a preparation for rebirth—regeneration—as well as for death.Looking sideways at her round, tight skirt, I thought that perhaps I too was starting to emerge from my cocoon.“Of course survival for its own sake is meaningless.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s pointless to live a life not worth living.” My answer was no answer.The insect dealer then spoke up in my place.“Don’t you ever think about nuclear war or things like that?” he asked her.“It doesn’t interest me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even on TV, if it’s anything about war I change the channel.”“That’s a woman for you,” said the insect dealer, turning his back to the hold and settling against the parapet until he was at the optimal distance for viewing her hips (about ten inches away).“Women are born without any imagination.”Hardly a sensitive remark.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Instinctively I came to her defense.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Look who’s talking.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You can’t stand barking dogs, can you?”“No, but so what?”The girl purposely made light of it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“The reason women don’t think ahead is because they have to go to the supermarket every day.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This coffee is too bitter for me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I don’t like it without sugar.”“No?” I said.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“But it’s better this way if we’re going to have beer next, isn’t it?”The insect dealer gulped the remainder of his coffee with a noise like the pump of a dry well, never ceasing his close observation of her rump.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Seemingly conscious of his eyes, she waved her hand now and then as if to chase off a pesky fly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But her right-angled posture remained the same, needlessly provocative.“Let’s go downstairs and see what we can see,” I said, motioning to her, my real aim being to get her away from the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If he’s injured, it’ll mean trouble.”“I wouldn’t worry,” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“That man is as sharp as they come.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He can catch flies in his bare hands.”“So can I.”“While they’re flying.”“I wouldn’t be too sure about him,” said the insect dealer.He laughed sharply and gave the woman’s bottom a slap, making a startlingly loud noise.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In monkey colonies, what did they call it?Oh, yes—mounting: the losing monkey sticks out its rear end.Subjugation begins with control of the other’s hindquarters.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s already dead.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I don’t know what sort of trap it was, but if he’d only hurt himself a little, he’d be screaming for help by now.”Despite the liberty the insect dealer took with her bottom, the girl reacted only by twisting away and jerking her head.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Had she fallen so easily under his sway?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or was she used to this sort of thing?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perhaps it was not as serious as I’d assumed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I wanted to follow his example, but something held me back.“I doubt if his life could be in danger,” I said, “but it is pitch dark in there.”“He took a light,” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Remember that one hanging from the locker handle—the kind coal miners wear on their heads.”His statements lacked consistency.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"First he exaggerated the danger the shill was in, then in the next breath he emphasized how safe he was.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He was just out to find fault with whatever I said.She sided with him.“That’s right, it’s a waste of time worrying about him—he’s sharp as a tack,” she said, and casually shifted her weight from the left leg to the right; in the process the two globes, still pressed close together, subtly changed shape.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The skirt stuck to her bottom, becoming progressively more transparent.I wasn’t seriously concerned about the shill’s well-being myself; I only wanted to put a fast stop to this unpleasant collusion between the insect dealer and her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, it was barely possible that he had gotten safely past the trap and entered the work hold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was unwilling to credit him with as much cunning and dexterity as she, but perhaps something—a rat, say—had tripped the mechanism beforehand.I could not have people roaming all over the ship, in any case.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The air-conditioning system and electrical generator were as yet unfinished, and I couldn’t permit anyone to lay hands on them in my absence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I especially did not want him, or anyone, getting into the magazine, where locked in a safe I had five crossbows, seven model guns, and one rifle rebuilt with steel-reinforced barrel and hammer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I had test-fired each one five successive times with no difficulty.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was damned if I’d let the shill get his hands on those.With the ark in danger of springing a leak, this was no time to loiter.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was essential to go straight below and take defensive steps.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But the other two seemed content to stay where they were.After the insect dealer’s ritual assertion of supremacy just now, I could not bring myself to go off and entrust the girl to his keeping.The situation called for deportment worthy of a captain, to make them recognize my leadership.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What if I went ahead and gave her bottom a resounding slap myself ?“Anyway, let’s get going,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Taking advantage of the opportunity my words provided, I gave the girl’s bottom a slap that was bold in spirit, if less so in reality.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The sound effect was poor, but the tactile impression was richly rewarding—the moist, clingy feel of artificial leather, and a heavy warmth that sank deep into my flesh.The girl straightened up and turned red.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She opened her eyes wide and looked straight at me, whether in fear or embarrassment I could not tell.“I didn’t know you had it in you,” said the insect dealer, licking his lips, and reaching past the girl to slap my shoulder.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He flashed me a secretive, friendly grin in which I could detect no trace of irony or ridicule.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Had it been a success?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer walked ahead, leading the way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Reality returned.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was as if at last the ship’s rudder had begun to work.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The day’s events had not been a total waste.11AT FIRST GLANCE THE PASSAGEWAYAPPEARS TO BE A MERE CRACKOR SLIT IN THE SEAM BETWEEN WALLSAt first glance the passageway appears to be a mere crack or slit rising high in the seam between walls.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This is because of its enormous height, over fifty feet in all; actually it is wide enough for a small truck to pass through easily.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We were dwarfed as we drew near.About fifteen feet in, it turned to the right, thus blocking off our light source from the first hold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As we moved on in darkness, the floor began rising.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Calling a warning to the others, I halted and stared ahead into the blackness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If the shill was there, the light from his lamp should be visible.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Those shadows, light and dark, that moved with my eyeballs—were they mere afterimages, within the eye?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I could see nothing else.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Had he switched off his lantern, hearing our footsteps?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Why?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I pushed the second button on the switch control panel hanging from my belt, and fluorescent lights spaced evenly along the walls came sputtering to life.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The right-hand wall of the passageway continued on to become the south wall of the work hold.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The first hold and the central work hold were linked directly by this passage.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The cluster of white pipes along the west wall, like a scale-model factory, was a manually operated air-conditioning system.“Looks like he found the switch,” the insect dealer whispered in my ear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He hadn’t caught on that I was operating a remote-control switch.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I saw no reason to relieve him of his misapprehension.The girl took a step forward and called, cupping her hands,“Come on out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Hide-and-seek’s over.”“Watch out.” I grabbed her arm and pulled her back.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Why, I wondered, was her skin so soft?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For a while I let my fingers stay as they were, pressed into her flesh.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was the first such change in mental state I had undergone since the bottom-slapping incident.He who controls the woman controls the group.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Leering in my imagination like a movie villain, I strained my eyes to see the stone floor a few steps ahead.The worst situation possible met my gaze.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The flat steel spring lay blocking our way like a railway crossing gate.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"By rights it should have been fastened to the wall, set so that the moment anything or anyone touched the silkworm gut, suspended in a zigzag just off the floor, the latch would release and the spring would mow down its prey.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Someone (possibly the shill) had either seen through the device and dismantled it safely, or else fallen into the trap.“Is that a trap?” She clung to my arm.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A most favorable sign.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The sound of urinating .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
bottom slapping .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
and now direct contact.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At the same time, I found myself still more apprehensive: a sprung trap, and no sign of prey.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".“Yes,” I responded, “but the spring’s been released.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Look, the strings on the floor have all gone slack.”“I’ll be damned.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’re right.” The insect dealer crouched over the steel spring and removed his glasses.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“These lenses aren’t right for my eyes—but wait a minute, where’s the victim?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If this came down on your leg, you’d sure as hell know it.”“That’s right; we didn’t hear a scream,” said the girl.“It didn’t have to be a person, you know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A rat could have set it off easily,” I said.“Yes, but a rat would get killed, wouldn’t it?” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Not only is there no dead rat here; the spring is perfectly clean.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There’s not even any hair on it, let alone bloodstains.”“Then it was a person.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Somebody stood back at a safe distance and poked it with the end of a stick, or threw a stone at the string.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But to do that you’d have to know before-hand that the trap existed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So it’s impossible.”“It’s possible,” the girl said flatly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“He’s a master at anticipating people’s moves.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Cards, mah-jongg .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"you name it.”“Yes, and he’s already been hurt, twice.” The insect dealer put his hands on the small of his back and stretched.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“First the staircase, then the fireworks.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But, Captain, it doesn’t necessarily have to be the president, does it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Couldn’t it be somebody else, like a spy who sneaked aboard when you weren’t looking?” There was no point in discussing hypothetical possibilities.The important thing now was to ascertain the shill’s whereabouts.“Whoever it was, he couldn’t have just melted away.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’s no snowman,” I said, stepping over the steel spring and moving forward.“He’s terrible, running off like this without a word to anyone,” the girl responded fretfully.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The genuine irritation in her voice seemed to rule out any possibility of collusion.We entered the work hold.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was the same size as the first hold but seemed smaller, as the length and breadth were equal.The ceiling, however, was high, so glancing up, one had an impression of spaciousness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The pillar thrusting upward directly ahead, near the back wall—or in other words along what was an extension of the right wall of this passageway—was exactly twenty-three feet around.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The number of pillars, and their girth, were apparently fixed according to ceiling height.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Behind the pillar was a tunnel over three feet across and six and a half feet high, easily overlooked because of the old bicycles piled up nearby as camouflage.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There were twenty-eight of them, which I planned someday to turn into a foot-powered electric generator.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Catty-corner from the pillar—or from where we were, at the far end of the near left-hand wall—gaped the opening of a second passageway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Rusted rails indicated that this had been a main tunnel when the quarry was still in operation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A third opening was near the ceiling, straight ahead on the left, below which a lift—a sort of vertical conveyor belt—was attached.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Excavation work customarily proceeds from high to low, so probably in the beginning this was used to transport excavated stone to the surface.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When it became apparent that the layer of high-quality rock extended deeper than was anticipated, they must have dug out the main passageway, to raise efficiency.“What a mountain of rock!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Whoever made off with all this must have earned themselves a pile of dough.” As he said this, the insect dealer swung his big head around as if his neck had no vertebrae.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“So where do you think our friend went?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Where would you look, Captain?”The lift was over forty feet high—a bit much even for a former Self-Defense Forces member.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The secret passage in the shadow of the pillar looked like nothing more than a scrap heap.Our eyes turned as if by agreement to the large tunnel entrance on the left, where the end of the rails could be seen.“Come on out, will you!” shouted the girl, the echo extending her voice.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You’ve made enough trouble.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just when we were going to eat, too.”“Remember, he polished off eight of those kamaboko sticks all by himself.” The insect dealer lifted his undershirt and began rubbing dirt off the skin on his side.“Anyway, let’s have a look.” I led the way down the tunnel.Their footsteps behind me rang out with appalling loudness.“What’s this jiggledy-joggledy thing?” asked the girl, regarding a seesaw-style pump fastened to the wall along the way.“It’s a pump hooked up to the ventilation system.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s set up so that two people working it by hand for four hours a day can purify the air of three holds.”“You’ve got it all worked out, haven’t you?” The insect dealer wiped his finger on his trousers, and laid a hand on the seat of the upper arm of the seesaw.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The pump functioned smoothly, operating on the resistance of air inside six-inch-diameter stainless-steel pipes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Not bad,” he said admiringly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Pretty darned clever, in fact.”“Why doesn’t it run on electricity?” the girl cut in with a dissatisfied air.“When the time comes to use the system, there’ll be no electricity,” I told her.“Don’t waste your time explaining,” said the insect dealer.“You can’t talk logic to a woman.” He raised his right arm, bent at the elbow, and hauled back, aiming for the girl’s rear end.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She dodged nimbly aside.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Kicking the pedal of one of three wheelless bicycles lined up beside the pump, she said boastfully:“I know what these are.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They look like exercise machines, but really they’re generators.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Right?”“Yes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They’re hooked up to car generators.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Of course they function as exercise equipment too; lack of exercise is a perennial problem.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“One of these would supply about enough electricity for one twelve-watt bulb, and that’s it,” said the insect dealer, and launched a second attack on her backside.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was the sound of a wet towel falling on the floor.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’d scored a direct hit, in the area of the crease in her buttocks.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She emitted a scream that was half wail.“Eventually I intend to convert all those old bikes in that pile over there.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With twenty-eight bikes operating at the same time, charging up the car batteries, there would be enough energy to supply an average day’s needs.”Pretending I was going to activate one to show them, I drew closer to the woman and laid a hand on her myself, not to be outdone.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was not so much a slap as a caress: that prolonged the contact by a good five times.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Using her hand on the handlebars as a fulcrum, she swung herself around to the other side, bent forward, and giggled.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On the other side, the insect dealer was waiting, palm outstretched.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was a game of handball, her bottom the ball.“In that case, you have to have a fairly large crew.” He served.“Not all men, I sincerely hope,” she said, reentering my court.“Of course not; there’ll be lots and lots of women too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".” Bold now, I took my turn, giving her bottom a good pinch into the bargain.“That’s enough.” She squatted down, hands covering her posterior.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If the captain and I got on the same seesaw, it would stop moving, wouldn’t it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Please don’t get me wrong.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.” I couldn’t completely fathom what she meant.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And yet suddenly my excitement ebbed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She had referred to what bothered me most—the difference in our weights.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The insect dealer too seemed to return to himself.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Licking the palm of his serving hand with his long tongue, he sighed and glanced up at the ceiling.“Say,” he said, “isn’t this a terrible waste, all this electricity?”How like him—a totally practical view.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This hold alone had ninety-six fluorescent lights, plus five halogen lights of five hundred watts each.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not only were the ceilings high, but the blue stone walls were dulled by nicks and scratches from the electric saws, reflecting the available light so poorly that in order for the hold to function as a center of operations, extra intensities of illumination were necessary.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If an electric bill came, I could never hope to pay it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But it was too soon to show my hand.There was a sound of water dripping.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The girl started up and exclaimed, “What was that?”Allowing for some variation according to the weather and the time of day, at intervals of once every thirty minutes to three hours a barrage of water drops fell from the ceiling in the first hold onto the row of storage drums.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They made a dry, unwatery noise that sounded as if a chair had overturned, or the bottom had burst in a bag of beans.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Since it’s impossible to tell what direction the sound is coming from, the imagination swells limitlessly.Without explaining, I turned and headed straight down the second tunnel entrance.The lights of the operation hold illuminated the rusty rails for another twenty-five feet or so.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The lights all shone straight down, so the sheer walls at either side vanished halfway up into darkness, as if stretching all the way to heaven.“Got some kind of a trap in here too?” asked the insect dealer in an undertone.“Of course.”“I’m telling you, he really is very agile.” She too spoke in an undertone.“This next one is different.” Holding my arms out at shoulder level, I took three steps forward into the dark, guided by the rails, and then slowly I lowered my arms.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
An alarm bell rang out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shadow of the insect dealer, which had been following close behind me, suddenly disappeared; he’d tripped on a tie and fallen, crashing into the girl, who let out a scream.“Quick, turn that damn thing off—it’s bad for my heart.” Seated where he had fallen, the insect dealer covered both ears with his hands.The left side of the seventh tie from the front.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I groped for the switch under the rail, found it, and gave it a flip.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The ringing stopped, leaving only a buzz in the ears.“See what I mean?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This one is foolproof.”“Says who?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s the same kind of thing they install in banks, right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A burglar alarm using infrared lights.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you look carefully, you can see a red beam in the air, and all you have to do is duck under it.”“Wouldn’t work.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There are three different beams, which get lower as you go.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The lowest one is only a foot off the ground.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"How the hell could anyone duck under that?”“Where does this lead to?” The girl was crouched down, with a hand cupped behind one ear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I hear something.”“It’s a dead end.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It used to connect over to the western side of the mountain, just under where the city hall is now, but there was a cave-in, and it became a blind alley.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But there are lots of little rooms along the way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It might make a good place to live.”“There’s a town on top of this mountain, isn’t there?”“Yes, a big residential district.”“I hear noises.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”“It’s not what you think.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Inaudible sounds become audible here, amplified as they bounce off the ceilings and walls: winds of different velocities passing by each other, bugs crawling around, drops of water falling, stone cracking.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“I don’t care, I’m not going up there.” The insect dealer looked up at the tunnel at the ceiling edge, brushing stone powder off the seat of his pants.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Granted the guy’s reckless and athletic—but doesn’t it seem funny that these lights came on just twenty or thirty seconds before we came in here?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In fact, all we did was check out the trap, so maybe it wasn’t even that long.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That contraption would be hard to climb, and it must be a good twenty-five feet high.”“Forty-two, to be exact.”“No way.”“Then where do you think he is?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There’s nowhere to hide.” The girl thrust out her chin, tilted her head back like radar, and turned around in a full circle.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“What’s that smell?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s stronger than it was before.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And it’s definitely not fried squid.”“I smell it too.” The insect dealer likewise tilted his head back and sniffed the air.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I’ve smelled it somewhere before.”“It’s the smell of the wind,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It blows down through that hole in the ceiling.”“That doesn’t lead to a Chinese restaurant, does it?” she asked.“Don’t be ridiculous.” I had my own explanation for the odor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But I was not duty-bound to tell them, nor did I think it was at all necessary.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Even fifteen seconds is longer than you think.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A woman can do the hundred-yard dash in that length of time.” The girl started walking straight toward the lift.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"From around her feet, shadows stretched out in all directions, light and dark, like the spokes of a fan.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She put both hands on the bottom of the scaffolding and hung from it, suspending her full weight.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It’s perfectly strong,” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Somebody climb up.”“Forty-two feet in the air?”“Well, you had training for a rescue squad, didn’t you?”“After I left them, I got acrophobia.” The insect dealer spoke glumly, lifting his shirt and scratching his belly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Captain, how about leveling with us?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Is there some reason you don’t want him wandering around in here?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Something you don’t want him to find out?”“No, nothing in particular.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s just that it turns into a real maze; I haven’t finished surveying it yet.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Once I made it all the way to the tangerine grove on the other side of the mountain.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I carried a lunch, and it took nearly all day.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The inside of the mountain’s full of other, smaller mountains, and valleys, and rivers.”“Yeah?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Any fish?” asked the insect dealer, his forehead wrinkling—a sign of serious interest.“Not a chance.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The only living creatures in there are snakes and beetles and centipedes.”“Then he won’t make it,” said the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“He’s terrified of snakes.” She looked at me and the insect dealer in turn.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was she worried about the shill’s safety after all?“A bigger problem would be finding the way back,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I had a heck of a time, believe me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It took me all morning just to get over to the other side, and then coming back I tried to follow the same route and got lost.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A compass isn’t worth a damn underground.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The going was dangerous and I was hungry, and so tired my knees were knocking.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Before I knew it, it was the middle of the night.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Frankly, I thought I was done for.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You know, like those stories you hear about people who wandered in the wind holes under Mount Fuji and died there without ever finding their way out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“So what happened?”“So there I was, camping out with nothing but a bar of chocolate and what little water came seeping out of the rocks, no sleeping bag—not even a flashlight, since the batteries had given out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I never felt so forlorn in my whole life.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But when the sun came up—”“How could you tell the sun came up?”“That’s it, you wouldn’t believe it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’d retraced my steps back to the other side of the mountain—the north entrance, I call it, or the tangerine grove entrance—and spent the whole night there.When I woke up, the morning light was pouring in.”“That is unbelievable.” The girl’s tone was stinging, but her eyes emanated sympathy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“People’s instincts don’t amount to much, do they?”“In the dark, your senses are numbed.”“So,” said the insect dealer, stretching and narrowing his eyes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You’re saying he’s the only one who’ll suffer; you have nothing in particular to lose if he’s in there.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Right?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then who cares—let him go.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Let it teach him a lesson.”“You have a point there,” said the girl, falling in easily with his opinion.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For some reason, this sudden switchover seemed entirely natural.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It’s just silly to waste time worrying about him.Last December, when we were at a fair near a ski slope, a truck came sliding down a steep hill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It must have been doing at least forty miles an hour.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Right then he was crossing the street, and he slipped and fell in the truck’s path.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What do you think happened?After the truck rolled on by, he got up and walked away, not a scratch on him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’s invulnerable.”“He is, huh?” I said, thinking, Another six months and he’ll be a goner.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I started to say the words but caught myself in time.She didn’t react.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Didn’t it seem ironic to her that a man with only six months to live should have such great reflexes that he was“invulnerable”?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was the only one who felt abashed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Inwardly I tendered an apology to the shill.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Heroes fated to die untimely deaths have an inescapable air of privilege.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I began to think it was high time to drop my unwarranted hostility toward the guy and issue him a special complimentary boarding pass.The insect dealer gave his belly a couple of resounding slaps.“Let’s eat.”The girl glanced up at the top of the lift.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It still seemed to weigh on her.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Never mind if it was a stunt worthy of an acrobat—there did remain the small possibility that he had somehow clambered up to the ceiling.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I, however, was more concerned about the shadow behind that far right pillar.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Before we ate, I wanted to make sure he wasn’t lurking in there.“This is a long shot, but I just want to be sure.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Behind those old bikes over there, there’s a small storage space with a trapdoor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This’ll only take a minute.”The twenty-eight old bicycles piled in a triangular heap between the stone pillar and the wall were a tangled mass of handlebars and wheels that formed an ingenious barrier: not only did they make entry difficult; they kept one from suspecting anything was there.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It looked as if nothing but wall was behind them.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Light was particularly dim, as if the overseer (me) set no great store by the area.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But it was all a trick.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Of all the shipboard traps, this one was the most elaborately camouflaged: the entire triangle formed by these tangled old bikes was in fact a door.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The“key” was the front wheel on the far right bike.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All you had to do was twist the handlebars sharply and pull out the pedal that was embedded in the spokes of the neighboring bike.“Now it’s unlocked.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Mind aligning the wheels of the bikes in the front row?”A slight pull, and the triangle of all twenty-eight bikes swung around to reveal, alongside the pillar, a gaping wedge-shaped passageway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At the far end lay a section of dirty canvas, roughly six feet by three.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the dim light it looked like something to throw over the bikes, but it was in fact camouflage for a trapdoor, backed with plywood and fastened with hinges.“Isn’t there some kind of bug that makes a nest like this, covering it over with leaves?” asked the girl.“I think you mean a fish.”“No, a bug.”The construction inside was worthy of the camouflage outside.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just beyond the door was a small room with a low ceiling, just over six and a half feet high.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Tunnels had been dug out in three levels—top, middle, and bottom—each leading to yet another small room, all interconnected by irregular narrow stone steps.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was rather as if several playground monsters, the kind whose labyrinthine innards children love to climb around in, had been lined up and joined together.“This is just a guess,” I said, “but I suspect these were all trial borings.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They tried digging in different directions, but the quality of the stone here fell short of their expectations, and so they gave up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All these tunnels are small, and the excavation is rough.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But they’re handy for storing materials according to type.” A largish, high-ceilinged room at the top of the right-hand stairs was where I kept food supplies, sorted by kind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Thirty dozen cans of hardtack.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Seventeen cartons packed with eleven-pound vacuum-packed bags of uncooked rice.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Two hundred meals’worth of dried noodles.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Assorted dried vegetables.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Miso, soy sauce, salt, sugar.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Five big cartons of canned foods, including stewed beef, tuna, sardines, and so on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was also a complete kit for cultivating vegetables by hydroponics, and an assortment of seeds.On the middle level was a cubbyhole with a complex jumble of irregular undulations, less like a room than a model for a fallen castle.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I kept all sorts of supplies there, from hardware to everyday items like razors, soap, toothpaste, as well as medicine, bandages, and other first-aid supplies.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There were also rechargeable batteries, light bulbs, solid alcohol for fuel, film, a whetstone, solder and soldering iron, adhesive, assorted fishing line, fire extinguishers .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If I didn’t get busy and make a list of everything, I was in danger of losing track of it all myself.The lowest level was the most comfortable.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This was not mere storage space but a real room, with seven chairs, a table, a slide projector, and a screen.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The front wall, moreover, was hung with a large rough sketch of the quarry, which I had made two weeks before—too soon to include the results of my latest survey.Still, as a three-color ground plan, it wasn’t too bad.On the adjacent wall were twenty-eight gas-and-smoke masks; wrench, hammer, crowbar, and other tools that could double as weapons; thirty-five twelve-volt batteries.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Along the opposite wall were seven small automatic guns—remodeled toys—along with empty cartridges and boxes of ammunition, raw materials for gunpowder, five crossbows and one hundred and two arrows.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In addition, there was a box of sand marked, in large letters, SAND FOR FIRE EXTINGUISHING.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Inside the sand there were forty-three leftover sticks of dynamite, which I intended to leave hidden right there for the time being.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All I had to do was plant a flag next to the map, and the room would look exactly like one of those underground strategic command headquarters you see in the movies.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What sort of flag would look best—the Rising Sun?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I have a feeling that’s not it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve never given the matter deep thought, but somehow I have a feeling no flag would look quite right.“He doesn’t seem to be anywhere in here.” The girl stood in front of the map, studying it with her head tilted sharply sideways, as if she couldn’t tell which way was up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Although it’s not surprising, with that entrance.”“You’re well prepared, I’ll grant you that.” The insect dealer ran a finger over the tabletop, then rubbed the accumulated dust on his trousers, twisting his lower lip as he spoke.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Still, isn’t there something a little childish about your taste in furnishings?” Evidently a reference to the model guns.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Did he really think they were there just for decoration?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then let him go on thinking so.“Supposing he went down the ceiling tunnel,” said the girl, her head still sideways as she traced the surface of the map with a finger.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“That’s this black line, right?”“All the parts I explored myself are in black.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The red lines are hypothetical, based on a map done by the quarry companies, on file in the city hall.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Strange, don’t you think?—they overlap, but there are no actual points of congruence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Probably because everybody ignored the agreement, and went off digging on their own.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Small wonder the roof caved in.”“And the blue lines?”“The solid ones are canals and waterways, the dotted ones are underground veins of water.”“By the time you need firearms, it’s always too late.” The insect dealer picked up a crossbow and aimed it at the map.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Those black lines go off the bounds of the map.”“I’ll add on the rest as the need arises.”“I’ll bet he’s left the bounds of the map too,” said the insect dealer.The girl turned around and shrieked, “Stop that!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s dangerous!”“No, it isn’t—it’s not loaded.” As he spoke, the insect dealer pointed the weapon directly at her face.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“But it feels awful, doesn’t it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even when you know it’s a joke, it still does.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There’s just something about firearms I don’t like.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They never settle anything, anyway.”“Quit preaching; it doesn’t suit you,” I said, adding, “Look, they’re only model guns.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And the crossbows are for rodent control.”The girl came around the table, reached out an arm, and flicked the bowstring.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Can you really shoot rats with one of these?” she asked.“Sure.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you hit one square, you could knock it dead.” The insect dealer held the bow down with his foot, and slipped the bowstring in place.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Deftly he fitted in an aluminum arrow and set up the sight, adjusting for distance before handing it to her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Go ahead and try it,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“When you look through the hole, the target should be sitting on top of the sight.”“I don’t know why, but it scares me a little.”“There’s nothing to it, because it has no kick, unlike gunpowder.” He set an empty cigarette carton lengthwise on the back of a chair some thirteen feet off.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Here’s your target.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Don’t make any conscious effort to keep your arm steady.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just relax, take a breath, and hold it.”There was the snap of the string being released, and—beginner’s luck, of course—a bull’s-eye.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The cigarette carton was in pieces, and the arrow, having shot clean through it, ricocheted back off a wall.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She twisted and whooped in triumph.“Wow, I hit it!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Is it okay if I borrow this for a while?”“Sure,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Those are legal.” My feelings were mixed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In line with the insect dealer’s opinion, my prize stockpile of weapons was beginning to seem terribly juvenile.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Hunting is forbidden, but you can use them for fishing.”“Where can you fish?” She was holding up the crossbow and aiming through the sight this way and that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Feels a little heavy.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But it seems to have a lot more power than an airgun.”“The only trouble is, it’s not suited for live combat,” said the insect dealer; unhesitatingly he selected an Uzi sub-machine gun from the gun rack, and gave its barrel a few meaningful pats.“Loading it takes too much time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you’re conducting a preemptive strike, with plenty of time to aim so your first shot scores, well and good; but in combat, you’d probably be better off with a slingshot.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A crossbow is capable of inflicting a mortal wound only if fired at a range of one hundred feet or less, so if your first shot misses you have to fall back on your fists.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This Uzi, now, is another story.”“You seem to know enough about it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Where did you learn all that?” I asked.“I wasn’t in the Self-Defense Forces for nothing.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But, Captain, aren’t you the one who knows a hell of a lot?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Your average person wouldn’t think of an Uzi.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s not used by regulars so much as it is by commandos.”“Come on, it’s only a toy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"While I was watching the news about the Reagan assassination attempt, I noticed the Secret Service men were all using them.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I liked the small size and the design, that’s all.”“Sorry, I don’t buy it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This has been converted into a real gun.” He scraped the rust off the cocking bolt, sniffed the muzzle, and peered at the breechblock, then stuck in a finger and explored the interior.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“And I’ll be damned if it hasn’t been test-fired.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Some guts.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No cracks or other damage, so it must have been a success, too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What is it?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Single-loading?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Semiauto?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Don’t tell me it’s an automatic.”“Pull out the magazine and have a look.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Toy bullets.”“Give up,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“So you stuck in a couple of blanks for camouflage, and for warning shots.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Very smart.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But I have news for you—back in your cabin, around that machine, there were metal shavings on the floor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Right?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As I said, I didn’t sign up for the SDF for nothing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I always liked guns.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I knew right away what you’d been up to.”Further protest seemed futile.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The third shot, and all the rest, were in fact real cartridges, albeit homemade.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You know your way around guns, all right,” I commented.“Want me to check them out for you?”I was tempted to take him up on the offer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had test-fired each one five times with no problems, but I was still uncertain as to how they might hold up in a shoot-out.“You don’t think much of my arsenal, though, do you?”“I’m only saying it won’t serve the purpose.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s certainly interesting.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This looks like some special steel, though; about all you can do is reinforce it and make up the difference by adjusting the amount of gunpowder.”“I can’t do it!” the girl cried.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She was sitting on a forty-four-pound keg of active carbon, both feet braced on the crossbow, unable to fit the bowstring into place.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Not enough strength in my back, I guess.”“I don’t think you can do it bare-handed,” I said.“Afterwards I’ll lend you my leather driving gloves.” I fixed it for her, and grabbing five arrows, she ran up the tunnel stairs.“Look at her go.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You can’t stop her.”“She’s charming.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Makes me feel like getting out my camera for the first time in a long while.”“Weapons have a way of changing people.”The insect dealer pulled the trigger on the Uzi, replaced the cocking lever, and held the weapon in his arms.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Captain,” he said, “are you sure you aren’t a misanthrope at heart?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’re too exclusivist.”Suddenly there was a shout from the work hold.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was the girl.“Come on out or I’ll shoot!” Perhaps because the high tones were absorbed by the moist, uneven surface of the stone walls, her voice sounded lower than usual; that in turn might have explained the note of urgency in her voice, which seemed to preclude the possibility of a joke.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was a muffled response.The insect dealer and I raced neck and neck up the stairs.We arrived on the scene just as she was relaxing and lowering the crossbow from her shoulder.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The shill was climbing down from the hole in the ceiling.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He appeared nimble and surefooted.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He turned his head and looked at us with a provocative smile.12EVERYBODY’S GOT A FEWSCARS ON THE SHINWe all knew this was not a propitious moment for sounding one another out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Round one, a time of mutual sizing up, was over, and now we were about to enter on the decisive round two.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The important thing now was to control your breathing, and try to anticipate the others’ moves.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Everyone seemed to feel the same way; and so until the beer was opened we observed a careful truce, keeping the sensitive matter of the shill’s expedition firmly off limits.Supper was instant Chinese noodles topped with chopped green onion, a couple of ham slices, and an egg.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To go with the beer, I opened, as promised, a can of sardines.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I could have come up with a fancier menu if I’d wanted, but it didn’t seem necessary.Besides the noodles, we lugged five cans of beer per person up to the bridge.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I sat in the chair by the stairs, the insect dealer sat on the parapet, and the shill and the girl sat at either end of the chaise longue; this had the drawback of being so low that their chins barely reached the tabletop, but it had the compensating advantage of greater comfort.The insect dealer downed his first beer in one gulp.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill, having taken charge of the crate of beer, promptly tossed him another, over the table, and then picked up the loaded crossbow from the girl’s feet.“Komono,” he said, “mind setting your empty can over there?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I want to try a little target practice.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Let’s see, now, where’s the safety catch on this?”The girl put her chin on the shill’s shoulder and removed the pin at the base of the trigger for him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even assuming there was something between them, her manner was far too intimate for so public a setting.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was she a born flirt, or just an innocent?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Dogs that fawn on everyone appeal only to children.“Knock it off, you two.” Even as he set up the can on one end of the parapet in compliance with the shill’s request, the insect dealer spoke in a disgusted tone of voice.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Hurry up and eat, or your noodles will get cold.”The shill pulled the trigger.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The can appeared to sway slightly, but he had missed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
In the distance we heard the arrow ricochet.“Some marksman!” The girl laughed and stole a glance at me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Why, I could hit a pack of cigarettes straight on, bang.” The shill buried his face in the large bowl of noodles, slurped up a mouthful, and then muttered, mouth full, “Rats!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If only I’d had something like this before, I’d never have let that little bastard get away.”“What was it, a rat?” asked the girl innocently.“We’ve made our toasts,” said the shill, “so shall we move on to the business at hand?” He wiped his mouth and stared straight at me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
End of truce.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Let’s have it, Captain—who the hell was that guy?”In my stomach, the beer and noodles formed a lump of sticky tar.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What had he seen?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What was he trying to say?“What do you mean, who?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There isn’t anybody else.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"How could there be?”“Don’t try to play games with me.”“You must have imagined it.”“Hold on a minute, please,” said the insect dealer, and washed down a mouthful of sardines with a swig of beer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“As the captain’s adviser, naturally I’m on his side—but in any case, I think we’d better get the facts straight.” He turned to the shill and said, “Now, Mr. President, tell me the truth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You had on that miner’s light before you even left here; are you sure you weren’t planning on doing a little exploring all along?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If people think you’re bullshitting them about having seen some suspicious character, how can you blame them?”“Very observant, Komono—I’ve got to hand it to you.” The shill opened a second can of beer and flashed a friendly smile.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“All right, it’s true that I thought I’d take a little walk after I finished using the john.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But that doesn’t make me crazy enough to go so far for no reason.”“I’m still suspicious.” The girl raised her head from the bowl, a noodle trailing down from her mouth; she sucked it in with almost invisible speed and went on: “Then why didn’t you call for help?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you trusted the captain, that’s what you should have done.”“You keep out of it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And I don’t trust the captain.” He thrust out his arm in my direction and snapped his fingers with conviction.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The thought crossed my mind that his story might possibly be true.“What kind of a guy was he, then?” I asked.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“When you first laid eyes on him, where was he and what was he doing?”“Then you admit he exists,” he said arrogantly, kicking the floor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Who is he?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Why are you hiding him?”“I’m not hiding anyone!”“You asked me what he was like, didn’t you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That shows you know something.”“Don’t get so excited.” The insect dealer reached across the table and took his third beer from the girl.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Purple spots were starting to show on his forehead and cheeks; he probably had low resistance to alcohol.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“What we need now is a lie detector.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But think about it; even if you have an obligation to tell the truth, the captain here doesn’t.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You two were never invited on board, after all—you’re a couple of crashers.”“The hell you say.” He sprayed us with saliva.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I thought I made it clear—I can’t sleep without my pillow.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He’s the one who’s forcing me to stay against my will.”“That’s a bit strong.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Don’t forget, legally he’s not a certified ship’s captain.” The insect dealer tapped the area above his stomach and emitted a loud belch.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“In other words, he can call himself captain all he likes, but without the consent of the crew, it doesn’t mean a thing.”“In that case, we settle it by force—”“Or by an election.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I don’t approve of violence.”“I know!” The girl’s voice was bright, as if she’d made a great discovery.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“All he has to do is pay us a salary.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"People always follow the orders of whoever’s paying their wages.”“You may be onto something there,” said the insect dealer slowly, staring at her as if appraising collateral.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The captain may be well off, at that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He’s poured a lot of money into fixing up this place.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But his photography business doesn’t amount to anything, and he doesn’t seem to have any other means of employment .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".so who knows, maybe he’s a man of independent means, who made his fortune by selling off some piece of land or other.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Maybe that fishermen’s inn outside under the highway was really registered in his name.”“Aha.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If that’s true, that changes everything.” The shill sank back in the chaise longue, setting down the crossbow and lowering his eyes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Then we naturally have certain obligations to fulfill, and the captain has certain rights.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Maybe I misunderstood the whole situation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How could I help it?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Back at the department store rooftop you made it seem as if the ticket and key were for sale.”“That’s right,” the girl said, nodding.“But you two didn’t pay!” The insect dealer shook his big round head slowly, with a triumphant smile.“Did he?” Suspicious, the girl turned to me.He answered her question himself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I’ll say I did—to the tune of six hundred thousand yen.”Swept along by his tone of conviction, I could hardly demur.It was true enough that with eupcaccias going at twenty thousand yen a head, and thirty of them in the suitcase, his figure had some basis in reality.“Something’s funny.” The shill was not to be put off.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You’ve been letting on that you’re a paid crew member, but this means you’re no such thing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’re a paying passenger.”“What, for a paltry six hundred thousand yen?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even for a screening test to permit me to come aboard it’d be a real bargain.I’m really grateful, let me tell you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You should be too—especially considering that neither of you has paid for your ticket yet.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When you figure it all out, it’s as if you’d each been paid a handsome sum already.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Let’s have no more complaints.” The shill and the girl seemed completely taken in.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You had to give the man credit for being a smooth talker.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I began to understand why he had asked for carte blanche in dealing with the shill.After a pause while he drained his third beer, he continued:“Well, as far as I can see, everybody’s had their say, and nobody’s come out the winner.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There don’t seem to be any real victims among us, either.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All we need now is some guarantee of mutual trust.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Mere verbal agreements aren’t enough, and real intimacy—the kind where you look right up each other’s behinds—takes too long.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the old days, people exchanged hostages as a kind of mutual check.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
So I have an idea.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What if we all show each other a few old scars?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Everybody’s got something he’d just as soon people never got wind of—a tail he doesn’t want grabbed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Why don’t we all bring ours into the open, right now?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then nobody would feel tempted to do anything nasty like running to the police.”“How do we know the other guy isn’t making it up?” asked the shill.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“How about you, Komono—can a guy like you bring yourself to be that honest?”“You don’t understand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Anybody can invent a story that makes him look good, but it’s next to impossible to invent weaknesses for yourself.” He half shut his eyes and licked his lips, serenely confident.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If you think you can do it, try.”“You might be right,” said the girl, opening her second beer.“When I’m borrowing money, I can think of things, all right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".” Grudgingly, the shill opened his third beer.The insect dealer gave a couple of dry coughs and went on.“Captain,” he said, “would you mind setting up a tape recorder?It’s a peculiar thing, but for some reason people can’t lie when a microphone is staring them in the face.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, later the tape could serve as material evidence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’re excused, of course; this ship itself is your weak spot.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Let’s flip a coin to see who goes first, shall we?”Nobody objected.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"First the girl won, then the shill.“Okay, turn on the tape, recorder.” The insect dealer started his confession.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“My basic reason for joining the SDF was that I liked uniforms and guns.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was disappointed right from the start.From the time I was a kid, I was no good at fitting into groups, see, so I hoped I could straighten myself out with that uniform—but it got to be too idiotic.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I decided I’d have been better off becoming a priest.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Finally I got so fed up with it all that I took to stealing pistols and selling them to yakuza on the black market.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As to who my smuggling partner was, you’ll probably be hearing soon enough from the horse’s mouth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".” He glanced at the shill, who reached out and covered the mike with his hand.“Hey, no fair.” His speech was slurred; apparently he was the kind whose liquor didn’t show in his face.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Everybody’s got the right to decide for themselves what to tell about, right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, the statute of limitations ran out on that ages ago.”“Okay, we’ll write that one off.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Take your hand away.Anyway, three times it went off without a hitch, but the fourth time I blew it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They had a room displaying small arms from around the world, including a Belgian gun called an M.W.Vaughn.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Ever hear of it?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s one helluva gun—functions like a machine gun, and it’s no bigger than a pistol.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Its only flaw is the price tag.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So what was I supposed to do, just stand there with my tongue hanging out?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My grades were high, so I was able to get a special study pass.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The room had nearly a thousand guns on display, and right in the doorway was a computer-controlled surveillance apparatus.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The system was surprisingly lax.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When you went in you inserted your pass in the apparatus, which recorded your name and weight, and then when you went out you put your pass in again.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was set up so if your weight showed a discrepancy of ten ounces or more, the door would lock and an alarm would sound.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So how do you think I did it?”“You must have taken it apart and carried it out piece by piece,” said the girl, stating the obvious.“Of course.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Piece by piece, starting in the middle, till finally only the gun barrel was left.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That alone weighed almost two pounds.”“I’ve got it.” This was the sort of problem I liked.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I thought I could give a better answer than she had, anyway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“All you’d have to do is carry in something that weighed a little over a pound, and leave it there.”“Too lacking in originality.” He disposed of my idea like that.“They’d already anticipated that little tactic.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When you got up to go, you pushed a switch to signal you were through, and if at that time the weight for the area around the desk in a three-foot radius wasn’t zero, a red light flashed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even the wastepaper basket sounded an alarm if you put in anything weighing more than two ounces.”“Hmm, that makes it tough.” The shill was staring into space, tracing squares in his lap.“Don’t keep us guessing.” The girl crossed her legs on the chaise longue, slipping off her low-heeled sandals and throwing them on the floor.“There was one blind spot.” Bobbing his head up and down, lips pursed in triumph, he went on: “What do you think it was?The drinking fountain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After setting everything up so carefully, they went and installed a drinking fountain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That set me thinking, and finally it hit me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Are you ready?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I brought in three cups’ worth of water in a plastic bag and dumped it down the drinking fountain.”Silence, as everyone absorbed this.“And you failed anyway?” The girl’s voice was hushed.“Hell, no.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I made clean off with it.”“But wasn’t that why they threw you out?”“Oh, my luck ran out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had all the parts sewn up in my pillow, nice and cozy, and then those bastards go and conduct a metal-detector test right in the barracks, of all places.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was no way out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Hiding loot is always harder than lifting it.”“That may be a tail,” said the shill, “but if you ask me, it’s like a lizard’s tail that’s already broken off—not worth a damn.” He sprawled back against the armrest of the chaise longue, and slurped the rest of his beer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Once you were discharged, the charges were dropped, weren’t they?”“The hell they were.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll have you know I’m on the wanted list right now; I skipped out before they could make me stand trial.All right, now it’s your turn.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Let’s have it straight, please.” The shill looked wordlessly from me to the insect dealer and back again.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He sniffed, and looked at the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then, as if resigned, he took a sheaf of cards out of his hip pocket and said, “Take a look.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Why the dickens they do it I don’t know, but they all issue these cards, like bank cash cards.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Twenty-six of them I’ve got, and all from different loan companies.”“It’s so they can exchange data among themselves, using computers.”“Counting the ones without cards, it comes to over thirty companies.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ve borrowed a grand total of seventy million yen.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I used to be a collector for loan sharks myself, so I know all the angles.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m notorious.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Almost every one of their offices has my picture on the wall, marked ‘Wanted.’ ”“So that’s why you were in disguise.” I felt relieved, as one of my unspoken questions about him was answered.“I understand there are hit men out looking for me full time.I’ll bet the reward is pretty high, too.” He paused.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“That’s all.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You can turn off the tape recorder.”“Hmm,” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Not bad, not bad.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Yes, I’d say that qualifies you to come on board.” He pushed the pause button and said, “Captain, you’d better confiscate those cards as material evidence.”“Oh, no you don’t.” That familiar sleight of hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The cards were gone before my outstretched hand could reach them.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The tape’s enough, isn’t it?”“Well, all right, if that’s the way you want it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then shall we proceed?” The insect dealer made a circle with the fingers of one hand, and peered through it at the girl.“No, I can’t.” Her face stiffened, as if coated with starch.“Why not?”“It’s too embarrassing.”“Of course it’s embarrassing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Otherwise it wouldn’t be worth anything, would it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Come on now, don’t hold back.” Suddenly the effects of all the beer I had drunk began to tell on me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Filled with a mixture of revulsion and anticipation, I could not look squarely at her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My pulse was pumping like a treadle under my ears.“I don’t mean that,” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I mean it’s embarrassing because I haven’t got anything to tell.”“Look, why don’t you let her off the hook?” It was the shill, coming to her support for once.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was there some secret between them he didn’t want her to divulge?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“There’s no way she could get out of here on her own, anyway.”“Why not?”“Because one of the loan collectors who’s after me wants her as security.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Let’s get back to where we were.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We’ve all shown our tails now, and we’re all on an equal footing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You can be honest with me, Captain, so tell me, what’s going on?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Who is that character I was chasing before?”The insect dealer resettled himself on the parapet and began to rock backward and forward; apparently the beer had dulled his fear of heights.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The girl, still sitting cross-legged, stretched out her arms, her clasped hands turned palm out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Her too-short skirt was like a rope around my neck.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The gazes of all three of them seemed to grab me by the lapels and shake me without mercy.“I truly do not know.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Until I heard you tell about him, I had no idea—the whole idea was frightening.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But the more I think about it, the more it explains.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You see, I was blaming it all on rats.Would you mind telling me in detail what you saw?”“You first.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m not going to have you changing your story to fit mine.”“Relax, will you?” The insect dealer changed his forward-and-back motion to a right-and-left sway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Here’s our chance to prove to the captain that he wasn’t wrong to let us on board.”“Watch out, don’t fall!” the girl cautioned.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Abruptly he ceased moving, as if caught in a freeze-frame.“My story is simple.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Somebody poked his face in from a back tunnel, so I followed him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s all.”“Are you sure it was a person?”“What else could it have been?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There sure as hell aren’t any rats that big.”“To tell the truth, for some time now I’ve sensed the presence of an intruder.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But it’s too quick for a human.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll see something move out of the corner of my eye, and by the time I look that way, it’s gone.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The center of your field of vision registers shapes, but the periphery is sensitive only to movement, you know.So a rat and a person could look the same.”“Does a rat wear sneakers and a jacket?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll grant you he was fast.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Seemed right at home in there, too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He followed a complicated course, and kept running ahead without ever slowing down or showing the least hesitation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just when I’d think I had him cornered, he’d find a way out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He knew his way around, all right.”“How far did you go?”“How do I know?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I doubt if I could find my way back again, either.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We went down a couple of flights of stairs, but it was uphill most of the way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Twice we came on running water, and once it was wide enough and deep enough to call it a sort of river.”“You went all the way there?”“That’s where I lost him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just when I thought I had him, he vanished into the air.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How on earth he got over that river I can’t figure out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Aren’t there any other ways in and out of this place?There must be.”“I don’t know too much about that end.”“Well, I sure hope it doesn’t turn out that somebody you didn’t know about’s been living over there, watching every damn thing you do.”“Did you notice a peculiar smell?” asked the girl.“Yeah, maybe I did,” he said.“Just before the river there was a narrow bottleneck, wasn’t there?” I asked.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“That’s the far boundary of the quarry.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve had it in mind to close that off—but still, it’s unbelievable!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s a good four miles that far and back, as the crow flies, and you’ve got cliffs, valleys, and all kinds of hurdles in the way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I never thought those people would go so far as to cross over that boundary.”“‘Those people’?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then you do know something you’re not letting on.”“Oh, they’re nothing to worry about.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The Broom Brigade, they’re called—an old people’s club.”“The broom what?” The insect dealer, who’d been sitting stiffly, stuck out his paw.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His glasses slipped askew.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His right eye was watering.“The Broom Brigade.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They do volunteer work, sweeping and cleaning, as a public service.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Their average age is seventy-five.”“And they live somewhere in this quarry?”“No, they probably just use it for their garbage dump.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In any case, they’re over two miles from here.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You remember, don’t you, Komono?” I said, using his name for the first time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With some trepidation at this change in our relationship, I went on, “On the shortcut, that slight outcropping of rock—”“That’s it!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was the smell of garbage,” interrupted the girl, her mind still on the same track.“But why would a cleaning brigade come spying around here?” The shill too had a one-track mind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“And whoever was doing the running wasn’t any seventy-five years old, either.”“It might have been someone from the supervisory squad.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I gather they use younger people for supervisors.”“Is it a large battalion?”“Thirty-five to forty men.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They work only late at night, so hardly anybody’s ever seen them.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They go around in a straight line, swinging their brooms in time to martial songs.”“Sounds creepy.”“As far as I know, nobody’s ever complained about the noise.They sing in hushed voices, so the sound must get mixed in with the sighing of the wind and the swish of their brooms.” Layer upon layer of heavy, relaxed inebriation settled over everyone but the girl.13THE BROOM BRIGADE WASWRITTEN UP IN THE PAPERThe Broom Brigade’s been written up in the local paper; everybody from this area knows about them.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It all began with a movement to collect empty beverage cans, organized by a few elderly citizens.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They attracted a growing following, and the movement began earning a name for itself as a way of getting old people reinvolved in society and giving them new purpose in life.Gradually it became more structured, with uniforms and a badge showing two crossed bamboo brooms.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Clad in dark blue uniforms like combat suits, the oldsters parade around in the middle of the night, when ordinary people are in bed, and sweep the streets till dawn.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They work in the wee hours because generally old people are early risers anyway, and because they don’t want to get in people’s way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Imagine them marching abreast in a single row, softly intoning an old war song and swinging their brooms in rhythm, casting a shadow under the streetlights like some monster centipede creeping through the night.There definitely is something creepy about them.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The matter of the martial air was debated in the city council, but the issue was laid to rest when one councillor declared that the words, beginning “Here we bide, hundreds of miles from home .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".” expressed the universal grief of soldiers everywhere, and that to lump this with the “Man-of-war March” was a piece of left-wing radical hokum.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The brigade members’ practice of soliciting donations in areas they had swept, moreover, won acceptance with the reasonable argument that it’s only wholesome good neighborliness to give a helping hand to senior citizens seeking to build their own retirement home.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As a matter of fact, the city of Kitahama is exceptionally clean.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You can walk the streets barefoot without dirtying your feet.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Not only that: the city has become a leader in cutting the use of synthetic detergents.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"How could the authorities fail to be pleased?“What a disgusting bunch of old men,” snorted the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Must be something wrong with them.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Doesn’t sound normal to me.” He slipped down from his perch on the parapet, came over by the table, and rested his cheek in one hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
In the depths of his glasses his gaze flickered.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Basically,” he went on,“nobody who enjoys cleaning up can be worth much.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I hate it, myself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"‘A place for everything and everything in its place’—you can take that motto and stuff it.”“Besides,” said the shill, “there’s something disturbing about the whole thing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We don’t know beans about them, and here they’ve been staring up our asses.” As he spoke, he pulled the bowstring on the crossbow and fixed an arrow in place.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“What I can’t figure out is where in hell did that spy disappear to?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was like a subway platform out there, steep cliffs on right and left, up to the edge of the water.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The only way to escape would be to dive in.”“Then he must have swum across,” said the insect dealer, sinking to a sitting position on the floor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I did not at all like where he was: from there he could peer though the table legs at the girl, sitting cross-legged on the chaise longue, and see right between her legs.“Impossible.” The shill too seemed to take notice of the situation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All of a sudden he took aim with the crossbow and put his finger on the trigger.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The other side of the river was a sheer wall, straight up to the ceiling.”“Put that thing down,” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Instinctively he snatched up the Uzi that was leaning against the parapet, cocked it, and rose to a crouch.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Save it for when you’re sober.” A thin smile on his lips, the shill ignored this and pulled the trigger.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The arrow missed its target for the second time, skimming by the beer can and ricocheting with a dry scrape somewhere off in the distance.“Look who’s talking,” he said mockingly to the insect dealer.“Aren’t you a little old to be playing with toys?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or is a gun freak like you happy to get his hands on anything?” The insect dealer lowered his gun without comment.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But he made no move to go back under the table.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The girl started to speak, then clamped her mouth shut.Flicking the bowstring, the shill added, “Captain, what do you say?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Shall we head back to that river for a look?”“Too late now,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Better wait till the sun comes up.”“Underground, what difference does it make?” he protested.“There’s no day or night in a cave, is there?” He slurped up the rest of his noodles and started in on his fourth beer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“My mental faculties are sharpest when I’m drinking, believe it or not.Although noodles and sardines make a hell of a combination.”“No need to go searching them out, you know,” said the insect dealer, picking up the last sardine by its tail and curling his tongue around it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If they have something on their minds, they’ll be back.”“No,” said the shill, “we’ve got to take the initiative.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Don’t forget, that place where they’re dumping their garbage is right next door.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Who do they think they are, anyway, cleaning up the streets at our expense?”“And it’s not just ordinary garbage.” The girl clung tenaciously to her theme.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“That smell is from some harmful substance, I’m positive.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You know they say you can make a lot of money cleaning up industrial wastes.”“That’s right,” agreed the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Whoever heard of building an old people’s home out of the proceeds from street sweeping?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It would never be enough.” The two of them seemed to be growing in rapport.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Some ticket for survival,” he wound up sardonically.“Now it turns out we’re being slowly poisoned by toxic fumes!” A snail covered with wire netting full of gaping holes, imagining itself shielded by a giant shell of some superstrong alloy: how soft-headed can you get!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was a pop in the vicinity of my lower eyelids like that of a tiny balloon.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My vision clouded, as tears sprang to my eyes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I remembered having had the same experience when Inototsu locked me up in this quarry, chained like a dog.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I read somewhere that there are three kinds of tear glands, each used with a different degree of frequency.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"These tears probably came from a gland I rarely used; that would explain the popping noise, as if the tear ducts were clogged from lack of use.“I’ll bet you it was a spy who came to see if the captain was dead yet or not,” said the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Right about now they must be in a tizzy as they find out that ( a) the captain is still alive, and ( b) he’s got three new people in with him.” She stared in sudden surprise at my face.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“What’s the matter—are you crying?”“Of course not.” Ashamed to wipe them away, I let the tears trickle down the wings of my nose.“The captain has no reason to cry,” said the insect dealer, eyes tightly shut, leaning on the table with his elbows planted far apart.“They could be tears of mortification,” said the shill with emphasis, spraying a mist of saliva.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“A ship’s captain can’t very well sit back and watch while his air supply is slowly poisoned, after all.”“I told you before—I’m going to close off that passageway just as soon as I can get to it.”“No, you’ve got to act now.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Look, that guy came poking his nose in here only a little while ago.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What’s the Broom Brigade anyway?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Just a bunch of decrepit old street cleaners.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Let’s go have it out with them!”“Or we could simply assert our territorial rights, much as it might inconvenience them,” said the insect dealer, crawling up on the table like a wounded sea slug.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“They look on it as a garbage dump, but we can put the space to far more significant use.Remember, Japan is a very small country, suffering from acute space deficiency, getting worse all the time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“What are you going to do, plant a flag?” The girl kept staring curiously at my tears.“Why not?” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“That or something else.” He spoke with great assurance, driving his words home.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The thing to do is to see that they give us service at a special rate, or pay us for the space they’re using.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Somehow we’ve got to draw a firm line.” Despite small individual differences, overall it appeared that everybody but me was in favor of some form of association with the Broom Brigade.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had a sense of double defeat: first the spy and then, as if that weren’t humiliation enough, the fact that it was the shill, not me, who discovered him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The Broom Brigade, for its part, having had its spy exposed, would surely be devising some swift countermeasure.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If a confrontation was inevitable, what better time than now, when I was flanked by two self-appointed bodyguards?I decided to let the girl score a few points.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I give up—you’re right,” I said, addressing her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“They’ve been scattering around a chromic waste fluid.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Highly poisonous.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You know,” I added, “ninja used to have keen noses too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even in the dark they could distinguish people and objects by scent, like dogs.” (This comparison was perhaps a touch inept.)",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“They say the whole body of ninja lore comes down to perfecting the sense of smell.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Why, you’re probably qualified to be a ninja right now.” As it happened, my association with the Broom Brigade was a good deal more intimate than any of them suspected.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Our first contact dated from just about a year ago.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As the girl had divined, we were engaged in the illegal disposal of industrial waste (although the instigator was not them, but me).",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Once a week they furnished five polyethylene containers full of a heavily chromic waste fluid, fifty-eight times the permitted level of concentration.It was a pretty awful job, and the pay was accordingly high.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To dispose of one container was worth 80,000 yen.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s 400,000yen a week; 1,600,000 yen a month.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
More money than I could ever hope to lay hands on again.Of course it wasn’t as if I’d drawn up a contract directly with the Broom Brigade.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was a middleman.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Every Tuesday just before daybreak, he came by with the goods, hauling five containers along the town road in a pickup truck.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The rest was up to me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"First, using a pulley, I lowered them to the roof of the abandoned car I used for camouflage (a Subaru 360); then I shoved them in through the back-seat window, where the pane was missing, and loaded them aboard ship in a handcart.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s fairly hard labor, but when you want to raise money in a hurry, you can’t pick and choose.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, I didn’t want anybody finding out about my toilet.Before setting up in this business, I did the necessary groundwork.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I couldn’t rest easy without having some idea of where things flushed down that toilet would end up.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Common sense said it was somewhere out at sea.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But where?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The complex topography of the sea bottom made it impossible to predict.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Since I knew I would be handling illegal wastes, it was imperative to investigate the matter thoroughly beforehand: if toxic substances and corpses of small animals started popping up along the shoreline, people would inevitably ask questions.One windless day, choosing an hour when there was little current, I flushed twenty ounces of red food coloring down the toilet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I then kept a steady watch from atop the pedestrian bridge on Skylark Heights, which commands an excellent view, but saw no telltale red stain anywhere on the surface of the water.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Nor at any time since then have I even heard rumors of dead fish floating nearby.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The underground water vein from the toilet must empty very far out at sea.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or perhaps an especially swift current sweeps the outlet clean.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As long as no one raises any fuss, there’s no problem.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The work goes along smoothly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In any case, the world is coming to an end soon, so what difference does it make?Then, early this month, things suddenly changed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"One day shortly after the rainy season was declared officially over, I was waiting in my jeep for a red light to change at the corner by the Plum Blossom Sushi Shop, when next to me there pulled up a black van like a paddy wagon or one of those paramilitary soundtrucks used by the neo-fascist right wing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On its side was an emblem of two crossed brooms, and on the corner of one bumper, a flag bearing the same emblem fluttered in the breeze.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So this is the famous Broom Brigade patrol car, I thought, having heard about it from our middleman.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I gazed at it not with any strong sense of identification but with genuine (quite neutral) interest; we were, after all, business partners.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then my eyes met those of the man sitting next to the driver.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A big fellow, whose head brushed against the car ceiling, he was staring intently into my jeep.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shock was like sticking your hand into the chill vapor of dry ice, expecting hot steam.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Large sunglasses and a goatee had altered his appearance, but there was no mistaking that green hunting cap.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was my biological father, Inototsu.I had not seen him in five years.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just to find him in apparent good health was bad enough (a more fitting fate being pauperism or softening of the brain), but of all things, here he was seated in the patrol car of my best customer, the Broom Brigade, as snug as a yolk in its egg.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Barely six feet away, the facings on the left sleeve of his dark blue uniform were plainly legible: thee gold inverted V’s.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Gold for the rank of general, three for the highest grade within his rank.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That made him their chief, or marshal, or supreme commander.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Of course I couldn’t have known—but still, I had picked one hell of a business partner.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My head throbbed as if I’d come down with Raynaud’s disease,* and after the light turned green I had trouble putting the car in gear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"* A circulatory disorder affecting habitual chain-saw users.The reaction from his side was swift: the following week, orders for work were abruptly terminated.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Naturally, my first suspicions rested with the intermediary, Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Unless he had said something, I figured, not even Inototsu was crafty enough to connect me with the consignments of hexavalent chromium.Probably, carried away by some desire to boast of his own evildoing (since bullying his family was part of the sadism he secreted like poison), Inototsu had told his followers about meeting me in front of the sushi shop; Sengoku, who happened to be present, then boasted that he knew me as the final recipient of the illegal wastes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
For Inototsu to order an immediate halt to all deliveries would be the logical next step.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His goal would be to starve me out, cutting off my supplies and attempting to recover my territory.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As the one who had chained me to the toilet, he was no doubt well aware of its power.Not surprisingly, Sengoku firmly denied my allegations.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For his services, he pointed out, I regularly paid him twenty percent of the intake, which made him no less a victim of the work stoppage than me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That too made sense.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No matter how attractive the Broom Brigade’s terms, he could do nothing without first finding another safe place for disposal of the chromium waste.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Still vaguely suspicious, I resolved to leave the negotiations up to him, and meanwhile to prepare for a long siege.“And now that I think of it,” I concluded, “it was just about then that I first began detecting the presence on board ship of what I took to be a rat.”“You know, if it were me, I wouldn’t trust that Sengoku person an inch.” Tracing endless small circles on the armrest of the chaise longue, the girl recrossed her legs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She had sweet, unpretentious kneecaps.“I agree,” said the shill, licking flecks of saliva from the corners of his mouth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Who knows—that guy who gave me the slip before might have been Sengoku himself.”“You have nothing but supposition to base that on.”“Here goes,” said the insect dealer, carefully lighting a cigarette.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“My last one for today.”“Actually I don’t trust Sengoku one hundred percent myself,” I added.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The name means ‘a thousand koku of rice,’ and it has a great air of nobility about it (and for all I know, his ancestors were aristocrats), but when you come down to it, he’s nothing but the son of a confectioner who gave his creditors the slip and set up a little confectionery just off the town road.” He’s three or four years younger than me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The store—you know the kind of place—has a lattice front backed by glass instead of paper, with a faded sign; he lives there with his mother, who’s involved in some religious sect or other, and often goes out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They sell things like cheap sweets and snack breads, milk and fried donuts made from unsold leftovers from other stores.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The one exception is their homemade sweet-potato cakes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Made from real sweet potatoes with plenty of butter, they would be any baker’s pride; they fill the store with a wonderful fragrance, and were even marketed wholesale to coffee shops and restaurants near the station, with great success.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sengoku’s father was formerly a baker in a confectionery factory, specializing in sweet-potato cakes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m fond of them, and they’re easy to pop in your mouth, so I got in the habit of dropping by every morning to buy them fresh-baked.Besides, if you time it right, you can get all the way there and back without encountering anyone.One morning about six months after I’d started doing this, Sengoku’s mother was out, and he was manning the counter himself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’d seen him working in the back before that, but this was the first time we’d ever spoken.“Ah, Mr. Inokuchi,” he says.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“That is your name, isn’t it?”“No.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’re thinking of the old fishing inn that used to be down under the cliff.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You can just call me Mole.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Back when I worked as a photographer, that’s what everyone called me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I look like one, don’t I?”“Not really.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Moles have long whiskers.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Are you sure it isn’t bad for you to eat so many of those?”“Oh, no—sweet potatoes are an excellent source of vitamin C and fiber.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"An ideal food, in fact.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Their only drawback is the price.”“Goes up all the time.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They used to be the poor man’s staple.No more.”“Where’s your mother?” I asked.“Busy, lately, with church duties.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She just got promoted to junior executive.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s a little hard on me—I’ve got to do everything here myself now, from laying in stock and mashing and straining potatoes to timing the ovens and minding the stove.”“Church?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You mean she’s a member of some religious outfit?”“You mean she’s never invited you to join?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She must have you figured for a hopeless degenerate.”We both burst out laughing.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It felt pleasantly intimate, like sharing a secret.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had no great need for friendship, you understand, but I did feel a bond of sorts with the man.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As he lined up the cakes on thin strips of paper, arranged them in boxes, and rang up the bill, he went on talking in a quiet, unobtrusive way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He asked no questions, veiled or otherwise, about my life-style (of which he must have had some inkling).",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It seems now almost as if he was actively cultivating my friendship.“My father ran off and disappeared,” he said, “and no one knows what became of him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Making sweet-potato cakes is damned boring.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not only that, it takes up all your time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There’s a big difference between just bored, you see, and busy bored.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Too much of that can take away your manhood.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can remember my mother pulling down my father’s pants and blowing on his thing—which would be all shrunken up like dog crap—or winding her prayer beads around it and chanting an invocation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You try baking one hundred of these a day, and it’ll happen to you too, he said; I swore it wouldn’t—in fact, I wished it would.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
So maybe that’s it: both my father and I lack strength of character.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When by some fluke guys like him and me get lucky, it’s about as fitting as a fur coat in July.“One time about three years ago, a friend of my father’s who worked as a tipster for the bicycle races got sick, and Dad was hired to fill in for him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Racing tips don’t usually amount to much anyway, so you didn’t need any special knowledge or inside information to do the job.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Racing tips always turn out wrong, and if his did too, so what?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But for better or worse, three days in a row he picked a long shot that came home.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That kind of news spreads faster than an epidemic, so all of a sudden there was a rush of business.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Anybody with sense would have hightailed it, but after the monotony of sweet potatoes, Dad was having the time of his life.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Finally he fell in his own trap.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He took all the proceeds from those three days and bet the whole thing on the next race.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I don’t have to tell you what happened.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The tipster got after him to produce the money, and when it wasn’t there he beat him up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He had to go into hiding, bleeding heavily.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It made me think: maybe our family name really is an old one.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It must have taken a long time to produce someone as foggy-brained as my father.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Of course, from his point of view it must have been a dream come true.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No more sweet potatoes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He’s probably cured of his impotence by now.“What about you?” I asked.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Is it your turn?”“There are signs.”“Shall I see what I can do for you, before your old lady starts chanting invocations over you?”“It won’t work.”“How do you know?” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Don’t give up so fast.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I tell you what—give me a hand in my business.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It may not be as exciting as a tipster, but it’s a great opportunity for you to make use of any sixth sense you may have inherited.”“Forget it,” he said flatly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Remember what I said—sweet-potato-cake bakers are bored to death and busied to death.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I haven’t got the time, and my mother would never let me, anyway.”“As a junior executive, she must have a lot of financial obligations.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What if you made enough money to cover them all?”“No, no.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can see it now.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I jump at some story that’s too good to be true and there I am, a replay of my father.”“Whether you go for it or not is up to you, but let me at least explain the deal.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Here’s a hint: suppose there was a secret manhole somewhere where you could get rid of anything.Nothing barred.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What would you use it for?” The answer wasn’t three days in coming.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Like a thirteen-year-old wrapped up in a computer game, Sengoku became completely engrossed in looking for ways to use such a manhole.From the outside he and I may look as different as a pig and a mouse, I thought, but we are kindred spirits.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not only because we share the fate of having been born to a no-good louse of a father, but because we are both addicted to outlandish ideas.He soon arrived at a Grand Manhole Theory.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"One summer years ago, he had tried to run a beachhouse.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"From this he learned that the issue is not whether to use real tatami mats or plastic covering; nor is it how many showers you install, how many gallons of hot water per minute you allow, how many blocks of ice or watermelons you lay in—none of that makes a particle of difference.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Customers are smart.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They let their noses lead them.The thing to do, in other words, is to pour as much money as you can into the rest rooms.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Sanitation comes first and second.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For that reason, flushing toilets are a must.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the end, you stand or fall by the size of your sewage tank.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you fail to appreciate that fact, then before you know it the smell of ammonia will permeate the place, business will fall off, and that will be that.Japanese history books tell about “moving the capital,” a ritual that took place at fixed intervals in ancient Japan.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The reason for this was the same, I think—people’s sensitivity to smell.With a dense population, waste disposal eventually becomes a problem.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sewage, trash .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"and dead bodies.Once, when I was a boy on a school excursion to Kyoto, somebody explained that one particular ancient classical poem from that era (when, exactly, I don’t recall) meant roughly that whenever the wind blew a certain way, it stunk to high heaven.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I remember how shocked I was.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But back then, of course, they didn’t bury their dead.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They piled them up on the ground, say in a bamboo grove on the outskirts of town.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
(Maybe that explains why Kyoto is famous for its bamboo shoots to this day; I don’t know.),Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Anyway, it’s obvious why they would have had to move the capital periodically.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
People can’t win out over waste matter; at some point it takes over and gets the better of them.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In foreign countries, you often come across the ruins of abandoned cities and towns.Buildings made of stone couldn’t easily be moved, so raw sewage and dead bodies accumulated, epidemics were rampant, and the cities were left to fall into ruins.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Wooden structures disappear without a trace, but they might have been that much more sanitary.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The only way to avoid having to move, or leave empty ruins, is to build your city around a large manhole.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The ideal sewage system, in other words, is like a giant umbilical cord: the lifeline of the city of the future.Sengoku’s first practical application of his manhole theory was to take over the disposal of aborted fetuses from local obstetricians.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The plan was successful as well as clever.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Previously, the only recourse had been the makeshift device of mixing the fetuses in furtively with raw waste from the fish market.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This system had never appealed to those involved, and they were only too glad to wash their hands of it.Sengoku and I quickly set up a company that we called SWAMDI, or Special Waste Matter Disposal, Inc. “What title do you want?” I asked him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You can be president, or executive director, or secretary-general.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Take your pick.”“What will you be?” he answered.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Chairman?”“Just plain manhole manager is good enough for me.”“Then I’ll be secretary-general.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No president or vice-president.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"More democratic that way, don’t you think?” he said, adding, “Are there any other members?”“For now it’s just you and me,” I said.“Even better,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The more people, the less each one’s share of the take.”“The fewer faucets,” I said, “the less leaking.”“Exactly.”“So for the time being,” I continued, “I want there to be just one.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not that I don’t trust you—I do, but I think you’re better off not knowing too much about the manhole.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then there’s no way you could tell anybody anything.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I know it seems unfriendly .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“No, I don’t mind,” he said cheerfully.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If anything ever happened, I’d get off lighter not knowing.” The very unconventionality and flamboyance of this first project of ours made it difficult to attract orders.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And unless you’re dealing in dead bodies or industrial waste, the disposal business pays next to nothing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Finally, in our third month, we began handling hexavalent chromium.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Soon we were doing so at regular intervals, and this became our chief source of revenue.Sengoku gave spending money to his mother, who was still busy proselytizing, and talked her into letting him virtually close up the store.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sometimes, when he was in the mood, he would bake some of his prize sweet-potato cakes just for me.That was all about a year ago.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Since then everything had been going smoothly, until I ran into Inototsu in front of the Plum Blossom Sushi Shop.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sengoku and I worked together well, in a spirit of genuine friendship.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides meeting once a week at 4 p.m.for the delivery of hexavalent chromium, we met often in a back room of his store (now closed), to drink coffee, chat, exchange last month’s magazines, and play an occasional game of chess.Sometimes we would drink a toast to the manhole.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Sengoku used to declare that he had never known such a sense of fulfillment in all his life.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The vague anxiety he felt was probably due to his recovery from impotence, but that, he said, smiling, was like the sense of exhilaration you get after washing your face with fine soap.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Time seemed to weigh on his hands, so sometimes I had him help me with other things besides the SWAMDI work.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Things like purchasing and transporting supplies for the ark: parts for air conditioners, materials for gunpowder, and so on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I realized now that I should have explained everything to him then.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It wasn’t that I doubted him at all.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I fully intended to give him a ticket to survival too, but I kept putting it off.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My failure to include him owed solely to my own lack of decisiveness.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He must have suspected something, but he never once asked anything approaching a question— either because he knew his place or because he had suffered a lot for a man his age.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He had a habit of saying, “Peace is wonderful.”“So we beat out your friend Sengoku, eh?” said the shill, upending his fourth can of beer and sucking up the last remaining froth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“He’d be mad as hell if he knew.”“That’s why I feel guilty.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll have to tell him about you three, who’ve contributed nothing, and get his approval after the fact.”“I wouldn’t trust that person Sengoku,” said the girl, leaning back and tugging at the hem of her skirt.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Man-made leather hardly stretches at all, so the only effect was to accentuate the gap between her knees.“Try to remember, Captain,” said the shill, stifling a yawn.“Was it before or after you ran into Inototsu that you began to sense the presence of an intruder?”“How do I know?”“But that’s the crux of it all: that’ll tell you if you can trust your secretary-general or not.”“Why?”“It only makes sense,” said the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“That man Sengoku sounds too reserved.” She covered the end of her sentence with a smile, to keep me from opening my mouth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Are you sure he wasn’t in league with the Broom Brigade from the start?” The question was not lacking in merit.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I myself wondered at what point Sengoku had learned of Inototsu’s connection with the Broom Brigade.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He certainly knew both that the hexavalent chromium came from there and that Inototsu was my biological father.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If he had remained silent while knowing Inototsu to be the head of the Broom Brigade, that suggested not mere reserve but a deliberate lack of candor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Had he wanted to keep his trump card hidden until I was more open about my life in the quarry?The insect dealer slumped from the table down onto the floor.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He landed in a sitting position, eyes half open, but the angle of his neck showed he was fast asleep.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Too bad—he was back in position to look up her skirt but unable to do anything about it.Now if only the shill would go to sleep too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I threw him his fifth beer.“Shall we get ready to turn in?” I said.“Are you serious?” The shill opened his can, peering under the table.“That’s right—don’t you know what time it is?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s still only five after eight.” The girl too looked under the table, pressing her cheek against the chaise longue.Everyone but me disappeared below the surface of the table.As I kept my gaze level, I was assaulted by a wave of loneliness.Along with quiet came unrest.“The evening is young.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Shall we be setting off ?” said the shill.“Where to?” I asked.“Cave exploring, of course.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Spelunking.” He was still under the table.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“What’s this in the bag next to the Styrofoam box—a sleeping bag?”“Could be, if it’s got dark blue and red stripes.”“It’s covered with dust.”“That’s a top-quality brand, I’ll have you know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s in a different class from the chintzy stuff they palm off on you in sporting goods stores.”“What’s the difference?” asked the girl.“Enough so that a little dust doesn’t matter.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The bottom is triple-layered, with nylon, carbon fibers, and a spring, so that whether you’re lying on rocks, gravel, or whatever, you can sleep as comfortably as in a hotel bed.”The shill tucked the crossbow under his arm, inserted the remaining aluminum arrows in his belt, and stood up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Going around the table, he pulled out a sleeping bag and threw it down from the parapet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then he grabbed the shoulders of the insect dealer, who was asleep, leaning against the table leg, and began to shake him roughly.“Okay, Komono—time to go downstairs and go beddy-bye.Wake up, will you!”“There’s no point in moving too fast,” I counseled.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“At least let’s wait till Komono is sober.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The more help we have, the better.”“It’s worse to let the enemy get an edge on you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Don’t forget, the best defense is a good offense.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When politicians want to sound tough, they start talking about their indomitable resolve.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In a fight, the trick is to let fly a stiff punch that will put a damper on your opponent.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You can’t let guys like that Sengoku have it all their own way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Corrupts discipline.”“But there’s no hard evidence that he did turn traitor.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s all circumstantial, isn’t it?”“The best way to check it out is to go back there for a look.”“Why are you so eager for a fight?”“Drink sharpens my faculties, remember?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What is there to be afraid of ?”“All right, then, let me contact Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His radio is set up in the store.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If he’s there, that’ll give him an alibi, and disprove your idea that he’s in league with the Broom Brigade.”“I haven’t got anything personal against the guy, mind you,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“He’s just one possible suspect.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But go ahead and try to contact him, if that’ll make you feel better.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If he’s there, he may have some new information for you, and if he isn’t, the cloud of suspicion will deepen and you can throw away your doubts.”“I’ll give it a try—but somehow I just cannot believe that he’s that rotten.”My radio set was in locker number three.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The lock combination was easy to remember: 3-3-3.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I set the dial and switched it on.—Channel check.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Channel check.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Is anyone using this channel?No answer.—I repeat.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Hello, this is Mole.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Mole here.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Come in, please.No answer.Twice more I repeated the call; still there was no answer.“That settles it.” The shill clapped his hands.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You’d better give up, Captain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You want to take your camera along when we go?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I hear you’re a professional.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A photograph of the evidence could be worth a fortune.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And, Komono, you wake up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We’ve got to get moving.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Come on, I’ll take you downstairs.” He gave the insect dealer’s shoulder another hard shake, until at last Komono stood up, his whole body emanating sleepiness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even so, he never loosened his grip on the converted toy Uzi.“I’ve got to pee,” he mumbled.The insect dealer leaned on the shill, whose knees buckled.There was a good four-inch difference in their heights, and their weights must have differed to a corresponding degree.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Using my head as a prop as he went by, he passed in back of me, nearly knocking over a chair in the process.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He had terrible body odor.The odor itself was menacing, and even apart from that there’s something about big men I don’t like—probably from association with Inototsu.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As he wavered, unable to negotiate the turnabout, the shill grabbed his belt and held him up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Their unsteady footsteps receded down the staircase.“What shall I do?” The girl, still lying curled on the chaise longue, looked up at me with a troubled expression.“Can you swim?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I think probably we’ll be diving underwater.”“No, I can’t.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And I can’t hold my beer very well, either—unlike him.”“Then you shouldn’t come.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’d just end up an encumbrance.” As I went by, I gave her bottom a light slap.Without a flicker of expression, she sighed and said:“You know, you’ve got to hide your feelings better than that.”“Was it so obvious?”“Just like a dog looking for a pat on the head.”“You’ve got to be kidding.”“I think he wants to start a new life.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But don’t forget, he has only six months to live.”From down below, mixed with the sound of someone passing water, came the noise of voices quarreling.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then a queer voice, with laughter in it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A pause, and then the roar of the toilet being flushed, like a subway train thundering by in the middle of the night.“He seems nicer than he looks.”“He’s a fairly complicated person,” she answered thoughtfully.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“That may be the very reason why he acts so simpleminded.”“Has he ever used violence on you?”She put a hand on her hip where I had slapped her, and said nothing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"From below, the shill’s voice boomed out, echoing through the hold.“C’mon, Captain, let’s go!”14THE SHILL WENT FIRST,CROSS BOW IN HIS ARMSThe shill went first, clutching the loaded crossbow in his arms, and I followed, holding a trigger-operated tear gas cylinder.Kicking aside the sprung trap, we cut across the work hold, our footsteps resounding.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"From habit I tried to muffle mine, but the shill strode boldly ahead, apparently eager to cover ground.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Each step we took created its own echo.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The sum effect was a loud pattering like the noise of falling raindrops.“If we make this much noise they’ll hear us coming,” I said.“You know, whoever it was that got away before might have doubled back, and be waiting in ambush up ahead.”“That’s okay,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“As long as the enemy isn’t planning an all-out attack, it’s safer to make a lot of noise as you approach, whether it’s a bear you’re up against, or anything else.” By the time we reached the top of the lift, I was panting.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I stopped to lean against the wall and catch my breath, but the shill signaled me to hurry, indicating his watch.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After a few more yards we reached a room of medium size (still easily as big as a school auditorium), with a split-level floor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Light from the work hold provided soft, indirect illumination, covering the walls with a thick velvety sheen.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I planned to set up a periscope here someday for outdoor observation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For the present, taking advantage of the room’s soundproof structure, I used it to test-fire converted guns and mock bullets.“We’re up so high now, the ground must be just overhead,” said the shill, switching on his cap light.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His breathing remained unaffected by his exertion.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He must have a liver the size of a cow’s, I thought, able to convert beer directly into water.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was hard to believe the man had only six months to live.“Even so, there’s a good thirteen feet of solid rock up there, at the minimum,” I answered.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“So the law says.”“This is where the smell starts to get worse, notice?” he said.Besides the passageway through which we had come, two other ceiling-high openings extended on right and left, separated by a wall of rock.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill headed for the one on the right.“You got through there with no difficulty before, did you?” I asked.“Yes—why?”“There’s another booby trap planted in there.” This was one route I had figured an invader would be sure to take, and so, without begrudging the effort required to replace the laminated batteries once a month, I had installed a rather nasty device: a cylinder of cockroach spray, activated by an infrared sensor.“Oh, yeah?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I didn’t see anything.” He paused just before entering the passageway.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“There was a trap where we just came through, I know, but that’s all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I swear I never saw anything else.” He was telling the truth.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The safety mechanism was intact—and that wasn’t all: the working part of the cylinder had been hardened with spray coagulant, so skillfully that the eye could scarcely detect anything amiss.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This was the work of someone who knew all my secrets, I feared.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How long had I been under surveillance?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was no denying that Sengoku was in a position to know or surmise a great deal about my traps, having had access to the list of goods I ordered.“I wonder if all my traps have been tampered with,” I said.“Looks that way,” said the shill as we pushed forward, our only source of light the beams emanating from our helmets.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If there were any traps in working order, they’d have caught the intruders, and there’d be nothing to fear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It all goes to show our coming on board wasn’t such a bad idea, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Am I right?” Several yards ahead, the ceiling suddenly rose.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On the left was a gentle flight of stairs, and straight ahead, an array of small, irregular cubicles like ancient cave dwellers’ homes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The results of numerous test bores here had apparently been uniformly disappointing, each soon abandoned.“If the rubble were cleared away,” I said, “I thought this would make a good living area.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All private rooms.”“Great idea.” He turned around and grinned.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Put up steel bars and it would make a good isolation ward for violent patients.”“You know, I’m sorry,” I apologized.“What for?” We started down the stone staircase.“I should have leveled with you from the start.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was never any question of how I planned to use this quarry.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s got to do with the tickets to survival.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You see, this will be a bomb shelter in case of nuclear war.”“You’re weird, you know that?” He turned to look back at me without slowing his pace.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For a moment the light on his helmet blinded me.“The danger is real—and imminent, let me tell you,” I said.“Even if everybody goes around looking as if nothing were the matter.”“You’re not telling me anything I don’t already know,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I mean, really—tickets for survival, qualifications to board a ship, man-powered generators, air filters .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
what could it be but a bomb shelter?”“So you knew.”“Naturally.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You are weird.”“Then what made you suggest dumb ideas like vegetable storage, or a hotel for escaped criminals?”“Well, you’ve already managed some pretty good businesses on the side, haven’t you, Captain?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Disposing of fetuses, illegal dumping of toxic wastes .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“That’s different,” I protested.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I can call it quits anytime I want, without repercussions.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But fugitives and loony birds are human.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Once I let them on the ship, I couldn’t just toss them overboard whenever I felt like it.”“Like you will us.” The shill swallowed noisily, a sign of nerves.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Let me ask you one question.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As captain, what sort of people have you got in mind for your crew?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So far I get the idea you’re after people with more respectable backgrounds than us—but you know, respectability isn’t everything.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It could be boring as hell.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, we don’t know beans about who you really are, either, do we?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There’s no point in putting on airs.”“I’m not putting on airs.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But when the time comes, this ship’s crew will form the gene pool for future generations, don’t forget.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That leaves me with a heavy responsibility.”“Let me make one thing clear,” he said firmly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“As long as she stays, I’m not setting foot out of here, either.” We came upon a third large room.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This one was no simple rectangular shape but fairly convoluted, rooms within rooms extending along diagonal lines, high and low, each one supported by pillars.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The effect was one of haunting solemnity, as in some ancient cathedral.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or perhaps it would be truer to say that ancient cathedrals are a practical application of that effect.The shill lowered his voice.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Just between the two of us, she’s a very sick woman.”“She is?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What’s wrong with her?”“Cancer.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The bone marrow has lost its blood-making function.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The doctors give her six months to live.” I started to smile, and couldn’t breathe.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The air had turned hard as glass.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"One of them was lying, or both.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They hadn’t checked their stories out with each other, and ended by dropping separate fishlines.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was also the (admittedly small) possibility that both were telling the truth.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perhaps they had met by chance in some hospital waiting room.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It wasn’t inconceivable.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But I hadn’t the courage to ask.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Two cancer patients, each ignorant of the truth about himself/herself, each protecting the other: to take away their tickets to survival would be too cruel.In the wall facing us, at roughly three-foot intervals, were three tunnel entrances.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The one on the right had tracks and headed downhill; the center one was a dead end; and the one on the left was a gentle ascent, up stone steps.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The shill cocked his head.“That’s funny.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Which one was it?”“If you went to the river, it’s got to be the one on the left.”“I’m damned if I remember this—three passageways lined up side by side.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I guess it’s because we were running so fast.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I almost caught up with him here, too.”“The one on the right is another dead end.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It leads to a cave-in.”“You know your way around, don’t you?”“It’s part of my daily routine: morning exercises, and then two hours surveying or more.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve never missed a day yet.” The way leveled off, then went sharply downhill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We took the stairs by the wall.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A wind blew up at us, caused by the difference in temperatures.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Mixed with the smell of water and seaweed was the sharp odor of metallic ions.“Does that river empty into the sea?” he asked.“I think in part it leads into a spring at a Shinto shrine.There are a couple of noodle stands that serve rainbow trout.”“No effects as yet from the chromium?”“None that I know of.”“Later on, let me have a look at your surveyor’s map,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You’ve got one, haven’t you?”“There’s a rough sketch hanging on the wall of the conference room,” I said, unable to bring myself to say“operational headquarters.”“But you did do some surveying, didn’t you?” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You must have some record of your work.”So I did.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In fact, I had kept detailed records: sixteen ichnographic projection drawings that had taken a full six months to complete.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But for some reason, when I tried to convert them to orthographic projections I ran into trouble.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When I forced myself to visualize a perspective drawing of the quarry interior, landslides and cave-ins took place in my head.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Doubtless there were flaws in my surveying techniques and drawing ability.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But a bigger source of the problem, I believed, lay in the slipshod, hit-or-miss operations of the stone-quarrying authorities themselves, or their workmen.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No straight line was in fact straight, no right angle was in fact ninety degrees.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Errors accumulated little by little until finally southwest was skewed around to southeast, and the floor that should have been below a flight of stairs came out on top.Yet the degree of complexity involved could not be attributed solely to haphazard, trial-and-error procedures.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Four companies had leapfrogged through the mountain in fierce competition, ignoring all agreements.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If Company A crawled under the belly of Company B and tied up its legs, Company Bswung ahead of Company C and pinned down its head; Company C poked holes in Company D’s arse, while Company D slammed Company A in the ribs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Unreported cave-ins—even bloodshed—had apparently been everyday affairs.“Right now I’m working on a new system of surveying,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“By correlating temperature, humidity, and wind velocity, it seems to me you should be able to make a contour map, or a map of air pressure distribution, the kind they use in weather forecasts.”“Have you got something against it?”“Against what?”“Showing me your surveying maps.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Why are you holding back?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Is there some reason you can’t show them to me?”“They wouldn’t do you any good.”“I’m the one to decide that.”I did not like the way he was talking.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was like hitting someone and then complaining that he’d hurt your fist.“Listen—there’s the sound of running water.”“Yeah.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s not far now.”At the bottom of the slope the footing was suddenly precarious.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The walls were rougher too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The floor was littered with fragments of scaled-off stone.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Casually I turned and shone my flashlight on the point where the terrain changed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Along with the terrain, the color of the rock changed as well: the shift from dark green to a paler hue, the color of dried mugwort leaves, was clearly delineated in a slanting line.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That line was dotted with a number of holes, hollows in the wall where rock had scaled off.Second hollow from the top .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Outwardly it appeared no different from the others, but to me it bore a special significance: here was where I had set a charge of dynamite.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When the time came, one flick of the switch would blow it up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This very spot would mark the division between the interior and exterior of the ship.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The area from this point on would, in effect, cease to exist.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All I had to do was take a few steps back, pull the switch, and the shill too would be trapped in that nonexistent space, unable to move either forward or backward.If he thought he could hijack my ship with the aid of a simple map, he was dead wrong.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He underestimated me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This wasn’t the only place where I had set dynamite: in all there were nine hidden charges.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Wires connecting the detonators led to a single spot where I could set off all the explosives at one stroke.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"(For safety’s sake, I had used two separate systems of wiring.)",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The trigger switch also set off the infrared sensors for lighting in the captain’s cabin.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The manipulation of the switches on the board I carried with me was barely more complex than turning on the lights.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This was simultaneously the signal for the ark to set sail.Vibrating from the blasts, the ship would be cut off from the outside world in an instant, and a siren would sound the alarm, calling all hands to their posts.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And then, for however long, this would be all that remained of the world.At first I hesitated over where to set the explosives.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I thought the bigger the ship’s tonnage, the better.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Eight years before, when the stone-quarrying companies ceased operations, they had sealed off all mine shafts and tunnels, according to regulations.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The city council and government offices alike were of the official view that no aperture remained.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"True, apart from this passage to the tangerine grove, and the one leading to the boiler room of the city hall, there were no apertures large enough for a person to squeeze though.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But a nuclear bomb is a different matter.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No opening, however small, can be safely overlooked.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Unfortunately, my investigations showed that the entire quarry was riddled with holes—apertures for wiring, plumbing, water supply, ventilation, and so on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The more I checked, the more I found.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The only thing to do was to alter my approach.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If I couldn’t cut off the mountain from an outer world contaminated by radiation or radioactive substances, the only recourse was to abandon the bulk of the mountain that was vulnerable.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I decided to set dynamite in those places that seemed most likely to cave in.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Pulverized rock would make an excellent filter.Of course, being neither a geologist nor a civil engineer, I can’t say exactly what will happen in the blasts.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All I know is what area I think will withstand them safely.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Starting with the work hold in the middle, it should be safe as far as the second hold out from there.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I can’t offer a professional guarantee, but I am sure it’s more than wishful thinking.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Waterstone, as its name implies, is highly compatible with water; as its moisture content increases, its characteristic green grows deeper and it becomes harder, stronger, and so fine-grained that it polishes to a high luster.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I settled on the present work hold as the heart of the ark by taking into account the distribution of that hue.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For the rest of it, people will just have to take my word.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Should the explosions set off a chain reaction that ultimately destroys the ark, so be it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The important thing, after all, is not really survival per se, but the ability to go on hoping, even in one’s final moments.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And we would certainly be guaranteed a gigantic tomb, at least the size of the pyramids!“The going gets tricky here.”Piles of stones blocked the way—pieces of rubble great and small, less hewn than smashed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Some were heaped up like cairns built to guide the souls of dead children to paradise.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The tunnel ended there.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Beyond was a steep cliff, thirty-five feet down or more.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In my mind this was the boundary.“Shall we take a leak?” he asked.“Might as well.”He seemed fairly tense, now that we were about to plunge into enemy territory.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After all that beer, it was hardly surprising that he should want to relieve himself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Side by side, we urinated across the heaps of stones, into empty space.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The sound echoed from so far away that I grew uneasy, leaned backward instinctively, and ended up wetting my trousers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The light from my helmet did not reach the bottom.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Heavy fog at the base of the cliff also cut off visibility.“That’s funny.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There wasn’t any fog before.” Setting foot on the top rung of a steel ladder in the left corner on the edge of the precipice, the shill peered fearfully down.“It’s probably caused by the difference in temperature and humidity between the subterranean water and the open air.”“After making sure which way he went, I grabbed the ladder and took off after him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But when I got down there, damned if he hadn’t disappeared.”“I’m telling you, he dove underwater.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There’s probably a tunnel below the surface of the water.”“It couldn’t have been more than ten or fifteen seconds.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I still can’t believe it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There wasn’t any of this fog then, either.”“Well, let’s go down.”“And just what do you intend to do when we get there?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Be honest, Captain.”“Well, I think it’s probably better not to come on too strong—no needless provocation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I know, I know, attack is the best defense, but still I’d prefer to try talking things over.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We could try to reach some sort of compromise, with this river as a boundary between us.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”The shill glanced at his watch, in the light from his miner’s hat.“Eighteen minutes.”“Pardon?”“Since we left, I mean.”“It doesn’t seem that long.”“What are you going to do, Captain?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You suit yourself.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m going back.”“Back where?” I couldn’t grasp what he meant.“Where we came from.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’ll be just over half an hour, round trip.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perfect timing.”“But why?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The river is right down there.”“That was just an excuse.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I don’t really give a shit about it.”“Well, I still think it’s worth investigating.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If we look around, we might even find some wet footprints.”“Nah, that ladder is too risky.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s not worth it.”“You’re the one who started this.”“I told you—it was an excuse.”“For what?”“Look, I’m not crazy enough to go picking a fight with some guy when I don’t even know if he’s an enemy or a friend.” He glanced at his watch again, and kicked the dirt like someone getting ready for a foot race.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“But I’ll tell you this: whoever underestimates me is going to live to regret it.” He went even faster on the return trip.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I tried to call out to him, but I was gasping for breath, and it was all I could do to keep up with him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I couldn’t understand.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Who was he accusing of underestimating him?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer was drunk and asleep, and I couldn’t recall any particularly stormy exchanges between them.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But there wasn’t anybody else.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I had the feeling that cancer wasn’t the only shadow hanging over him.He did not stop until he reached the firing range.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had no intention of asking questions, but even so he fitted an arrow into the crossbow, drew the bow full, spun around and took aim at my feet.“From here on, don’t utter a sound.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Better take off your shoes too.”“Komono was drunk, you know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can’t believe he was only pretending to be asleep.”“I said shut up!”His voice was so charged with electricity that it all but gave off sparks.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I took off my shoes and stuck them in my belt.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I wanted to hold him back, but he gained another big lead on me at the lift.By the time I had lowered myself back onto the floor of the work hold, he was way across the room.I tiptoed into the last tunnel.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I had no great mind to stick up for the insect dealer.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In a sense, he had it coming.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His overbearing ways—especially his overly familiar way with the girl—had riled me too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But the shill was not a terribly good shot.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Whether the girl was on the top or the bottom, he might err and hit her instead.Even if he did hit his target, things would be sticky.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Calling an ambulance would be bad enough; once the police were called in, the ship was doomed even before its launching.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perhaps a mortal wound would be better.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Once the body was chopped up and flushed down the toilet, nothing would remain but a lingering unpleasantness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And in six more months (following the worst-case scenario), burdened now with two cancer-ridden corpses, I would go back to being a lonely captain, probably never recovering sufficiently to seek other buyers for the tickets to survival.The shill was standing stock-still in the tunnel entranceway, weapon poised.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The arrow was still fixed in place, with no sign that he had fired.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Below the bridge, the blue-and-red-striped sleeping bag was rolled up like a potato bug, and from it emerged deep snores.The shill put his weapon on safety and smiled awkwardly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I have a feeling .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll bet those old geezers in the Broom Brigade are planning an attack for right around tonight.”“What makes you say that?”“Just a feeling I have.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Anyway, Komono should be ashamed of himself—knocked out flat by a few beers!” 15THE MEMBERS OF THE OLYMPICPREVENTION LEAGUE WEARPIG BADGES ON THEIR CHESTSThe girl too lay asleep, face down on the chaise longue, with a light blanket pulled up over her head (by which I do not mean to suggest that the lower half of her body was exposed), her snores rivaling those of the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The shill sat down in the middle of the stairs and wiped the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He said:“I wasn’t really going to shoot.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s the honest truth.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even if the worst possible thing was happening right before my eyes, I wouldn’t have pulled the trigger.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m not as tough as I look and talk, really; it’s all an act.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m just a failure.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And I go into jealous fits over her.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Even though in six months she’ll never belong to anyone again.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She’s something, isn’t she?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I mean, don’t you think so?”“Yes, I do.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I have from the first.”“Back when I was with the gangsters, I happened to read Darwin’s theory of evolution.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In comic book form—but still, it changed my whole view of life.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Yakuza pride themselves on living dangerously, but you know, if their fights are real, so are everybody else’s.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If a gangster is somebody who lays his life on the line every day, then everybody’s a gangster.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But gangsters can see only their own little world.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Life is reduced to a bunch of fights over territory.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You wouldn’t believe how spiteful they are.”“So the problem is who the ‘fittest’ are.”“Exactly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Basically, everyone who’s alive is fit.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Suppose Komono were to try to take her pants off and succeed—he’d be one of the fittest.”“Everything seems so clear to you.”“Not really.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s just evolutionary theory.”“Speaking of fights over territories—the eupcaccia has a very small territory, doesn’t it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Barely the length of its own body.” His mind continued on its own track.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Religions aren’t fair,” he said, “with their heavens and hells.”I laughed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I’m starting to see what you meant when you said a shipload of respectable people would be dull as hell.”“Absolutely.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This is no Olympic village.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No point in gathering a lot of clean-cut athletic types.”“Speaking of the Olympics—did you ever hear of something called the Olympic Prevention League?” He didn’t answer, and I dropped the subject.The coffee was ready.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I placed two cups side by side on the edge of the toilet, and poured out coffee that looked like watery brown paint.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill propped up the insect dealer and held a cup of scalding coffee to his mouth.“All right, Komono, wake up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s only nine-thirty.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve got to talk to you, so wake up.”Opening one bloodshot eye, the insect dealer slurped a mouthful of coffee, made sure he was holding the gun, shook his head, and went back to sleep without uttering a word.The shill and I went back up the stairs, and sat drinking our coffee and waiting for something to happen.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Yawning without opening his mouth, he said, “I wonder if they’re really going to attack.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What do you think, Captain?”“Shall I try again to get hold of Sengoku?”“Why?”“Based on circumstantial evidence, he’s a strong suspect, isn’t he?”“Why are they all old men in that outfit?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Aren’t there any old ladies?”“Apparently not, although I don’t know why.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Maybe the old ladies are too in touch with reality.”Too much coffee upsets my stomach.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Thinking I’d boil myself an egg, I headed for the galley, when out of the corner of my eye I glimpsed a human figure lurking around the tunnel entrance.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I set down my coffee cup, snatched the converted Uzi out of the insect dealer’s sleeping bag, and took off.“What is it?”“There’s somebody over there.”The shill jumped down the stairs in a single bound, quickly overtaking me and running on ahead.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As he planted himself in the entrance to the work hold, crossbow at the ready, he looked reassuringly strong and reliable.“Nobody in sight.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There wasn’t enough time to climb the shaft; maybe he got out that way.” He snapped his fingers in the direction of the tunnel leading to the second hold (the future residential area).“Impossible.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s a dead end, and besides—” I caught myself.That’s right, the shill still didn’t know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I took a step forward, held out the barrel of the Uzi, and waved it up and down.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A bell rang.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I turned off the switch under the rails.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I tested it before too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The warning system is all in working order.”“That’s funny.”“Maybe I only imagined it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The same thing’s happened before, more than once.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This place is so big and empty, and the light is so dim, that even a piece of dust in your eye can look like all sorts of things.”“Are you telling me I only imagined what I saw?”“I didn’t say that.”“It’s not impossible, though.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ve never lived anywhere as big as this.”“But if you caught sight of him repeatedly .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I mean, if it was an optical illusion you’d have seen him once, period.”“I suppose so.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You want to have a look in that pile of stuff over there?”The shill aimed his crossbow at the palisade of old bikes concealing the entrance to the storerooms.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The bike handles were turned at odd angles, with no sign that anyone had been through.Whoever knew about the camouflage would also know that inside was a dead end.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If he meant to use the arsenal, however, that was different.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In that case, there was even the possibility of counterattack.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I cocked my Uzi and held it ready.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Lining up the handlebars in the right and left corners so they faced the same way, I swung the palisade out and switched on the lights.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"While the shill guarded the entrance, I checked out the interior, step by step.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Nobody was there.“My nerves were getting to me, I guess,” I apologized.“You’re not the only one.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I made a damned fool out of myself.” The shill ran his fingers lightly along the barrel of my Uzi.“Aha, so this was no toy after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Now I see why it attracted Komono, with his eye for guns.”“It’s converted.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you go easy on the gunpowder, you can use it as a semiautomatic.”“Put it on safety, please.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Things like that have a way of causing more trouble than they’re worth.”“Komono says a crossbow isn’t much use against more than one enemy, since you can’t fire in volleys.”“Have all the guns in here been converted?”“Yes, more or less.”“I’ll be damned.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’ve got yourself enough for a small army.”He sat back in the chair in the lowest armory and looked around excitedly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’d spoken like a pacifist a moment before, but now that he found himself surrounded by weapons, it seemed to set his blood racing after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was certainly true that guns could be the source of much trouble.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I kept them to use against rats, snakes, and stray dogs; to date, I had exterminated seven rats and one cat.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For protection against human invaders, I had greater faith in dynamite.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the end, man-made cave-ins would protect us like the door to a safe.“I’ll go get the sleeping bags,” I said.“Wait a minute.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This is where we are now, right?” The moment he set eyes on the wall map, he was absorbed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When I came back lugging two new sleeping bags, he was tearing off strips of red vinyl tape and sticking them on the map, like some big chief of staff.“Here, and here—see, the enemy has to cross at least three barriers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Especially climbing down the shaft here, they’ve got to go single file with their backs turned toward us.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’d be a cinch to wipe ’em out.”“As long as they didn’t attack while we were sleeping.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This one with the yellow stripes is a medium.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You can have it.”“Looks like we’d better have sentry duty tonight, anyway.” We went back under the bridge and laid out the sleeping bags, with the insect dealer at the far end, me by the stairs, and the shill in the middle.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My brain felt suddenly exhausted, as if somebody had kneaded it in flour.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Without asking, the shill helped himself to a beer from the refrigerator.“If the free drinks go on forever, that only reduces their value,” I said.“Is that a nice thing to say?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Of course I expect you to bill me for anything I eat or drink.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s a fundamental rule of community life, isn’t it?—pay for what you consume.”“About the night watch—you and I are the only ones awake.”“I know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Funny, isn’t it?” He opened the can and lowered his mouth to it as carefully as if it contained hot soup.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Get a load of Watermelon Head here, sleeping like a pig.”“Watch your language.” My voice went shrill despite myself.“I didn’t mean anything by it.” He smiled apologetically, then quickly straightened his face and said, “After all, if I really thought so I’d never say so, right?”“You shouldn’t look down on pigs.” I took off my shoes, tore the label off the brand-new sleeping bag, unzipped it, and stretched out inside, propping myself up on my elbow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Sure, they’re stupid.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
At least as stupid as people.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But what’s really stupid is to go around thinking pigs are inferior to people.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ve already told this to Komono too: I’m not having any muscle-worshipping types share this ship with me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s going to be a long trip.”“All right.”“Do you know what mark the Olympic Prevention League chose as their symbol?”“No—what?”“A pig.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A round green pig, like a ball with legs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Olympic Prevention League members wear the badges on their chests.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You may have seen them—round green badges trimmed in silver.When they march in demonstrations, the members carry a flag with the same design.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just so no one will think it’s an ad for pork cutlets, the mouth is slightly open, with tusks bared.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"OPL is still a tiny fringe movement, but I hear people with that badge are scattered all across the country, and all around the world.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Most are obese, or at least fairly overweight.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Which Olympics was it, now .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"remember, on the TV news?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Members of the Olympic Prevention League marched boldly onto the playing field, waving their flags.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I remember I felt a little bit sympathetic to their aims, but also a little put off, a little embarrassed, actually.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The slogans began pouring in from hand mikes:“ ‘Down with muscle-worship!’“ ‘Down with vitamins!’“ ‘Down with the national flag!’”.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They wanted to pull down all the national flags on display overhead.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It certainly is true that that cluster of national flags in the Olympic stadium is presumptuous.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
People are all too ready to pick sides for no good reason.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Showing the national flag only takes advantage of that inborn weakness.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And why should any country get excited about a well-developed set of muscles?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s unnatural.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There’s got to be some plot.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, to raise the national flag and play the national anthem in honor of robust bodies constitutes a clear act of discrimination against the rest of the citizenry.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There in that sports arena being used openly as a ceremonial hall to exalt national prestige, it was only natural for the pig group to launch an attack on the flags, and for the steering committee to take the defensive.Grounds keepers ran around blowing police whistles.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Angry at having the games interrupted, the spectators began throwing things: hamburgersboxed lunches tin cansspectacles strings tissue paper false teethcondoms chewing gumNext the players and guards together attacked the league members.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The announcer issued earnest appeals, as if gargling in sand:“Players, please return to your assigned positions and stand by.The games will resume momentarily.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Spectators are requested to wait quietly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The lavatories are presently all occupied.” But by then it was impossible to stanch the flow of waste articles that came pouring down the bleachers like lava.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The conical stadium was soon buried in trash, and some of the judges announced they were leaving.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The players became more and more crazed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not content merely with ripping the prevention league pigs apart, they consigned the officials to oblivion and then advanced against the spectators.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A sports commentator offered his analysis: “If things go on this way it will be a darned shame for the athletes.” Finally the whole stadium swelled up like bowels with the anus sutured shut, in the shape of a giant toilet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It also bore some resemblance to a dirigible with the back hollowed out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
At any moment it would lift off tearing away from its anchor and go scudding over the seas where a hundred tropical low-pressure zones clustered.Better split before they come checking tickets.Everybody knows they were pork cutlet restaurant owners in disguise.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
[And they all livedhappily ever after.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"]“H E Y, Captain, isn’t there any TV here?”I awoke at the shill’s voice.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had a feeling we had had some sort of run-in over hogs, but I could not tell exactly where that had left off and my dream had taken over.“Forget it.”“Darn.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s almost time for my favorite show.”“Look, TV isn’t going to be around forever.”“Don’t you get bored?”“I just take a trip somewhere if I do: with three-D aerial-photograph maps, I can fly anywhere I want.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Want to take a look?”“That’s okay, I’m not in the mood.”The shill gave a huge yawn, fell on his sleeping bag, and wiped tears from his eyes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At last, for the first time in hours, it was back: silence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The walls of the underground quarry sighed as if they knew my feelings.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
CCCCCCcccccccchhhhhh.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
a silent mutter as of grass seeds bursting open.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Until now these walls had seemed a second skin to me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They had seemed the inner walls of my own bowels, turned inside out for my contemplation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Now that special intimacy was gone forever.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Community life meant that they must appear the same to all.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The walls were ordinary walls, the floors ordinary floors, the ceilings ordinary ceilings.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I would have to refrain from talking out loud to no one but the stone; from singing crazily off key till I was covered in sweat; from dancing ecstatically in the nude.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Yes, everything had changed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even if I could somehow have chased away the shill and the insect dealer, the old tranquillity would never return.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Someone was watching me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even if what I saw had been an illusion, the figment the shill had spotted and chased had at least a ninety percent chance of being real.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How else could I explain the way my traps had been tinkered with?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even if the mysterious interloper was Sengoku, it would mean that he not only knew about the secret toilet and the alarm system but also had been listening in on my monologues and songs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The mere thought made every mucous membrane in my body feel soaked in tannin.Until I could devise a definite counterplan, there seemed no choice but to keep watch, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As I was thinking this, the shill suddenly began to snore.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He was fast asleep without any pillow at all, let alone one wrapped in an old undershirt.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Now I was the only one awake.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That saved the trouble of drawing lots to see who went first.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was angry, but I didn’t feel like forcing either of them to wake up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Collecting the crossbow and the Uzi, I headed for the galley to do what I always did when I couldn’t sleep: sit on the toilet and munch on chocolates, washing them down with beer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I might have a good look now at my eupcaccia too.But the focus of my interest turned from there up the stone steps to the top of the bridge.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Unreal images began to proliferate.The girl lay asleep now, her whole body pressed tightly against the chaise longue, which was permeated with the smells of my body.Her body nestled in the very curves hollowed out by mine.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perhaps in her dream she was even now smelling my smells.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The chaise longue was embracing her bare flesh in my stead.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She must be receiving some sort of signal in her dream; if she had normal reception capability, at any moment now she would arise.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And then in fact she did get up and cross over the bridge toward me.She peered down from the end of the parapet, leaned her chin on her hand, and waggled the fingers.“Captain, something’s making a funny noise in the lockers.”“Ssh.”From the waist up she was wrapped in terry cloth the color of a dried leaf; from the waist down she might very well be nude.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A T-shirt had been her only upper garment, so it was entirely possible.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Pointing to the two men fast asleep in their sleeping bags, I made an exaggerated show of discomfiture, acting as if she and I were accomplices.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She waved back.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Could she be thinking what I was thinking?“I think it’s locker number three.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Can you hear?”“It’s probably someone trying to reach me on the wireless.” At any rate, I was lucky to be able to respond to this new development by myself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Holding the crossbow in my left hand, the Uzi in my right, I climbed the stairs with slow steps.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sniffing, I wondered what it would feel like to slap her bottom on the bare skin, without any skirt in between.16THIS IS MOLE.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
OVER.—Mole here.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Sengoku here.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This is an emergency.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Can you talk now?Have you got time?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—What do you mean, have I got time?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ve been looking all over for you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—I’ve got to see you and talk to you in person.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s very important.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Relax, will you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Stop exaggerating.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—It’s about the Broom Brigade.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But I can’t risk having anyone listen in.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—I’ve already checked to see if anyone’s on this channel.Over.—There’s a body.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They want me to get rid of it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can’t have anyone listening in.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—A body, did you say?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Whose?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Anyone I know?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Do they know who the murderer is?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Meet me somewhere and I’ll tell you all about it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.The girl whispered in my ear: “Don’t let yourself become an accessory to crime.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It could be a trap.”I was perched on the armrest of the chaise longue.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She was seated with knees raised, shoulder against the same armrest.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If I so much as turned my head and looked down, our eyes would meet at close range.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The voice kept calling.—Hello, hello, manhole manager, please come in.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Is there someone there with you?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.The girl smiled and stuck out her tongue.—You know perfectly well there isn’t.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Anyway, it’s not such a bad idea, is it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Considering the nature of the item, I think we could probably charge a fairly exorbitant amount.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Of course the Broom Brigade wants to open direct negotiations, but I knew you wouldn’t like that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I explained that you’re something of a recluse, and they finally accepted that.But if you don’t cooperate, they’re going to send their representative charging over there.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Who’s that?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not my dear old dad, I hope.—Just meet me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Although he isn’t as bad as you make him out to be.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—You keep your opinions to yourself.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Now the son of a bitch has taken up murder, is that it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Nobody said that.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—I can’t trust you if you’re going to stand up for him, Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—All I’m doing is carrying on hardheaded diplomacy, as secretary-general of SWAMDI.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m completely neutral.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Stop being such a goddamn mole, will you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—You’d better have a barbecue or something before that body starts going bad on you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—That’s not as safe as you might think.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’d better talk it over with Inototsu.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He’s got lots of ideas.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Look, now’s the time to forget the past and be reunited, father and son.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s been five years.Listen to the advice of a friend.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—I’m disappointed in you, Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was going to give you a key to this place.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You probably don’t know what that means—then again, maybe you do.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A key so you could come and go freely.But now I’ll have to think again.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That rat who was running around getting into everything was probably you, anyway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.“Don’t.” This time it was the girl’s turn to slap me on the bottom.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You mustn’t show your hand.”—There seems to be some misunderstanding.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Having both you and Inototsu look on me with suspicion puts me in a very difficult position.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—I have nothing to discuss with you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over and out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
QRT.—Wait.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He’s not the type to let anything drop.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m afraid of him myself.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, if this new deal works out, I think he’ll reconsider about the shipments of hexavalent chromium too.Over.—No comment.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
QRT.—Just the other day he grabbed a pushy junior high school student and crushed his fingers in a pair of pliers.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The guy figured Inototsu was just bluffing, so he paid no attention—and damned if Inototsu didn’t go ahead and do it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Crush, crunch.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You should have heard the poor guy scream.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—QRT.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"QRT.—Mole, you’re stubborn.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you change your mind, get in touch with me again right away.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll be waiting.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"QRT.As I returned the apparatus to the locker, the girl asked curiously, “What does that mean, ‘QRT’?”“It’s an expression used by ham radio operators.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It means‘communication ended.’ ”“Really?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How funny.”“I feel terrible.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Bad aftertaste.”“That was amazing,” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Crushing someone’s fingers in pliers!,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There really are people like that.”“Sengoku’s no angel, either.”“You were too open with him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll bet Komono would have handled him more shrewdly.”“I bought his sweet-potato cakes every day for over six months; I’m his best customer.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not only that, I paid him a straight twenty percent commission on the hexavalent chromium business.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”“What are you going to do?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you don’t do something, he said they’ll come charging in here.”“They’re trying to scare me with that talk about a dead body.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Who could it be?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Do they mean to drag me into it so they can implicate me in the murder?”“There’s no point in wasting time worrying.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The best thing to do is tell the others about it and see what they say.”“It won’t work.”“Decide that after you’ve talked it over with them.”“I just wasn’t cut out to be the leader of a group like this.”“Now now, there’s only four of us.”“Do you know the three basic conditions necessary for survival in a nuclear shelter?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"First is waste disposal, second is ventilation and temperature control, and third is management.”“Wait,” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Before you wake them up, let me go to the toilet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The noise of flushing it will probably wake them all up, anyway.”Was she seriously thinking of straddling that seat wearing nothing but a terry-cloth blanket?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Impossible; too indecent.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Surely she would put on some clothes first.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Here, right in front of me, she would stand in her panties and step into the red artificial leather skirt; then, nude from the waist up, she would pass her arms through the sleeves of that T-shirt with the palm trees on the front.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I could gaze at close range on her underarm stubble and the shape of her navel.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Finally I too would be able to share a moment of casual intimacy with a woman.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All because I had built the ark.Or was I only a pig to her—no one to be shy around?The blanket arched through the air, landing on the chaise longue.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Unfortunately, she was fully dressed, wearing both skirt and T-shirt.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’d half expected as much.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Still, I couldn’t help feeling the wistful pang of a child deprived of a longed-for treat.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After she was gone, the terry-cloth blanket remained where it had fallen, folded in half and twisted in a doughnut shape .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
the shape of eupcaccia dung.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Falling on my knees, I buried my face in it, breathing its odor of moldy bread.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That was the blanket’s odor, not hers.The sound of urination, like an unsteady arc drawn with trembling hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The sound of paper being torn.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then the roar of flushing: water and air engaged in mutual attack, plummeting simultaneously.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I regretted my failure to ask her name.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And who, I wondered, was the real cancer patient—him or her?After a time, there came the sleepy, cheerful laughter of the men, evidently teasing her about something.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With me not there, they seemed to feel liberated.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I myself grew weary of my gloomy personality; and yet when I was alone I’d often managed to feel quite gay.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Singing, laughing, acting out solo dramas with only the stone walls for audience .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

".“Captain,” called the voice of the insect dealer, still thick with drowsiness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“So you heard from them, did you?”“Come on down, I’ll make some coffee.” The girl’s too-innocent voice continued, and at last I raised my face from the towel.“Looks like we’d better be prepared to stay up all night,” said the shill with a yawn.Doing what one wants to do, and refusing what one doesn’t want to do, seem alike, but are in fact utterly different.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I didn’t want to meet anyone’s eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Holding the converted gun, I sat on the third step.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The girl was at the sink, measuring out ground coffee.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill was seated on the john, rubbing sleep out of his eyes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer was sitting up in his sleeping bag, waving a lighted cigarette over his head.“This one puts me over my quota for the day,” he said.“Somehow I feel as if I’ve been dreaming a long dream.”“I don’t know—however great the water pressure may be, could you really flush a human body down this hole?” The shill stared down between his legs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It is a human body, I assume.”“It must be.” She switched on the coffeepot and wiped her hands on the shill’s shirt.“I did flush a dead cat down there once,” I said, and purposely held my hands wide apart, exaggerating its size.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“One this big, a tortoiseshell.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It just popped right down.”“A human body isn’t the same as a cat.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The head alone is huge.” The insect dealer inhaled deeply on his cigarette and blew the smoke out slowly through his nostrils, as if loath to part with it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It can’t get through anyplace narrower than the head.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s how they space the bars in animal cages, did you know that?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
By matching the spaces to the size of the animal’s head.”“Stop it—how sickening!” The girl seemed genuinely angry.“Do you intend to go through with it?”“Certainly not.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s the last sort of thing I’d want to get mixed up with.”“In that case, why didn’t you come out and say so before?You sound so wishy-washy that you end by giving them an excuse.”“An excuse for what?” asked the shill.“Well, Sengoku said that if the captain wouldn’t enter into negotiations, they’d storm the place.”“Starting to talk tough, eh?” The insect dealer snuffed out his cigarette on the sole of his shoe.“They’ll come in here over my dead body,” I declared.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I don’t even want to talk to Inototsu.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Let me make one thing clear: as long as I’m captain of this ship, he will never, ever, have boarding privileges.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even if I could fit the entire population of the world in here, I’d still keep him out in the cold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For me, survival means one thing: having him die.”“I can appreciate how you feel .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

but how are you going to turn him back if he does come on board?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Maybe you could if he was alone, but he’s apt to come with his entire entourage.”“In other words, the captain’s stymied.” The shill took off one shoe and began to massage the arch of his foot.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Which means it’s our turn now.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All we have to do is go to the bargaining table in his place.”“That’s right.” The girl poured coffee into the cups.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“After all, Inototsu is using that Sengoku person as his representative.There’s no reason why the captain should have to handle this in person.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Come get your coffee.”“He’s got his representative, you’ve got yours.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What could be more fair?” The shill took his cup and without warning dealt the girl’s left cheek a sudden hard slap.“Ow!” she screamed, raising a hand to her cheek.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then she held out her hands like a magician, and smiled.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Didn’t hurt a bit.”“A little trick I learned.” The shill passed a cup to the insect dealer and nodded.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You fit the hollow of your hand perfectly against the curve of the cheek, and make the air explode.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It makes a terrific noise, with practically no pain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Perfect for making it appear you’ve bad a falling-out with your companion, and confusing the other side.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Works like a charm.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What do you say, isn’t that quite a trick?”“It is indeed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Thanks to you, I’m wide awake.” The insect dealer finished polishing his glasses and put them on, reseating himself on top of his sleeping bag.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If you agree, Captain, he and I will take over the negotiations.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A charlatan and a shill—now there’s a combination for you.”“One practices deception, and the other’s taken in by it.Perfect.” She held out a coffee cup and peered up at me through her lashes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Since I was above her, she could hardly do otherwise, but I deliberately chose to read a hidden meaning into her look.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If the insect dealer and the shill went out together, she and I would be alone.“Sure,” I said, “go ahead if you want.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s okay with me.” I descended the steps and accepted a cup of coffee.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The touch of her fingertips was like cold bean curd.“But he’s no pushover,” I warned.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Logic doesn’t get through to him.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, you talk about ‘negotiations,’ but my position is non-negotiable.”The girl gave me a swift wink.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I broke off.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Blowing on her coffee to cool it, she said:“Now that you’re awake, Komono, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That bug called the eupcaccia—it moves around in a circle with its head facing the sun, while feeding on its own eliminations, isn’t that right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So when it’s dark and it goes to sleep, it’s facing west.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Right?”“I suppose so,” answered the insect dealer without enthusiasm.“Then that’s strange.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What happens when it wakes up the next morning?”“You’re asking me?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Ask the captain.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He bought one, he must know.”“Actually I never gave it any thought,” I said, “but now that you mention it, it is strange.”“Not really.” The insect dealer put his glasses in the steam rising from his cup, clouding them on purpose.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Just use your head.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A clock doesn’t have to have a twelve-hour dial.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There are such things as clocks with twenty-four-hour dials.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I saw one once”“But doesn’t its head always point to the sun?”“All it has to do is push against its dung and turn a half-circle.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It all fits.”“Brilliant.” The girl laughed, and pressed against the coffee cup, rippling the surface of the coffee.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You could make anything sound plausible.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And it all comes off the top of your head—I really have to hand it to you!”“Well, I’m afraid I can’t be much of an optimist,” I said gloomily.“Don’t worry,” said the shill, and slurped his coffee noisily.“That’s right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My guiding principle,” said the insect dealer,“is to think first, last, and always of your viewpoint, Captain.You’ve asked for our assistance, and we won’t let you down.”“But this request for negotiations could be just an excuse for a skirmish, couldn’t it?” I said.“As a former SDF man, what do you say, Komono?” One eye on my Uzi, the shill kept going through the motions of pulling the trigger.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Could we defend ourselves if we had to?”“Well, the enemy is a bunch of old men, and amateurs to boot.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Structurally this place would make a good stronghold .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".and besides, you’ve got five crossbows, and seven remodeled guns, right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Pretty good fighting power.”There was an intermittent buzz—a call on the radio.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All four of us stood up at once and raced to the stairs, the shill in the lead, with the insect dealer holding the girl’s hand and me pushing her by the hips (there was no need to do so, but somehow it made me feel better).The voice that came out of the radio receiver sounded like an elephant with a cold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This time it was not Sengoku, but Inototsu.17SURVIVAL GAME—Hello, son, how’re you doing?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s been a long time.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This is your dad.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—You’ve got one hell of a nerve.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I have nothing to say to you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Period.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over and out.—Wait.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Let’s bury the past.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We’re both grown men.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Impossible.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over and out.—Listen, this is a deal you can’t afford to pass up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Over and out, over and out.—Listen, will you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They’re onto me.Suddenly the shill gripped my wrist.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My fingers opened and the microphone dropped, to be passed to the insect dealer’s waiting hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He shouldered his way up, pushing against my chest and forcing me out of the front position.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That loss was more than made up for by the fact that my buttocks now pressed squarely against the girl’s abdomen.—Hello, please continue.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This is the captain’s representative.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Who the hell are you?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—The name’s Komono.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m the captain’s liaison man.Please state your business.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Liaison, huh?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s a good one.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Suppose you tell me what you really do.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—I sell educational materials.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Insect specimens, that sort of thing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Now let’s get straight to the point—who is onto you, and why?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—You’re quite a character.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m talking about the body, of course.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Yes, I understand you have some problem about a dead body.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Exactly what kind of body would this be—homicide, or accidental death, or what?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—How am I supposed to know?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Ask my son.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Stop playing games.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What’s that supposed to mean?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Just what I said.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This is a body you people abandoned, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.“You’re crazy!” I yelled.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I don’t know a goddamn thing about any dead body!” The radio was one-way, not adapted for integrated conversation; as long as the other person didn’t push the right button, your voice wouldn’t get through.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Knowing this, I still yelled out, in reflex.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer patted me quickly on the shoulder to shush me up, and the girl pressed harder against my buttocks.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Inototsu’s voice continued, oblivious.—Of course I have no hard evidence to prove it, but there’s circumstantial evidence galore.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If this gets out, it’s going to be rather awkward.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You see, my garbage collection business is a responsible social service organization: any illegally discarded objects we come across, we have a legal obligation to turn in to the authorities.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But I’m willing to be flexible.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Why not settle this just between ourselves?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My son is still there, isn’t he?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You tell him not to be so stubborn.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Children never understand their parents’feelings.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Son, can you hear me?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I think you’ve got a very worthwhile enterprise there, and I want you to know I’m supporting you one hundred percent behind the scenes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I certainly don’t want to put you in a compromising situation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I think we can work together, help each other out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.The shill called loudly from beside the mike.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“What do you mean by a ‘worthwhile enterprise’?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Garbage collection?”—Save your breath.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I know all about it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’ve got a nuclear bomb shelter, right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A very promising venture.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Shows great foresight.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can’t go into all the details now—that’ll have to wait till we can get together—but I’m already making some moves on my own.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Signing up members.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My roster has some pretty impressive names on it too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You see, I think I can help you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".“It is a threat,” whispered the girl, her breath brushing the back of my earlobe.“That dead body is a trick of some kind too, you can bet on it,” said the insect dealer.The shill bit his lip.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Looks like he’s one jump ahead of us.” Inototsu continued talking, aware of these interpolations.—You’d really be surprised.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Why, I’ve got city officials, the director of a credit union, two doctors at the city hospital—even the president of Hishitomi Storage has signed a contract.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Very promising, this little venture—it could really go places.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’re not going to let a little thing like a body or two cramp your style, are you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s all I have to say.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.Leaving the radio switched to reception, the insect dealer stuck out his jaw, teeth clenched, and said, “Captain, are you positive you know nothing about that body?”“Of course I am,” I answered.Without even waiting for me to finish, the shill grabbed the microphone out of the insect dealer’s hands and pushed the switch to transmission.—Would you mind telling us the victim’s age and cause of death?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—You’re new.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What’s your department?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—I’m the purser.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
In charge of passengers’ quarters.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Cute.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To answer your question, I’m no pathologist, so I haven’t any idea.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Aren’t you the ones with that information?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—That’s a leading question.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No fair.The shill switched off the radio and looked hard at me.“Couldn’t one of those old men have wandered in and got caught in a trap?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Say he got temporarily blinded, and staggered off that cliff.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”“But the traps were all tampered with.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Knocked out.Remember?”“Whoever it was might have started doing that after he had already met with some sort of accident.”“I doubt it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Spray plastic takes a long time to harden that way.”“As far as that goes, the body may not be fresh, either,” put in the insect dealer.The buzzer sounded, urging the resumption of communication.“Maybe it’s that guy I chased before.” The shill snapped his fingers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Maybe he fell in the water and drowned.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Wait a minute—that’s it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I bet it’s that fellow Sengoku.”“No, it couldn’t be him,” said the girl, her breath again tickling my earlobe.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The captain talked to him on the radio while you were both asleep.”“In that case, this body could be very fresh indeed,” said the insect dealer, and slowly took back the transmitter, with an air of grim determination.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“The murder could have taken place after that conversation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even now, by rights, it ought to be the sweet-potato man we were talking to.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Inototsu must know the captain hates his guts.”The buzzer kept squawking impatiently.“That’s right,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Now that you say so, it is odd—because the other transmitter is in Sengoku’s store.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s strange for Inototsu to be talking on it.”“That’s peculiar,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He licked his lips and swallowed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Then was the sweet-potato man given the job of disposing of his own corpse?”The insect dealer flicked the transmitter on.—Wait a minute, please.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We’re having a consultation.He turned the switch back off and said, “Supposing the sweet-potato man was killed at his store.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Circumstantial evidence could very well point to the captain as prime suspect.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But what motive could there be?”“None—seeing as how I didn’t do it!” I retorted.“I mean Inototsu’s motive.”“There’s no point in thinking about it,” said the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You don’t even know for sure that the sweet-potato man was the victim.” Her hand rested lightly on my shoulder.Instantly her opinion struck me as unassailable truth.“Check it out,” I commanded the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Ask to speak to Sengoku.”Nodding, he flicked the transmitter back on.—Come in.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Sorry to keep you waiting.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Would you mind putting the sweet-potato man on the line?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Thanks.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—He’s gone out, but I can leave him a message.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—What do you mean?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’re in his store, aren’t you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—No, I’m in the office over by the tangerine grove.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There’s a radio transmitter here too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Sweet-potato man,” eh?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s a good one.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Suits him, all right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
[Sounds of whispering.],Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Ah—it seems he’s gone out on his motorcycle to get some cigarettes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He should be right back.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.“Ask him where they found the body,” prompted the shill.—Where’d you find the body?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—As if you didn’t know.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over here, by the tangerine grove entrance, of course.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you won’t get rid of it for me, I’ll have no choice but to go to the police.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In which case, like it or not, the entire quarry will be the focus of a police investigation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’d like to avoid that as much as you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Put my son back on the line, would you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I assume he’s still there, listening.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s high time we had a reconciliation, son.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’ve got the wrong idea about me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If it’s the way I punished you when you were a kid that bothers you, I want you to know that I did it solely out of fatherly love.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If that incident had ended up in family court, the shame would have followed you for the rest of your life.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then and now, I have only your best interests at heart.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’re there, aren’t you, son?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Try to understand.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And as for that business about trampling my wife to death, it’s a damned lie.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What do you say, shall we make a deal?We are father and son, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Let’s team up and do something really big.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, I’ve changed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Mellowed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And I’m not getting any younger.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.Shoving my way between the insect dealer and the shill, I stuck my face up to the transmitter and yelled:—Quit the father-son baloney.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It gives me the willies!—I can’t help it, it’s true.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Half of your chromosomes came from my sperm.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Over and out.—Wait.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All I want is a little bit of happiness in my old age.The Broom Brigade has made a good reputation for itself, and I’d like to do more for society.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I want to live a useful life.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You see, I have changed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.“Oh, why did that damn body have to butt in like this?” I muttered.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I felt defeated.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It had been a bad day.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Every conceivable contingency had burst on me with the force of a tidal wave.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was enough to make a person believe in Friday the thirteenth, or unlucky days on the Buddhist calendar, or any such baleful influences.The insect dealer drew the microphone close to his mouth and said quietly, in a voice suggesting strong willingness to compromise:—I’m sorry, but could you give us a little more time?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—I hate to repeat myself, but I want to patch things up with my son.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s only human nature.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m human too, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.“What do you think?” The insect dealer switched the set off and sighed.“There really isn’t any choice, is there?” The shill turned toward me, speaking rapidly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Isn’t that right?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you don’t want to get on the wrong side of the Broom Brigade, you’ve got no choice but to go ahead and dispose of that body.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If the real culprit would only turn up, there’d be nothing to fear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s it, we’ve got to come on strong there.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Because if the captain didn’t do it, then the murderer must be one of them.”“Not necessarily,” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I believe the captain too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But that doesn’t guarantee they haven’t tampered with the evidence.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even supposing it’s all fake, if they did a good job we can’t let down our guard.”“Are there really only two entrances to this cave?” asked the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She rested her knee on the chaise longue, thereby shifting her weight so that our bodies were no longer pressed together.“Couldn’t some other outfit be camped out somewhere else in here?”“It’s awfully hard to imagine,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I had no proof to justify ruling it out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With the rapidity of a high-speed printer, I flipped mentally through the surveying maps stored in my memory.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Certainly there were large areas of the cave that I had not yet attempted to map or explore—I had in mind especially those old excavations midway down the eastern cliff, like settings for rock-carved Buddhas.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But no tunnel connected them to the interior.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The ground there was dry, and the quality of the rock poor; presumably they were trial borings that had been summarily abandoned.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To the best of my knowledge, there had been no indications of human comings and goings anywhere, except at the tangerine grove entrance.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I added, “And there’s been absolutely no sign of anything.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“Once you start letting your suspicions grow, there’s no drawing a line,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Based purely on circumstantial evidence, I’m a prime suspect myself.” Covering his mouth, he giggled in a way I found unbecoming and unsavory.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You have only my word that I let some suspicious character get away; there’s no proof.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Maybe I killed him, and I’ve just been putting on an act all this time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Seeing is believing, isn’t it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I think we should go on over and see for ourselves.”“We’ve got to draw the line somewhere.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We’re just groping around in circles.” The insect dealer put the radio back on the shelf, clasped his hands, and cracked his knuckles.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“In a case like this, all the conjecture and speculation in the world won’t get you anywhere.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We’ve got to analyze the situation according to the facts at hand, and map out our strategy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Right?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
At the moment there are two issues facing us.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"One is the handling of the body, if it is a body.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The other is the proposal from the Broom Brigade, or from their leader, Inototsu, concerning management participation.”“Hold on,” I interrupted.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Quit taking the discussion in your own hands, will you?” By the barest fraction of an inch, taking care not to be observed, I nudged closer to the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The difference was so slight that I could not tell for sure whether or not our bodies were again touching.“Don’t worry,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perspiration made his glasses slide down his nose.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“As captain, your word is final; that goes without saying.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was only trying to clarify our situation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In other words, those two issues—the body’s disposal and Inototsu’s proposal—have to be dealt with separately.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Otherwise you play into his hands.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’s trying to use the body as bait for his deal, and you mustn’t fall for it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Isn’t that so?”The buzzer sounded again.“That makes sense.” The girl nodded briskly; the vibrations conveyed themselves to my buttocks.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“They are separate issues.But supposing we turned down his offer of a merger—isn’t it possible that he’d refuse to hand over the body?”“That’s right,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Somehow we’ve got to find his weak spot.” Boldly I edged over another tiny fraction of an inch.“Nothing could be easier,” said the insect dealer, wiping his glasses on the tail of his shirt.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Leave the bargaining to me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My tongue has gotten me through many a tight spot before.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’d be a cinch.”Somehow it had become established that either the insect dealer or the shill, or both, would represent me in the negotiations.I did not fully trust either one of them, and yet it was a welcome development.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For one thing, I doubted my ability to confront Inototsu on an equal basis; for another, if the two of them went away, I’d be alone with the girl.“But it’s so disgusting.” Disgust rolled around on her tongue like a taffy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The toilet won’t be fit to use anymore once we stuff a body down it, will it?”“Don’t worry,” I said, “there’s no blood.” It was a lie.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even when I had flushed away the cat’s body, let alone the aborted fetuses, it had been a while before I could bring myself to come near the toilet again.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Once I forced myself to urinate there, and ended up vomiting.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was four or five days before I could begin fixing meals near there again.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The only reason I was so calm now was that I still didn’t take seriously the existence of this “body.” The buzzer went on screaming at us.“Okay?” The insect dealer looked at each of us in turn.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill and the girl gazed at me.“Okay,” I said, “but I must insist you stick to the matter of the corpse.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Whatever happens, I’m not letting Inototsu on board.” The insect dealer flicked the radio back on.—Hello.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Sorry to keep you waiting.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This is Komono, the liaison man.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Do you read me?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Come in, come in.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What took so long?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—We’ve decided to consider your overture.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But we can’t settle on a fee until we’ve had a look at the body in question, and hear a detailed report about its place of discovery, condition at the time, and so on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Where would you like to meet?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Wait just a minute.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’ve got it all wrong.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m doing you a favor by not reporting to the authorities.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Call off your bluff, Inototsu.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We’ve got this whole conversation on tape from the very beginning.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And as the first person to come upon the dead body, you not only failed to report it to the police but plotted to dispose of it illegally.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Wouldn’t that be a little tough to explain?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.The shill tilted his head and wet his lips.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Did you hear that?He is good, the son of a gun.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll be damned.” Apparently it worked; for no reason, Inototsu began to laugh.—All right, all right—this is no time to quibble.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll meet you anywhere.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll go there, if you want.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s fine with me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ve got a pickup at my disposal right now.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.“No!,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Don’t let him near here!” I said.“Why not?” The insect dealer covered the microphone with his hand.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Aren’t you being a little paranoid?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Of course it s up to you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“He’s got us outnumbered, and the Broom Brigade is a paramilitary force,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“What if they should attack?”“If being outnumbered is the problem, it’s more dangerous for us to go there,” said the shill, adding in a thin wheedle, “If they take us hostage, will you come rescue us, Captain?” The insect dealer spoke into the microphone.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"—Well, that’s the picture.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You heard, didn’t you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Nobody trusts you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Great.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Well, then, how about someplace more neutral?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I know .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Laughter Hill.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Nobody’ll see us there.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Ask my son, he’ll tell you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.“What’s that?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Laughter what?” Leaving the radio switched to reception, the insect dealer turned to ask me.“Hill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Laughter Hill.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s an out-of-the-way place along the coast,” I told him.“Funny name.”“You go south from the station until you come to the Fishermen’s Union warehouse, and then turn.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There’s a sea cave nearby, and depending on which way the wind blows, sometimes it makes a peculiar noise.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Doesn’t sound like laughter so much as it does a sniveling child with a bad cold.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Quite unpleasant.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But some people find it amusing, and laugh themselves silly when they hear it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Geriatric patients fighting off depression take bag lunches to the foot of the hill, and sit there just waiting for the wind to blow.”“How funny!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It makes me laugh just hearing about it.” The girl giggled, and twisted her body in such a way that her abdomen pressed like a softball into my buttocks.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I in turn moved so as to expand our shared space (the area where her flesh melted into mine).,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No adverse reaction.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I felt myself about to forget that I was a pig.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As long as Inototsu stayed away, I didn’t give a damn where the talks were held.“Count me out,” said the shill, flicking the radio off with a fingernail.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Once you get there you’ll find nothing in sight but a dead body, and then all of a sudden the cops—no, thanks.”“You’ve got a point.” The insect dealer switched the radio back on.—Sorry, no go.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
None of us has enough nerve.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The last thing we want is to get there and find nothing in sight but a dead body, and then suddenly have cops crawling all over us.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—What?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Would I play a dirty trick like that?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Don’t be preposterous.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Remember, I’m the one who’s devoted to cleaning up this town.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not just trash and empty cans, either—my real aim is a cleansing of the spirit.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Nowadays it’s essential—purifying the people themselves.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m serious.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I share your concerns from the bottom of my heart, and I want to join hands with you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What can I do to make you believe me?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Tell me this.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’ve already made a fair amount of money from advance ticket sales.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Isn’t that so?—I told you I was recruiting people, in some very influential circles, too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’re welcome to supervise the whole operation, from members’ roster to accounts.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.“He’s crazy,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“When it comes time for the ark to set off, all the status and assets in the world won’t be worth jack shit.And anyway, nobody accepts applications for boarding this ark but me.”—Hello.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
For now we’ll limit the discussion to the question of the body.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Still, you’ve got yourself a definite problem: how are you going to win our trust?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Is that the best you can do?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Why am I so unpopular, anyway?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I just don’t get it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.“It’s because you never take a bath!” I yelled from next to the mike.—What do you mean?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For anybody engaged in sanitation work, taking baths is a duty—and plain common sense besides.The only times I don’t take a bath are when I’m stone drunk.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Bad for the heart.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.The girl began to laugh, her body chafing against mine with a hypnotic rhythm.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve never undergone hypnosis, but that must be what it’s like: the flow of time disappears and “now” takes off alone, flitting capriciously here and there.—For someone so generally disliked, you have an honest way about you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Shall I tell you what you could have said to allay our fears?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There is something.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Do you want to hear it?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Yes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—You should have said, “Try to think more like a real baddie.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A real baddie wouldn’t go to all these ridiculous lengths.He’d just haul the body over without a second thought, and dump it down from the overpass onto that pile of trash.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then you’d have to get rid of it, like it or not.” Right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—You’re right.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My son is lucky to have a shrewd thinker like you for a friend.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Is he listening?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"See, son, I’m not such a bad guy, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can’t help the way I look.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All right, then, is Laughter Hill all right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—No, let’s make it your office.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s near where the body was found, isn’t it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—You tell me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Anyway, you’re more than welcome.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve got drinks here, and all kinds of stuff to eat.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you want, I’ll send somebody over to the beach entrance to pick you up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Now just don’t spoil it by saying this will be a one-time visit.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Sorry, but that’s just what it will be.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When the body’s out of the way, we’ll have no more business with each other, right?What time shall we make it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Who’s coming?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How many in all?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Two.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Me, that’s the liaison man, and the purser.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You remember him.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He said hello awhile back.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Isn’t my son coming?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—The captain?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Out of the question.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Why?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Why else has he got a liaison man?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This is my job.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Listen, I’m all alone here.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That really has nothing to do with it, but—won’t you please let me talk to him?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You see if you can get through to him, will you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Just two or three minutes would be enough.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Please.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.“Well, what do you say?”“Never mind that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What’s happened to Sengoku?”—He wants to know where the sweet-potato man is.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—That’s funny; I guess he’s still not back.I spoke up.—If that body turns out to be his, I’ll never forgive you, you know that?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He was one decent guy.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He was one person I really thought I could work with.—Don’t get carried away.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The man’s in perfect health.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m fond of him myself.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You know what he’s always saying?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Time to start over, time to wipe the slate clean.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Serves ’em right, the bastards.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"” I know just how he feels, too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It is time to wipe the slate clean and start afresh, sort out the ones who deserve to survive from all the ones who don’t.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There—isn’t that it?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Isn’t what what?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Isn’t that the way you figure it too?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We think alike, I’m telling you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.The insect dealer interrupted.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
—What time shall we meet?Over.—Just listen for a minute.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When the apocalypse comes, deciding who ought to live and who might as well die will be no easy matter.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Isn’t that so?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What sort of yardstick are you planning on using?“What a joke,” I snorted.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Who does he think he is, preaching to people?”—I’m not preaching.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This happened just awhile back, at the spring athletic meet of the local junior high school.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They had a strange event called Survival Game.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A contest to pick out the real survivors.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Seems to have been the brainchild of some wise men who got together to decide how to use the underground air-raid shelter in the new city hall building.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Shall I go on?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.The insect dealer looked my way to check my reaction.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I refrained from issuing any objections.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It weighed heavily on me to learn Inototsu had connections in that part of town.—Keep it short, please.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Okay, I’ll just cover the main points.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As part of the fortieth-anniversary celebrations for the local junior high school, they had a contest to judge who was qualified to survive.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"From the day before, there was a front stalled just off the coast, and that morning it was drizzling; but the weather reports were encouraging, and they didn’t want to waste all the money and effort that had gone into the preparations for the event—you know, preparing the athletic fields and the decorations and all—and this survival game was a major attraction from the start.How’m I doing?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Shall I keep going?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Fine.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Yes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—It was just a game, but at first everyone was a bit confused.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The rules, you see, were unusual.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There were winners and losers, but no direct competition.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Which is maybe the way it goes with survival.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"First the playing field was divided lengthwise into three tracks, red, white, and blue, each with a starting line and a goal.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Picture it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then at the starting signal, all the participants headed for the flag of their choice.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was no need to hurry, and you didn’t have to decide on a color till the last moment if you wanted, so it was all nice and relaxed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Everyone—teachers and students, families, special guests—they all set off casually, as if going on a hike.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It could have had something to do with the prize, but for a junior high school athletic event it was a lavish production.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Are you still with me?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.The four of us exchanged glances.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For my part, as long as I didn’t have to participate in the coming discussions, I was prepared to put up with a little inconvenience.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As usually happens, silence was taken for reluctant consent.—Yeah, I guess so.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—So that’s how the participants all started off, When everybody had chosen their color and lined up accordingly, the head judge rolled a die painted in the three colors.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When the winning color came up, drums rolled and the flag of that color was unfurled.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
At that signal the losing teams were supposed to fall flat on the ground.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Get it?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Only the survivors were allowed to go back to the starting line.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then the starting signal would be given again.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It went on like that, over and over, and the last one left would be the winner.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Any questions?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—If the winners were determined by a roll of the die, it wasn’t so much a sporting event as a kind of gambling, was it?Over.—Well, luck is a crucial factor in any battle, isn’t it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
So what if it was gambling?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That only added to the excitement.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After all, the first prize was a new little red Honda motor scooter, donated by the Association of Local Shopkeepers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was in the event too, but with someone else throwing the die, there’s really no point in wearing yourself out, is there?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Stay on the track, please.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just stick to the main story.Over.—If you don’t want to hear any more, that’s okay with me.Over.—You’re off the track again.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—Did I mention the weather?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It got worse and worse—just the opposite of the forecast—until rain was falling in solid sheets.As if somebody was slathering it with a paintbrush.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.The girl laughed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I didn’t really think it was amusing, but I joined in with an appreciative snort.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Our hips were still pressed firmly together.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I knew I’d be called to account for this eventually.Both the insect dealer and the shill had their eyes tightly closed; the shill was licking his lips, the insect dealer was swaying his head from side to side.—The students’ caps were plastered flat on their heads, as if they’d been soaked in oil, and the sand in the playing field was all mucked up with little pools of water here and there.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The school physician kept whispering in the principal’s ear, and each time the principal seemed on the point of calling it off.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’d sneak a timid look at the visitors’ tent, but there was nothing doing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That brand-new Honda scooter was there just waiting for someone to claim it.If he’d called the event off just because of a little rain, there would have been violence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A promise is a promise.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And so the game went on, one way or another .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
and what do you think happened?Over.—What?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—It turned into a circus.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You see, the principal believed that everyone’s chances for survival ought to be equal, so he imposed no limits on who could participate.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And so the athletic field was jammed with people.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They had to shift the starting line up fifteen feet to accommodate them all.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Starting time was delayed eight minutes, too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was really something; you should have seen it.That great mass of people, soaking wet, sending up spray in the air and wearing down the ground under their feet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Mothers running past, dragging bawling kids by the hand; old men waving canes; an invalid, unsteady on his feet, leaning on a nurse’s shoulder; members of the Fishermen’s Union Youth League, charging forward in scrimmage formation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It took an unbelievably long time, but finally everyone poured into the goal area of their choice.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The die was cast, the flag unfurled, the drums rolled.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A few people got beat up for trying to switch places after it was all over, but for the first round, generally everyone was distributed evenly across the three goals.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The only hitch was that at first the losing teams wouldn’t hit the dirt like fallen soldiers, the way they were supposed to.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To have to roll around in the mud and rain, on top of losing, is nobody’s idea of fun, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The P.E.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"coach’s voice came screaming from all the loudspeakers: “Losing teams, please fall down.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’re dead.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All losers, hit the dirt.” People got sore and started to leave.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was one of them.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then a fusillade rang out: a volley of shots from an automatic rifle.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Taped, of course, but it had a dramatic effect.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Everybody recognizes the sound from TV and movies, even if they’ve never heard it live.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The losing teams started falling down, right according to plan.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They must have decided they owed the organizers that much, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Actually it didn’t look like a battle so much as a mass execution.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Are you still with me?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.The part of me pressed against the girl became a separate living creature, in growing control of me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was wriggling, seeking to take me over completely.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And there was another reason for the sense of unreality I felt: as the words came over the radio, each building on the rest like pieces of a puzzle, I sensed the shaping of another Inototsu, totally unlike the Inototsu I knew.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I could hardly believe this was the same person.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The Inototsu I knew would never talk this way, as if each separate word were just back from the cleaners, freshly laundered and pressed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I felt as if I were witnessing a cicada shedding its skin.—Get to the point, will you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—So that’s the way it went.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then the losing participants quit the field, and round two began, at a signal from the referee.The invalid hanging on to his nurse’s shoulder—I think he must have had palsy—well, he was in the winning team, so he made a great nuisance of himself, getting in everyone’s way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even so, up to round four everything went swimmingly, the group decreasing by two-thirds every time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The end was in sight, and a lot of people started packing up to go.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then at round five, events took a strange turn.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Shall I go on?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—We’re all ears.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Carry on.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Thanks, glad to hear it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So they got down to about eleven people, I think it was.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Everybody but the paralytic left the starting line together.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
So far so good.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then for some reason, right in front of the goals they all stopped.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Guess what happened?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Everybody just stood there, waiting for the paralytic to hobble down and catch up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Seeing him enter the blue zone, they all went in after him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Strange psychology, don’t you think—call it superstition or mob psychology—the we’re-all-in-this-together mentality.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
And the funny thing was that the die turned up blue.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All eleven survived, but this way the prize stayed beyond their grasp.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It wasn’t a violation of the rules, though, so not even the judges could complain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At round six, exactly the same thing happened.Incredibly, round seven was the same.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It began to seem uncanny.The rain was coming down harder and harder, and the lights came on, although it was really still too early.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even the students, who were usually a source of noise and confusion, stood lined up at the edge of the playing field like so many wet sandbags.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Midway through round eight, the committee in charge went into deliberations, and just then the assault began, a sudden fusillade of automatic rifle fire.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The sound effects director must have flipped out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All at once the paralytic’s knees buckled and he went down head-first into the mud.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Some people misunderstood, and laughed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The school physician came running over, medicine bag in hand, but it was too late.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The game was called off.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What do you think?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I think maybe that’s what survival is all about.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—What happened to the scooter?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over.—Ah, the prize.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They had a raffle among the ten survivors.Then the family of the old invalid put up a squawk: the others had all been waiting for him, they pointed out, in order to do whatever he did, and since he had died they should all be regarded as technically dead too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The argument does have a certain logic.Anyway, the issue remains unresolved, and the scooter is kept locked up at the school.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Isn’t that a strange story?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—What does it all boil down to?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.—I don’t know.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Haven’t any idea.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s exactly why I want to get together with you and talk things over.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Maybe you can tell me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Over.We all began smiling weakly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
From the other end of the wireless there came a noise like a blast of air escaping from a heavy rubber balloon.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That was Inototsu, laughing his old, familiar laugh.18FALLING INTO THE TOILETBack at the supply room in the work hold, we chose our weapons, the selections varying according to each person’s perception of the situation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer took a small converted revolver; had his goal been mere intimidation, something larger and more conspicuous would have served the purpose better.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He and Inototsu had seemed to achieve a certain rapport in their exchanges over the radio, but perhaps inwardly he had been preparing for the worst.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Or was this only a sign of his natural predilection for firearms?After considerable hesitation, the shill settled on a tear gas pistol designed for self-protection.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Actually it was a spray canister; I call it a pistol only because it was equipped with a trigger, and its range had been greatly increased.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This too was for actual use, not mere show—although it served only to render the enemy powerless, and had no lethal effect.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was less potent than a converted gun, and yet it suggested he sought a sure means of self-defense; the knives and crossbows he never gave a passing glance.The girl and I each took a crossbow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just as our suppositions regarding the combat determined our choice of weapon, so those choices in turn would ordain the nature of the combat.To appease the stray dogs out by the garbage dump, I picked out some pieces of dried sardines made from tainted fish (I got them at the fish market once a week, for dog food) and lifted the hatch.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As if a curtain had gone up, warm air came sweeping down, and the singing of tires on concrete pavement filled my ears.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I scattered the fish from the door of the scrapped car that camouflaged the entrance.My way of imitating a dog’s howl when I wanted to feed them differed from the howl I used to demonstrate my authority as boss.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The effect, however, was similar.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I signaled to the insect dealer and the shill to let them know the danger was gone.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As long as that pack of wild dogs obeyed me, this was one way in and out, anyway, that was firmly in my control.“When you get back, honk the horn, and I’ll come out to meet you.”“We’ll do our best not to come back with any unpleasant souvenirs.”Waving, they jumped hastily into the jeep.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The dogs, as if sensing something unusual in the air, fought viciously over the food.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I stood watching them off until the taillights disappeared in the shadow of the highway overpass.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The high-level road cut off my view like a visor, so I could not see the sky.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The rain appeared to have let up, but I couldn’t make out the horizon, so probably there was still a heavy cloud cover.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Only the lights of the fishing port on my far right gave any indication of where the sea lay.Traffic was fairly heavy.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This was the hour when long-distance trucks passed by, aiming to be in Kyushu, far to the southwest, by morning.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Out at sea, a gravel-carrier ship headed east.On my way back inside the ark, I contemplated what might happen should the two men fail to return from their errand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Day after day alone with the girl, wrapped together in a world the consistency of banana juice—she in her red artificial leather skirt, with those red lips, and drooping eyes, and that straight nose, shiny at the tip; and beside her me, forever gazing at her like a mute gorilla.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In fact, if I wished, there was no need to wait for some accident to befall my negotiating team.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I could take unilateral steps to bring about the banana-juice conditions anytime I wanted.All I had to do was set off the dynamite.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then all connection between the ark and the rest of the world would be severed.However many times they might circle the mountain, my two emissaries would never find their way back inside.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Not only them—I had power to shut out and nullify the entire world.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I knew the magic formula for escape from the world.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Given that nuclear war was inevitable anyway, it would only be hastening its onset by a little bit.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then would begin the halcyon days of a eupcaccia (and eventually, no doubt, regret so searing that I would long to chop myself in a thousand pieces and flush myself down the toilet).She was at the sink, washing coffee cups.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Below her short skirt, her slim legs were like blown glass.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Now that we were alone, she was somehow harder to approach.“Never mind that,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I’ll do it afterwards.” She froze for a few seconds, then looked at me without a flicker and asked, “What were you planning on doing first?”“I beg your pardon?”“The dishes will come after something else, right?”“I didn’t mean that.”“Mean what?”She turned off the faucet, went slowly up the stairs, and sat down on about the fifth step from the top, knees together, elbows in lap, chin in hands.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Whether she was offended or being deliberately provocative, I couldn’t tell.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Remembering when the insect dealer got such positive results by slapping her on the bottom, I thought that on the whole it was probably better to assume the latter, even if wrong.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But the right words wouldn’t come.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s the way it always goes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I let my best chances slip away.“I must say I don’t like your attitude very much.” Her voice was flat and colorless.“What attitude?”“It’s like we’re playing parrot.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.” She managed a smile the size of a gumdrop.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Oh, I hate it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Really I do.”“Hate what?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You can tell me.”“Being a woman.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s a terrible disadvantage.”“Not always, is it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You don’t seem to be at a disadvantage.”“I look completely harmless, don’t I?”“Yes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can’t imagine you hurting anybody.”“That’s why I’m so well suited for this line of work.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I make people trust me and let down their guard.”“That’s right, you’re the shill’s partner.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So you’re dangerous, are you?”“Yes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Twice I’ve swindled men by pretending to want to marry them.”After a short pause, I said, “But men do that sort of thing too.”“It’s not the same.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When a man does it, he’s a doctor, or the heir of a wealthy landowner, or a company executive, or something—he dangles his position or his property in front of his victim’s eyes as bait.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But a woman’s only bait is herself.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s a terrible disadvantage.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A man can’t very well say he’s a man for a living, but no one thinks anything about it if a woman says, ‘Oh, I’m just an ordinary woman.’ ”“Look, I haven’t got a job I can be proud of, either.”“Why not?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

It would be a disaster.” At last she laughed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If a policeman asks you your occupation, all you have to do is speak up and tell him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They don’t even ask women.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A woman is a woman, and that’s that.”“It’s discriminatory, no doubt about it.” After another pause, I asked, “Shall I make some carrot juice?”“Never mind that; let’s fix some rice for dinner.”“I can do it,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I know my way around a kitchen, you know.”“Lots of unmarried men say that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Those are the easiest ones to trap into a proposal.”“But I haven’t had even a whiff of your bait.”“Is that what you want?”The conversation had again taken a dangerous turn.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I measured out four cups of rice, put it in a pan and left the tap running while I washed it off.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No matter how thoroughly I wash it, rice I make always has a peculiar taste.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"My mother was raped by Inototsu, you see, and that’s how I came into the world.”Perhaps I shouldn’t have said so much.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But I wanted to impress it on her that I, for one, was not the sort of man who could go around brandishing the traditional male prerogatives.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was a mole, someone who might never fall into a marriage trap, but whose prospects for succeeding in any such scheme of his own were nil.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Yet I was the captain of this ark, steaming on toward the ultimate apocalypse, with the engine key right in my hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This very moment, if I so chose, I could push the switch to weigh anchor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What would she say then?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Would she call me a swindler?Or would she lift her skirt and hold out her rump for me to slap?“When I was a little girl,” she said, “our house had sliding shutters, and some birds made a nest in the shutter box outside my window.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They were like crows, only smaller, and kind of brown.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I don’t like birds.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They’re noisy in the morning, and they carry ticks and mites, and if you look closely they have spiteful looks on their faces.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I couldn’t sleep in the morning, so it got me mad, and I started to keep one shutter in the box all the time, narrowing the space so that they wouldn’t be able to get in.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I forgot all about them until the summer was gone—and then one day I saw it: there in the space between the shutter and the box was the shriveled corpse of a baby bird, with only its head sticking outside.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It must have put its head out to be fed until it got so big that it couldn’t get in or out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Isn’t that horrible?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And I’ve always thought that that’s what a mother’s love is like.” I finished washing the rice and put it on to boil.“About once a year I have a nightmare,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It’s about rape.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The rapist is me, but the victim is me too.”“That’s fascinating.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What sort of a child would be born of such a union, I wonder.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"I bet it would be wet and sticky, all tears and saliva and sweat, and nothing else.”“That doesn’t sound like you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It doesn’t suit you very well, either, that kind of talk.”“Frankly, I don’t care if it does or not.” There was an awkward silence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"How did we get started on this?“What if the nuclear bomb went off right now, and you and I were the only survivors?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What would become of us, do you think?” I asked.“We’d end up like that baby bird in the shutter box.”“Then there must be a mother bird somewhere.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But where?”“How do I know?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Anyway, to the baby bird, the mother is nothing but a beak bringing food.”A mole’s conversation: digging my way in further and further, with only my whiskers to guide me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or else it was a heart-in-mouth dance on wafer-thin ice.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But a dance, for all that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was strangely buoyant.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I wanted to grab this chance to come to an agreement with her about our life together here after the apocalypse, so that I could push the dynamite switch anytime.“But we’re not like the baby bird,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"Snapped every ten seconds from a plane, for surveying purposes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"You can complain after that,” I said.The maps and stereoscope were on the shelf over the toilet, along with my cameras and other valuables.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shelf was fitted with sliding glass doors on rollers, but they were insulated with rubber to protect against humidity, which made them a little tricky to open and close.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I removed my shoes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The edge of the toilet was slippery, and besides, I was fond of the feel of stone against the soles of my feet; I usually went around barefoot.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The knee I had injured on the department store rooftop still wasn’t completely back to normal, either.“If you had to choose between a real diamond one hundredth of an inch in diameter, and a glass stone three feet across, which would you take?” she asked.Might as well let myself in for it, I thought.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As long as I’d invited her on a map trip, why not get out my camera too, for the first time in a long while?“Let’s see.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

I don’t believe it.”“He was over twice as fast.”I lost my balance.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My left foot slipped all the way into the toilet and stuck fast, from the toes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That was the leg bearing scars from the time Inototsu had chained me up.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Trying to prop myself up, I grabbed the flushing lever without thinking.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was an overwhelming roar as a cylinder of water shot down through the long pipe.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Suction clamped on my foot like a powerful vise, so that my leg, acting as a stopper, was dragged down deeper and deeper.The more I struggled, the stronger the attraction became, until the leg was caught all the way to the calf.The girl sprang up and stood stiff with alarm.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“What’s the matter?” she cried.“How ridiculous!,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Nothing like this ever happened before.” Only my toes could still move, ever so slightly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A slimy sensation ran up and down my spine.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The pipes were certain to be crawling with germs.19THE LIVING AIRFor a while the girl held her breath.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She moistened her lower lip as if to laugh, but the frown wrinkles in her forehead were too deep; she was caught between fear and laughter.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That wasn’t surprising: even I, though my insides were knotted with panic, felt a certain desire to giggle.“Well, this is some fix,” I said.“Can’t you get out?”“Won’t budge.”“You’ve got to relax,” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Try a different position.”“You’re right.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Let’s see, I guess I’d better get my weight off that leg.”In a case like this, getting hysterical only makes matters worse.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The essential thing was to stay calm, keep up my courage, take my time, and avoid wasting energy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"First, in order to distribute my weight more evenly, I tried shifting my body so that the edge of the toilet came just between my knees.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Now it felt as if one foot had on a toilet shoe.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My weight was equally distributed, but I knew I couldn’t maintain that position for long.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The leg bowed out at the knee.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was there nothing else I could do?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perhaps it would be better to bend my knees ninety degrees as if I were sitting in a chair.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But there was no chair, no seat at all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’d have to have someone make me a stool of the proper height.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But fitting it to the curve of the toilet would take time and skill.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was beyond the powers of the girl.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Perhaps I’d better negotiate with that chimpanzee—the one on TV that was faster at threading needles than a human.Like someone fingering a puzzle ring, mentally I traced the connections among my joints and muscles.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She was still keeping a dubious eye on me, wary perhaps lest I catch her off guard.“In cases like these, don’t people usually dial the police or the fire station?” she asked.“Yes—say, if someone gets stuck in an elevator, that sort of thing, they do.”“Well, when you were working in the fire station, didn’t you get any calls like that?”“I remember listening in while someone gave advice to someone whose ring wouldn’t come off.”“What was the advice?”“Elevate the finger above the heart, and rub it with saliva or soap—just common sense.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But I can hardly elevate my leg, and putting soap on it would have the opposite effect.”“I’ve heard of sawing rings off, too.”“Yes, they do that sometimes.”“That machine on the table upstairs—isn’t it an electric saw?”“Forget it,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Those are hard to use.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Nothing for amateurs to mess with.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

I can go anywhere.”I felt a leaden weight around my ankle.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My thoughts began to lose coherency.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was as if a ball of string wound too tight had suddenly started to come apart in my hands.“Would you mind lending me a shoulder?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Let’s see if we can’t pull my leg out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The longer it’s in there, the tougher it’s going to be getting it out, once it starts swelling.” She stood in front of the toilet with her back to me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Without the least hesitation, I put my arms around her shoulders and pressed up close against her, leaning my full weight on her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Her hair smelled like toasted seaweed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If not for my laughable predicament, this dramatic event might well have turned my whole life around.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was still hope, I thought.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That foot might pop right out without causing any relative change in our positions.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Bending my elbows, I hauled myself up vertically.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The only thing to change was her position.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Her shoulders tilted, she slumped forward, and my knee curved forward too, defying its construction.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The pain stopped just short of unbearable.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I had achieved nothing.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Only the sensation of physical contact with her saved me from blind panic.“It’s no use,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The inside of the pipe is a vacuum.”“How long does it take to get from here to the Broom Brigade headquarters and back?” she asked.“No more than ten minutes one way.”“Then if they finished quickly they could be on their way back now.”“It won’t be that easy,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“They’re talking about a human corpse, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

So this was the cozy time alone with her that I had waited for so eagerly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I felt sick.“When the cork in a wine bottle gets stuck, there’s the devil of a time getting it out, you know,” I said.“Let me know if you want anything.”“I’m okay for now.”“Does it hurt?”“It itches as much as it hurts.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The blood must be congesting.”After a pause, she looked up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The inside of the pipe is a vacuum, right?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Isn’t there a valve somewhere below?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you open the valve, the pressure ought to go back to normal.”“Maybe.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve never actually checked it out, but I imagine it’s built to take advantage of the different levels of underground water.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So the actual valve creating this suction is the water itself, and beyond that, somewhere, there must be something geared to a lever that cuts off the flow of water.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Something on the order of a hydraulic turbine.”“I’ll go take a look,” she volunteered, bounding up like a spring.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Anybody can move that way when they’re light of weight.“Tell me the way.”“That’s just it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I don’t know.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As far as I can tell, there is no way to get there.”“That doesn’t make any sense.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Somebody must have gone in to do the installation work.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There’s got to be a way in.”“I used to think so too, but I’ve gone over the area pretty thoroughly.”“Maybe it’s blocked off.”“There’s no sign of it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This is a guess, but I have an idea some other outfit tunneled underneath without permission.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The competition was fierce, and the various explorations were like spiders’ webs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
One cave-in after another.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You want to take a look at the maps?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
When I lost my balance I knocked down a scrap album along with those photos—over there.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Mind getting it and bringing it here?”Reluctantly she came down the stairs.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It is funny,” she said.“It doesn’t figure.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After all, the plumbing was installed below so that it could be used up here.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Don’t tell me it just happened to connect up.”Gingerly she handed me the scrapbook, as if determined to come only so close and no closer, then she hurriedly withdrew her hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I must have been a sorry sight.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She was right; a stupid bungle like this deserved not sympathy but scorn.“Look,” I said, “here’s a map of the work hold.”“Don’t bother.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m not a map person.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You don’t look very good.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Shall I get you some medicine?”“I guess a couple of aspirin wouldn’t hurt.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You don’t mind?Remember that medicine box before—under the chaise longue?The aspirin are in a green holder.”While she was off getting the aspirin, I flipped through the scrapbook, scanning the areas that had not yet been closely surveyed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Mine shafts lacking either ladders or lifts, and waterways very far underground, were still virtually unexplored.There was danger in exploring them, and anyway they lay on the other side of the line that would be formed when my dynamite blasts cut us off from the rest of the world.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But if I ever made up my mind to go back and investigate, it was just possible that I might come on a passage leading in under the toilet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My powers of concentration were dimming.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My knee began to buzz, and suddenly a spectrum of pain exploded through me, branching all the way to my armpit.“Is one enough?” she asked.“Make it three.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"People usually fix the dosage by age, but it ought to be by weight.”“Want me to take your picture?”“What for?”“You look just like a human potted plant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"If the slate really does get wiped clean, and I get a chance to start over, I’m going to give up being a woman for a living, and take up photography.”“By then it’ll be too late.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This is the age of advertising—you can make a go of it as a photographer as long as you have a knack for business; that’s all the talent you really need.”“Don’t be mean.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.. I’ve got to yell.”“Is it asleep?”“No.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Would you mind holding my hand?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I have a chill.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just let me touch you somewhere, anywhere.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Your tits, your ass .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I don’t care.”She sat motionless on the bottom step, her look frozen.Screams squeezed up through my body like toothpaste through a tube, and came pouring out my throat.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I beat my thighs with both hands like a bird beating its wings, and went on screeching like a monkey.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She covered her ears.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"While I howled, a thought crossed my mind: Of all the stupid things—I still haven’t found out her name!20THE BODY WAS WRAPPEDIN A BLUE PLASTIC SHEET“Be quiet!” the girl screamed, stomping on the floor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It being stone, this effort was wasted, but I was tired of howling anyway, and ready to call it quits.“Listen,” she commanded.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Isn’t that a car horn?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Maybe it’s them.”I had to admit she could be right.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Go check it out, will you?” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My throat burned.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The reverberations of my howls lingered deep in my ears, so that my ordinary speaking voice sounded no louder than a murmur.Crossbow in hand, the girl circled around the toilet, keeping her distance, and headed for the hatch.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The vertical ladder was impossible to negotiate holding the crossbow.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She stood the weapon upright at the foot of the ladder and started climbing insecurely.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With every step her red artificial leather skirt peeled higher, exposing bare flesh.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Her every movement injected high-pressure gas into my veins.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That I could still react this way, even though my trapped foot felt now as if it weighed more than all the rest of me, seemed nothing short of incredible.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Fresh anger flooded me at my clumsiness in failing to capitalize on our time alone.She unbarred the steel door and opened it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The sound of the horn was now unmistakable.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The dogs were barking for all they were worth.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Their sensitive ears had probably picked up my howls through the wall, which would make them all the more excited.Signaling reassurance, she disappeared into the tunnel.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Only a few minutes now and the two men would be here to rescue me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Some loss of dignity was inevitable.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But now there was a good chance I could be freed at last, by whatever means.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Perhaps because I had relaxed, my leg became several dozen times itchier than before.The itch was more maddening than the pain.She came back and poked her head in the doorway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“What shall I do?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They want you to get rid of the dogs for them.”“I can’t.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I can’t get out of here.”“But they’re going crazy, those dogs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”“Hmm.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Well .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"maybe I could try using a hand mike.” As she came down the ladder, I grew impatient at her excessive caution even as I savored the sight of her skirt rolling up.“Look over on the side of the table by the bookcase,” I said.“You’ll find one in with the electrical parts, the soldering iron, and so on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Red, shaped like a trumpet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The microphone and speaker are detachable.”I got her to hand me the mike and carry the speaker down to the far end of the tunnel.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When she gave me the mike, I deliberately saw to it that our fingertips touched; she did not seem to mind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was it because the shill was back—or was it all my imagination?“What do I do?” she asked.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Just turn it on?”“Pull the antenna all the way out and turn the volume all the way up.” I turned on the mike and pulled out its antenna.“Testing, testing, one, two, three .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”I whispered the words, but they came booming back at me in a voice as loud and bold as a foghorn.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I quieted my breathing, positioned the back of my tongue up against my soft palate, and took a deep breath.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was a noise in the toilet like the sound of wet noodles hitting the floor.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I felt myself slide in a fraction of an inch deeper.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Or had I imagined it?With all the emotion I could muster, using every skill at my disposal, I burst into a long, sorrowful threnody.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The sheer volume of my voice surprised even me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It must have throbbed into the night sky over town with such force that even now, I thought, some well-meaning soul must be phoning the police.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The girl reappeared and signaled “Okay” with her fingers.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I worried that perhaps now the dogs would no longer be satisfied with my old way of howling.The dogs were quiet, but there was still no sign of my two emissaries.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I turned down the mike and tried calling them:“Hey—what’s the holdup?”“They say they’ve got something with them,” the girl called back.“Tell them to save it for later.”She conferred with them a few minutes before reporting:“They say it’s really important.”“What could be more important than my leg?”“They’re here,” she said, and started down the ladder, recoiling.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She, at any rate, could come down as slowly as she liked, as far as I was concerned.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After an interval the shill appeared, his back to me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He was dragging something wrapped in a heavy blue plastic sheet of the sort used on construction sites.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was about the size of a human body rolled up in a ball, and it appeared to be fairly heavy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Oh, no, I thought.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was this the body, after all?Next to appear was the one pushing the bundle: not the insect dealer, as I’d expected, but Sengoku, his shoulders rising and falling as he panted from the exertion.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Dressed in the unlikely combination of a well-ironed open-collared white shirt and khaki work pants torn at the knee, he first bowed deeply to the girl, then caught sight of me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Seemingly unable to make sense of what he saw, he just kept staring.The shill then turned around, stood on tiptoe, and let go of the plastic-wrapped bundle in apparent incredulity.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Surprised myself by all this, I could not immediately think of anything to say.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The girl spoke up on my behalf.“He fell in and got stuck.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Got any ideas?”There was a long, preternatural silence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The first to break it would be the loser.“Sorry, but I’ve got to take a leak,” announced the shill in a flat, rapid voice, and retreated back down the tunnel.“You can’t get out of there?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But why .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"?” Sengoku spoke anxiously, his voice husky.“I’m stuck.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Where’s Komono?” My voice too was hoarse.But it seemed wiser not to take in any liquid for the time being.“In conference with the Broom Brigade.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A lot’s been happening.”“What’s in that thing?” I asked.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Not sweet potatoes, I hope.”“Don’t be ridiculous.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You know very well it’s a body.” He controlled his irritation, and added more quietly, “That was the deal all along, wasn’t it?”“But I thought if there was a body it was going to be yours.”“Thanks a lot.”“How awful .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".” The girl retrieved her crossbow and came back toward me, measuring the distance between us as she did so, and halting about thirty feet away.“Whose body is it?” I demanded.“Whose do you think?” answered Sengoku.“Somebody I know?”“I think you’ll be surprised.”“Well, if it’s not you, then .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
you’re kidding me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s not Komono, is it?”“It couldn’t be,” the girl broke in.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“There was talk about a body even before he left here.”“Then who the hell is it?” Pain in my leg kept me from being able to organize my thoughts.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Who else was there whose death might surprise me?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When my own mother died, I’d felt less emotion than if I’d dropped a camera and damaged the lens.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Of course, at the time I’d been living with Inototsu (I hadn’t had any choice), and the death notice had come two weeks after the fact.“This is a rather, uh, difficult body.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s going to be a bit ticklish to handle, I’m afraid.” Sengoku’s gaze swept rapidly back and forth from one end of the hold to the other, his eyes greedy with curiosity.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This was his first look at the place where waste materials were illegally disposed of, and where that unknown quantity the manhole manager—his associate—lived.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Say, Mole,” he started, and then corrected himself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“That john where you’re soaking your foot—is that the famous manhole?” The girl objected sharply.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“He’s not ‘soaking his foot.’ Does it look like he’s enjoying himself ?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Haven’t you got eyes?” Her no-nonsense manner made her seem older; she was in fact no child, I reflected.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This might well be her real self.“Now remember, I wasn’t hiding it from you, or anything,” I blabbered nervously, acutely self-conscious.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I was going to let you in on it when the time came.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In my mind, you’ve been one of us all along.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I knew I could make a go of it with you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I really mean it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ve got your ticket all laid aside.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Now’s the perfect chance, so—” He interrupted me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Are you sure you aren’t talking that way for spite?”“Certainly not.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What makes you say that?”“You sure you aren’t putting on some kind of act just to keep us from getting rid of the body?”“Of course not.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ve been waiting for help.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Come on over and give me a hand, will you?”“An act, you say?” The shill came back through the tunnel, hunched forward, still zipping his trousers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When he saw me he froze, hand on his zipper, like a clumsy paper cutout.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“What the devil are you waiting for?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Aren’t you out of there yet?”“We tried everything,” said the girl, and shook her head firmly, having at last regained her buoyancy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The presence of her old partner apparently bolstered her spirits.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“The pressure is unbelievable.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s a vacuum inside, and he can’t move his leg at all, either by pulling it or twisting it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I gave him some aspirin before and that may have helped, but until just before you came back it was awful.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He was screaming his head off.”“Looking for sympathy, if you ask me.” The shill closed the steel door and shot the bolt.“Fall in yourself, and you’ll see,” I said caustically.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It’s like having someone do a job on the sole of your foot with a wire brush.”“A vacuum, huh?” said Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“How much pressure is being exerted?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s what we’ve got to find out.” He spoke with a cool detachment.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“When the decompression ratio passes a certain limit, first blood oozes out, then the skin ruptures and the muscles split apart.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Judging from the fact that the pipe and his leg are in contact, without losing equilibrium, the pressure may not be so high after all.”“Never mind the fancy explanation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just get me out of here.”“First we’ll haul the body over.” The shill signaled to Sengoku, and together they started to drag the plastic-wrapped bundle.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill headed for the ladder, while Sengoku, unaware of the danger, headed unsuspecting for the stairs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The rope slipped off and a corner of the vinyl sheet came askew.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Under it there appeared no blood or flesh but only a glimpse of shiny black—a trash bag, it looked like—which in its own way intensified my impression of the corpse’s physical reality.“Careful, don’t go that way!” the girl called out to Sengoku, her voice as bright and animated as an ocean breeze after a calm.Did she use that tone instinctively with strange men?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“There’s a trap on the stairs.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s not safe.”“This place is booby-trapped from one end to the other.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You know that much, don’t you?” Without seeming to expect an answer, the shill looked down from the landing and added, “Why don’t we just throw it down from here?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It weighs a ton.”“We can’t do that,” protested Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“This is a human being.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was, I mean.”“That’s the whole point: it’s dead, not alive.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If it gets a little knocked up now, so much the easier to flush it away later.” The girl made some kind of motion, but as she had her back to me, I couldn’t interpret it very well.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Smiling sourly, the shill turned to the plastic sheet and brought his hands together in a gesture of respect.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sengoku put one foot awkwardly on the bundle and started to tuck the stray corner back under the rope.“I really wish you’d leave that, and come give me a hand now.” I tried to stay calm, but my voice was growing strangely shrill—first from the acute discomfort I was in (by now it felt as if my heart had slipped down inside my trapped knee) and second at my growing fear that no way of escape might ever be found.“Without this toilet, how do you plan on getting rid of that body, anyway?”“Look, don’t be in such a hurry, will you?” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He signaled to Sengoku and together the two men started to push the bundle off the landing.“If you knew whose body this was, Captain, you wouldn’t be so coldhearted,” he added.“Who’s coldhearted?” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You’re the one who’s dropping it on the floor.”As the girl let out a scream, the blue plastic bundle did a one-and-a-half twist in midair, then hit the floor with the unmistakable squish of flesh and blood.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"(Clay, of course, would make approximately the same noise.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
")“Who is it?” I demanded again.“We ought to pay our respects before we flush him away, said the shill as he came down the ladder, followed by Sengoku.The girl was staring at the bundle, her crossbow pressed against her chest.“Who is it?” I insisted, refusing to be put off.“Well, properly speaking, Captain,” said the shill, “this is you.” He wiped his mouth and turned around.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His nostrils looked pinched, and the whites of his eyes had a bluish tinge.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Evidently he was not as collected as he had seemed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No matter how he wiped the corners of his mouth, pale flecks of saliva kept reappearing.“Come again?”“Well, uh .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"actually, it’s, uh .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".” Sengoku fumbled for words, his voice dry and scratchy.“What in God’s name are you talking about?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m in no mood for practical jokes, let me tell you.”“In other words .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"it’s you,” said the shill, rubbing his mouth, and then wiping that hand on the tail of his shirt.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Your substitute, anyway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He was killed in your place.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The killer, who made the first move, apparently mistook him for you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So if it hadn’t been for this guy, you’d be wrapped up in this sheet right now.”“Who’s the killer?” I asked.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Simultaneously the girl asked,“Who’s the substitute?”“Try asking the guy who was supposed to get bumped off; he must know,” said Sengoku with a false air of toughness.“I haven’t any idea,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Someone who looked like me?”“Not really.” Sengoku tilted his head in seeming discomfort, and looked to the shill for help.“It must be Komono.” Teeth clenched, the girl retreated yet farther from the plastic-wrapped bundle.“What about him?” I asked her.“He died in your place,” she said.“Then who did him in—Inototsu?” I asked, the pain in my leg forgotten.“No.” The shill indicated the motionless bundle with a jerk of his head, and added with apparent effort, “If you really want to know, it was the other way around.”“Komono killed Inototsu, you say?” My voice shook with tension, as if needles were jabbing my eardrums.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Then the thing under that plastic sheet is .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“Well, let’s get the ceremony over with, shall we?” said the shill.“You stay out of this,” I snapped.My eyes remained glued to the blue plastic sheet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Could this really be Inototsu?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That animal who wore a green hunting cap and went around smelling like fermented beans wrapped in a dirty old rag?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That monster who trampled his own wife to death, raped my mother, chained me to the toilet, and bulldozed concrete buildings on behalf of the waterstone interests?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That friendless bastard who sold a thriving fishermen’s inn and two twenty-five-ton fishing vessels to run for city council over and over—but never to win—and who first pinned a badge on his chest only when he became leader of the Broom Brigade?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I felt liberated.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I must have feared him more than I realized—more than I hated him, even.There was no other emotion.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perhaps getting my leg caught in the jaws of the toilet had numbed my feelings.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Had I witnessed the actual killing, no doubt it would have been different.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I could not help being amazed at his enormous bulk, even folded up as he was.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Had they merely bent him over, or had they dismembered him and rearranged the parts?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I recalled having heard once that no evidence is so hard to dispose of as the human body; the full meaning of that statement hit me now with fresh force.“It doesn’t figure,” muttered the girl, her jaw set.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Why would Komono mistake him for the captain?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How could he?”“He didn’t.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s more complicated than that.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I can’t sum it up as well as Komono could, but basically it’s not a simple case of right and wrong.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Originally there was another suspect, who was after the captain, and that’s who Inototsu mistook Komono for.”“That’s right,” echoed Sengoku, waving both his fists as he sought to explain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“The ‘body’ Inototsu was talking about referred to that suspect.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Whether he actually intended to do him in or was just bluffing, I couldn’t say.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Right now Komono is gathering facts from the Broom Brigade, so we ought to know more soon.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Also, in my opinion, Komono was overly suspicious of Inototsu.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He got too much of an indoctrination from the captain here.” The shill looked at the bundle and rubbed his hands on his pants.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It does seem as if he didn’t give him enough of a chance.That revolver he had was bad.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Mind you, I’m not finding fault; it was legitimate self-defense.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The only problem is that he left bullets in the body.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If an autopsy is done, a bullet could be found, and traced, which would make things rough for the captain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Komono told me to tell you, though, that he’d see to it that everybody in the Broom Brigade kept his mouth shut, so not to worry.”“That man is meant for better things than liaison work,” said Sengoku, nodding seriously.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“He’s a born leader.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Why, he’s already taken over the leadership of the Broom Brigade.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Inototsu hadn’t been dead ten minutes before he’d reorganized the brigade on new lines, and was issuing commands right and left.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".” The ants nesting in my foot now changed to flies, whose maggots attacked my nerves voraciously.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I hadn’t meant to scream, yet here I was screaming.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Wishing desperately that the scrapbook in my hands were a hammer, in rage I kicked blindly with my free leg.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What bore the brunt of this frenzied attack was not the toilet but the knee of my entrapped leg.21“ATTENTION SAUSAGE STUFFERS:DEAD HOGS DELIVERED FREE OF CHARGE”If the shill and Sengoku had not supported me on either side as I thrashed around, I might easily have broken my leg.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The pain served to clear my head.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the interim I had wet my pants slightly, but that didn’t matter.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The benefit of it all was that now, taken aback by my outburst, the two men began to think seriously about my rescue.First I had them get me two more aspirin and a triple-strength antihistamine.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then I had them wrap a chilled compress around the thigh of the entrapped leg.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Finally I had them each hold up one end of a section of steel pipe left over from the plumbing installation, which I clung to, while the girl massaged my knee with both hands.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I mustered all my strength; the insect dealer and the shill cheered me on, straining their voices to the limit.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The steel pipe bent, Sengoku’s shoulder made a popping noise as if on the point of dislocating—and again I wet my pants.More this time—about a full cup’s worth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was no sign whatever that the leg had moved.Mindful of the liquid trickling from my pants down the inside of my leg toward the knee, I decided that holding back any longer could lead only to uremia.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I had somebody bring me the steamer from the galley.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The bottom was scorched black, so I had no scruples about using it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They all turned their backs while I relieved myself into it.“Whoever heard of using a potty from inside a toilet?Nobody’d believe it,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Plainly he was trying to joke away his confusion and dismay.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The seriousness of the situation had begun to impress itself on him.“Well, once I saw a butterfly flying around inside an airplane, but it didn’t seem particularly strange.” The girl’s voice was too bright; was she perhaps attempting to cover up the sound of my urinating?Once the sound broke off and Sengoku, mistakenly assuming I was through, turned around.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Oops, sorry,” he said.“Thought you’d finished.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Say, you’ve got a whopper there, don’t you?”At this the shill turned around too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It’s just because he’d been holding his water so long,” he opined.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Anybody would get that big.”The girl, of course, kept her eyes ahead of her.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As I put the lid on the steamer and tried to ease it to the floor, a stabbing pain shot through my knee, erasing the retort I had prepared.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Sengoku took the steamer from me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Perhaps he wasn’t such a bad sort after all.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Slowly the pain in my belly eased.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Evidently the tension in my bladder had been aggravating the pain in my leg.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then my eyes fell on the badge on the collar of Sengoku’s open-necked shirt, and though I knew I should thank him, instead I blurted out a sarcastic remark.“Well, well—gold brooms, is it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Very fancy.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And how long have we been wearing this?”“It’s just gold-plated.” Sengoku rubbed his Broom Brigade badge with the ball of his thumb and added, “Ordinary members are silver.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you joined, Captain, of course yours would be gold-plated, probably with horizontal stripes to boot.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Upper echelons have those.”The shill stepped back and gazed fixedly at me up and down, taking in my exact relationship to the toilet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I get it,” he said.“You’re in the same trouble as a bottle of wine with a cork stopper, after it’s stayed too long in the fridge.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What’s the procedure in a case like that?”“You can either warm it to expand the air or open a hole in the cork with a nail to let air in,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“One or the other.” I shot the girl a warning look, meaning for her to keep quiet, and went on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“In this case, there’s no way to heat it, so the only thing to do is open a hole.”“I agree.” Sengoku rubbed his injured shoulder, pursed his lips, and smiled.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Something in his manner struck me as servile, though perhaps I only imagined it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Logically you’ve got to achieve a balance with the external air pressure.”“Let’s see—where’d be the best place to drive in a nail?” The shill studied the area between the toilet bowl and the floor.“If you drilled seven or eight inches down in the concrete, you’d come out below my foot.”“Well, of course we can’t do that,” he said unceremoniously.He was smiling—rare for him—but the smile was cruel.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Your leg will heal with proper medicine and care, Captain, but what happens if you wreck this toilet?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The ship is nothing without it.How would you ever explain it to Komono?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Disposing of the body has got to be our number-one priority.”“How about inserting a rubber hose between his leg and the toilet wall?” The girl’s voice was animated, but she didn’t sound very confident.“There’s not enough room.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I may be fat, but I’m no water cushion.” Once again my pulse beat a threatening drumbeat in the calf of my leg.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The mere thought of some foreign object being stuck between my skin and the pipe made my lungs start to expand with a budding scream.“Wait—that’s not a bad idea.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A narrow pipe of copper or steel just might work,” said Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He came over and made as if to poke a finger between my leg and the toilet wall.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
In his enthusiasm he had failed to reckon with the ferocity of a wounded boar.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I grabbed his finger and twisted it sharply up.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I have no illusions about my strength—but even so I’m close to average compared to Sengoku, whose muscles are like dried fish.“Cut it out—you’ll break it!” he screamed.“Apologize,” I said.“What for?”“Never mind; just apologize.”“I’m sorry.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Stop hurting me!”“I’m in a lot more pain than you are.”“I’m sorry.”“If you’re really sorry, give it to me straight.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"However it happened, Inototsu here ended up dead, I can see that—but what ground have you got for saying he died in my place?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Tell it to me in plain language.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Who’s to say you’re not just making up the whole thing?”“There were graffiti sprayed all over the walls down at the garbage dump by the tangerine grove—‘Attention sausage stuffers: Dead hogs delivered free of charge.’ ” His voice was so feeble that I let go of his hand.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After retreating a safe distance, he rubbed the joint with a sullen look.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Once again my clumsiness had earned me an enemy.“What proof is that?” I sniffed.“It’s obvious who would do a thing like that, isn’t it?” he said.“In other words, it had to be somebody who lumped you in with the Broom Brigade, Captain.” In an apparent effort to sort out his thoughts, the shill pressed his forehead against his clasped hands, so that he appeared to be gazing through them.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Or maybe they had the idea you were the Brigade’s real leader.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
So they took out their grudge against them on you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"”“What was that about sausage—say it again, the graffiti,” I said.“ ‘Attention sausage stuffers: Dead hogs delivered free of charge.’ You could take it as a kind of death threat, couldn’t you?” said Sengoku, smiling slightly.Still staring at his clasped hands, the shill went on: “Yes, now that I think of it, Komono and I should have marched right in, in plain view.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Komono wouldn’t hear of it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Thanks to his line of work, which involves pulling the wool over people’s eyes, he was beside himself with suspicion, determined nobody was going to pull anything over on him.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He hardly looks the part, but it turns out his favorite strategy is—what’s it called?—a commando operation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Penetrating deep into enemy territory with a handful of men.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It probably comes from an overdose of TV, more than any influence from his SDF days.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
So there we were—just like some hostage rescue squad.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Well, I’m a shill by trade.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What could I do but jump in with both feet?“We stopped the jeep a fair distance away and then walked.After carefully looking the place over, we synchronized our watches and split up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Three minutes later I knocked on the front door.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"While the enemy’s attention was diverted—I realize thinking of them as the ‘enemy’ was strange, but anyway—Komono sneaked through a back window into enemy headquarters.Assuming everything went according to plan, that is.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What really happened I have no way of knowing.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Since my knocking on the door was intended to form a diversion, I guess I overdid it a little; in fact, I broke the glass.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The next thing I knew, the lights went out—whether because someone turned them off on purpose, scenting danger, or because the power just happened to fail, I don’t know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I do know that at almost the same moment I heard a pistol shot.” He was silent a moment before continuing.“What do you make of it, Captain?” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I see it as a case of internal strife.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On the personal level it’s murder, of course, but if it were two countries involved, it seems to me they’d both be victims, caught in a trap.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And the intended victim, after all, was you.”“Bravo,” said Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I could never have summed it up half so well.” The remark was apparently sincere, meant as neither flattery nor sarcasm.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That uncomplicated sincerity of his was what I found most amiable about Sengoku.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was something I, who postured like a hedgehog even with the odds all against me, could never imitate.I said, “But who’s responsible for the graffiti?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I haven’t got any idea.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, there’s no motive.”“Cleaning up graffiti could have been part of the Broom Brigade’s work.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Still, that’s a weak motive for murder.” Sengoku swung his injured arm around in big circles, taking deep breaths.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Komono should be back anytime now with the whole story.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”“Mind if I borrow that steamer?” asked the girl in a low voice.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No need to ask what for.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No need even to reply.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Cradling the steamer, still warm from the heat of my body, she headed for the work hold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My chest burned with a mixture of shame and something akin to happiness.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The fever in my leg shot up to the limit.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But it appeared the aspirin was working, for the pain was now minimal, and the high dosage of antihistamines had effectively soothed my nerves.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Seeing Sengoku strain his ears, I was even able secretly to enjoy an ironic sense of victory.Then the situation began to change rapidly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"From the work hold there emerged a buzzing sound that matched nobody’s anticipation: a sound that no physiological function of hers could possibly produce, however one wrenched the imagination.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Had the insect dealer returned through the maze of tunnels?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For someone so terrified of dogs, it was certainly possible.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Now that he was leader of the Broom Brigade (which I still tended to doubt—it seemed unreal), he would have access to reliable guides.The girl came rushing back in.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In her confusion and agitation, the movements of her legs were totally out of sync with the swaying of her body.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She seemed to be trying to tell us something, but she was gasping too hard for the words to come out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Like a signboard torn off in a sharp gust of wind, she flew over to the bottom of the stairs and snatched up the crossbow.Shoulders heaving, she adjusted her panties through her skirt.“What’s the matter?” We all three said the same thing at once, our words overlapping.The answer was not long in coming.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Restless footsteps strode toward us down the corridor.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The steps were quick, light, and squishy; my guess was rubber-soled sneakers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The girl loaded an arrow into her crossbow.Two young men the shape and complexion of withered sticks bounded into the room and planted themselves side by side in front of the row of storage drums.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They looked to be in their late teens.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Their forelocks were teased till the hair stood on end; they wore leather jackets, one red and one purple, and baggy pants tied at the ankles.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Evidently some sort of hoodlums.“Keep out of our way!” yelled one of them, in a hoarse voice that still hadn’t changed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He drew a chain off his belt.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not to be outdone, I screamed back at him and lunged for my Uzi, forgetting about my trapped leg.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Apparently mistaking my outburst for a signal to attack, simultaneously they raised their chains, swung them round, and charged.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was a clever plan, calculated to leave the enemy no time to think.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In reflex, the girl pulled the trigger of her crossbow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The aluminum arrow scored a direct hit on the ear of the youth in the red jacket, struck the floor, and rebounded with a light, brief reverberation that sounded ominous, in view of the damage just done.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill quickly loaded the other crossbow, while Red Jacket put a hand to his ear and stared at the moist red blood on his palm.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Without another word, the pair turned and sprang up toward the hatch like a couple of jumping rats.Had it been them all along?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I asked myself.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All those times I sensed the presence of something, only for it to disappear so fast that I would conclude it had been my imagination, or rats.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".Even the shill, just hours ago, had been lured on in chase for the better part of a mile.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
These hoodlums were certainly capable of spray-painting graffiti on walls.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Nor was it hard to imagine them plotting to eliminate me, in order to take over the quarry for themselves.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They must have lumped me and Inototsu together in their minds.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill’s and Sengoku’s statements took on more and more plausibility.The request Inototsu had made for disposal of a corpse, before he turned into one himself, needed rethinking.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My first reaction had been one of simple dismay at the imposition, but perhaps I’d been blind to what was going on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Those teenagers might belong to an army—an army of termites eating holes in the ark.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Perhaps unknown to me, the ark was already spongy with holes, end to end.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then, they were no less my enemies than Inototsu had been.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was one of them dead?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or had the request been meant as a reservation for disposal of a future corpse?Sengoku had indicated it might have been either way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In any case, the bellicose attitude of those two young hoodlums indicated that the situation was extremely tense.They ran along the row of storage drums and up the stairs toward the hatch.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The next thing we knew, they stepped on the hidden trap and fell, exactly according to plan.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill and the girl howled with laughter, clutching their sides—especially her.But with the agility of youth, the hoodlums grabbed the landing railing on the rebound and swung themselves nimbly to the head of the stairs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They lifted the latch and dived down the tunnel.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The dogs began to bark.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The door swung heavily shut, with a long, loud reverberation.The girl at last stopped laughing, wiped her eyes, and said,“Didn’t you leave the key in the jeep?”“You expect me to go out and get it?” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Didn’t you hear those dogs?” He cleared his nose and spat.“I’ve heard those dogs are savage,” said Sengoku, frowning.“Please, let’s have no more deaths.”“What do you mean?” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You people are the ones who wanted to play war games for keeps, aren’t you?” He nodded his head at the blue bundle, adding, “You had great plans for this toilet.”Sengoku replied in a spiritless voice, “It wasn’t going to be that kind of war.”“War?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What war?” asked the girl.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Curiosity made her voice rise and fall like a kitten arching its back.“The war against those hoodlums,” said the shill smugly, and then looked at Sengoku for confirmation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Isn’t that right?”“Who—them?” she said blankly, losing interest.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“But there were only two of them, and they took off like jackrabbits.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".” She came over and circled halfway around the toilet, her eyes on my trapped leg.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Look, we’ve got to do something about the captain’s leg,” she announced.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Let’s all think harder.”“You’re wrong,” retorted Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It’s not only those two.” He was undoubtedly right.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There had to be more of them than that.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And as for my leg—in the end the only thing to do was to open a hole in the pipe, which I intended to have done; even so, tracking down the youths’ headquarters might still be the quickest way to a solution.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They were stowaways, living undetected in some unexplored section of the ark.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Which made it quite possible that they knew all about the passageway to the toilet’s lower mechanisms.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Very possible indeed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had had zero success in locating a passageway to the eastern entrance, by Kabuto Bridge—yet from the outside, one was plainly visible.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The opening was midway up a cliff facing the Kabuto River, so it had been left unsealed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What better place for them to settle in?In the old days there had been a road there, used for hauling rock, but during a huge landslip several months before the closing of the quarry, it had been sliced cleanly away, as if by knife.Compressed air had blasted through the maze of tunnels until the entire mountain howled like a wild beast, jerking half the local citizens from sleep.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Over the following two weeks, a waterfall appeared and became a major tourist attraction.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Removing fallen rocks from the river took over four months.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The cause of it all—whether deliberate or the result of a miscalculation—was apparently the irresponsible actions of the quarrying company at the tangerine grove entrance.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Ignoring their allotted boundaries, they had tunneled into the neighboring territory, destroying essential walls and pillars on the way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Seen from Kabuto City on the opposite bank, a portion of the tunnel is recognizable under a canopy of ferns and ivy, but the waterstone, which weathers quickly, has faded into an inconspicuous dirt-black.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Through a pair of powerful binoculars you can see rubble lying scattered all around like the aftermath of a bombing raid—and mixed in with it, clear signs of human habitation: tin cans, empty cigarette packs, tissue paper stuck to the ground like jellyfish, comic books, and what look like dried, used condoms.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".“There’s definitely more than two,” repeated Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“And the skirmishing has gone on three full days now.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s time for a decisive battle—right around tonight.”“But your leader is dead,” said the girl, holding her nose and shrinking back as if suddenly remembering the body.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Who’s fighting whom?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Who were those two guys running away from in such a hurry?”“The leadership may change, but not the strategy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The old men are very keen on their strategy.” Something in Sengoku’s way of speaking was terribly disturbing.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It made me think of a fishing barb wrapped skillfully in bait.“How ridiculous,” sighed the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Who gives a damn?” He looked from me to the sheeted bundle and back again.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Maybe we should go ahead and call a doctor,” he said.Sengoku burst into loud, jeering guffaws.“What’s so funny?” demanded the shill.“I was just thinking you wouldn’t talk that way if you knew what the war was all about.”“I’m talking about a doctor.”“No doctors make house calls at this hour, and you know it.”“All right, I give up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What is the war about?”“Oh, you’d be interested, I guarantee.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’d even bet on it.”“Of course he would,” snapped the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then, reverting to her professional smile, she added more graciously, “After all, that’s his job.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His and mine.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It has nothing to do with our real feelings.Don’t forget, we’re sakura.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Decoys.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Shills.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Our job is showing interest to attract customers.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Anytime we can be of service, just give us a call.”“I must say I don’t think you have the proper attitude,” said Sengoku, puffing himself up self-importantly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“When some problem arises, you’ve got to try to understand the other fellow’s point of view—isn’t that the basis of communal living?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Before I express any doubts to the captain, I always think back on all the sweet-potato cakes of mine he’s bought and try to figure out what went wrong.”“Bully for you.” The shill sucked in his saliva and clucked his tongue.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Sorry if our line of work offends you.”“I—I didn’t mean it like that.” Sengoku stumbled over his words as if he’d lost his bearings.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I mean—I’ve worked in election campaigns, and that’s pretty much the same thing, isn’t it?”“What are you trying to say?”“That cleaning up humanity is part of the Broom Brigade’s business.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Also that the kids in the Wild Boar Stew gang are real punks, the lowest of the low.”“The what, did you say?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Wild Boar Stew gang?”“That’s right.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Clever, don’t you think?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s apparently deliberate provocation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Because the men in the Broom Brigade go around puncturing the tires of their cars.”“Komono isn’t going to go for any war like that,” I argued, rubbing the back of my knee.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“No way.” Even if he was a former SDF man, in love with firearms, at heart Komono was a selfish cynic who believed in nothing but quick, sure profits.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Nobody in search of everlasting hope could possibly succeed as a showman like him.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Still, you know, if he ever did catch one of them .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“Don’t forget, Komono’s got a gold-plated badge with three stripes,” said Sengoku.“Yes,” said the shill, “and he issues commands like the real thing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’s probably humoring the old men.”“No, he’s serious, I think,” I said.“Don’t be silly,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“What is there to worry about?”“I can’t help it.”“Even granting the Wild Boar Stew gang is the dregs of humanity—absolute scum—there still isn’t much to choose between them and the old men in the Broom Brigade.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Anyway, basically I don’t believe in dividing people into trash and nontrash.Evolution taught me that much.” He gave a quick self-deprecating smile, and added, “Garbage is the fertilizer that makes the trees grow.”Again my leg began to throb painfully in time to the beat of my pulse.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had a presentiment of terrible pain, as if my skin were to be slashed with a knife.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A dangerous sign.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Even a person who normally can’t stand dentists will head straight for one as soon as his toothache gets bad enough.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You get so you wouldn’t care if he used pliers to take it out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At this rate, I feared I might soon start begging them to cut my leg off.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I addressed the shill.“If anything should happen to me, I guess you’d make the best successor as captain,” I said.“Me?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Captain?” The shill’s face froze in the beginnings of a laugh.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You sure you haven’t got me mixed up with somebody else?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If I were the captain, this would be the S.S. Sakura—a shill ship.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What a laugh!,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No compass, no charts.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just a ship that pretends to be going somewhere, when all along it has no intention of moving an inch.”“I never had a compass, either, you know.” My leg continued to swell.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If you could catch one of those hoodlums, though, I sure would like to question him about a tunnel leading up under here.”“I’ll bet they’re still around, those two—maybe just outside.” The girl supported the crossbow with her knee, and laid her fingers on the bow.“It’s probably hopeless,” said Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“They couldn’t know very much about the quarry layout.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s only the last two or three days they came in this far, running away from their pursuers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".Funny thing is, the Broom Brigade was really after junior high school girls the whole time.”“I beg your pardon?” I asked.“You heard me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Junior high school girls.”22THE SHADOW ADJUTANTWe stared at the steel door over the landing.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The girl was standing three paces in front of the toilet, crossbow at the ready; the shill was at the foot of the staircase, hand on the pillar, frozen halfway to a sitting position; Sengoku was leaning against the wall that connected with the galley.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Each of us pondered separately the possible meaning of that striking remark about junior high school girls.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We all sensed the importance of understanding it, in order to catch the youths cowering behind the door.That was why when a figure appeared in the tunnel to the operation hold, nobody noticed until he spoke up.“Excuse me,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His manner of speaking and his attitude were different from those of the other two, yet he was unmistakably one of them.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Half of his teased hair was dyed yellow, and he looked like a dead branch soaked in oil.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Swiftly the girl repositioned her crossbow, as Dead Branch gave the interior of the hold a nervous once-over.“Excuse me,” he repeated, this time with a bow and a salute in the direction of Sengoku, whom he clearly recognized.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Sengoku acknowledged the greeting with an annoyed wave of the hand and said, “What are you doing here?”“Excuse me,” Dead Branch said again.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What set him apart from the Wild Boar Stew gang was the small bamboo broom in his right hand, and the silver badge on his chest.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He drew out the antenna on a large walkie-talkie slung around his left shoulder, and called: “Headquarters, come in.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

Over and out.”“Calling Komono?” asked the girl.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She lowered her crossbow and made a sucking sound, as if rolling a pill on her tongue.“Commander Komono is on his way here now.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He’ll be here very shortly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He’s going to set up mobile headquarters in this room.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m to wait here for him.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Excuse me.” His peculiar way of accenting every sentence was typical of his generation, yet his expression and demeanor were as flat as those of a tired old man.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Not even my queer predicament elicited any sign of interest or surprise.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was he playing the part of a modern, callous youth, or had constant association with old men turned him into a fossil?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Or perhaps he was a very model of allegiance—the sort who gave constant obedience, even in the absence of a command.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was no denying that he inspired a certain dread.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Yet now he leaped nimbly up onto the first storage drum and seated himself, swinging his legs and beating out a rhythm with the handle of his broom.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Surely he wasn’t humming an old war song .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"?“Get a load of him,” muttered the shill.“He’s a spy,” said Sengoku, loud enough for the youth to hear.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“He was a member of the Wild Boar Stew gang till just a few days ago.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Inototsu paid him to keep us informed.” He turned to the youth.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Isn’t that so?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Why don’t you say something?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’re the one who dragged junior high school girls into it, aren’t you?” The youth shot him a wordless glance, his face a mask.The girl turned around and asked Sengoku, “What’s all this about junior high school girls?”“Ask Komono,” he said.“It’s nothing for a woman to be concerned about,” said the youth in a crisp and businesslike tone.“Watch what you say, kid, or I’ll let you have it,” she warned, crouching with her finger on the trigger.He was unfazed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Very impressive.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But your panties are showing.”“You idiot!” yelled the shill.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“She means it!” He scooped up the surveying scrapbook from the floor by the toilet and hurled it at the girl.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It grazed her shoulder and fell on the sight of the crossbow, knocking the arrow off course so that it glanced loudly against the drum and ricocheted up to the ceiling.“What did you do that for!” cried the girl, jumping up.The shill strode past her to the youth, and slapped him in the face.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The youth leaped to the floor and raised his broom threateningly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“What’s the big idea?” he snarled.“I’ll tell you the big idea, pal.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You owe me a little gratitude.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I just saved your life.”Slowly the youth relaxed; then he began to fidget in evident embarrassment.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Uh, excuse me.”“All right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s more like it.”“Horrid little person,” said the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She held out her crossbow and the shill took it, drawing the bow to the full.Sengoku, in apparent shock, pulled away from the wall, stiff with amazement; I, however, could guess what was going on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It had to be some sort of a trick by these two con artists.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They had carried it off magnificently; the tables were entirely turned.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Now was my chance to ask my question.“There’s some kind of engine room under here, isn’t there?” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You know about it, don’t you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Tell me how to get there.” For the first time, the youth looked straight at me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His eyes dropped to the toilet, then rose again to my face.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“What are you doing?” he asked.“Never mind,” said the girl, fitting another arrow to the taut bow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Answer the captain.”“We’ve had nothing to go on but copies of the sketches.”“What sketches?”With his broom handle the youth pointed to my scrapbook, lying on the floor where the shill had thrown it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The girl picked it up, smoothed the pages, and returned it to me.“How do you know about this?”“I borrowed it from that shelf and got it copied at a bookstore in town.”A double blow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"First the humiliation of having been hoodwinked by a pup like him, all the while I went on foolishly believing the scrapbook was my private secret.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As if that weren’t enough, this destroyed my last hope of escaping by adjusting the mechanism in the pipes from below.“But you people are holed up at the old tunnel site out by Kabuto Bridge, aren’t you?” I said in desperation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It’s got to connect out there.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Try to remember if there’s a tunnel leading down in.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There’s got to be.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s the only explanation.”“Leading down under here, you mean?”“Yes, exactly beneath here.”“Then maybe that’s where .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“Does it ring a bell?”“Isn’t there someplace you might have overlooked?” he said.“Come on, tell me,” I begged.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“At least give me a hint.”“Down by the Kabuto Bridge entrance—the cave in the cliff facing Kabuto River, that is, on the east .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I suppose you know there was a big cave-in there once.”“Yes,” I said.“Well, that cave comes to a dead end barely ten yards in.”“That can’t be,” I protested.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Then how do you know there’s a room under here?”“You just told me there was.”“But you said I’d overlooked something.”“How the hell else do you explain it?”The girl re-aimed her crossbow, planting her feet firmly.“Watch the way you talk.”“Excuse me.” He went on, his face still devoid of expression.“Actually we’d like to know too.”Sengoku interrupted in seeming irritation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“That could be true.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I know they’re out looking.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All fifteen or so of the girls have disappeared.”“Huh?” The shill swallowed noisily.“You baited the tangerine grove entrance somehow, and lured them in from there, was that it?” Sengoku said casually.“We gathered up runaways and brought them here,” the youth declared, speaking for the first time with youthful enthusiasm.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“We’re not spying on you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We just wanted to do our own thing without any interference from adults.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We were going to make our own village and settle down.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So we negotiated with Mr.Inototsu, the head of the Broom Brigade, and paid some money and got a share of the rights to this place.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We’ve got a perfect right to be here.”“I don’t know what to make of this, do you?” said the shill, an eye on Sengoku’s face.“Quit making excuses,” said Sengoku with a jumpy laugh.“You tricked those girls into coming here, and then you had the Broom Brigade attack—admit it.”“No.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Somebody was waiting for us in ambush,” said the youth.“Who?”“The pig here and his men.”The shill ambled forward.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Now you’ve gone too far.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Look here, you—”“Never mind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Let him finish,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
At last I was beginning to see.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The Wild Boar Stew gang, having been attacked, must have escaped through the dark maze of tunnels.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
In the process they had gotten separated and some—including all the junior high school girls—were lost.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Their whereabouts were a matter of immediate consequence to me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This was nothing I could close my eyes to.Addressing the youth, I said, “Until now the only one living here was me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The other three all just came on board today.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You can ask Komono.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I couldn’t attack you all by myself, now could I?”“But we were attacked.”“Yes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"By the Broom Brigade.”“No, they were there to protect us.”“What an idiot!” shouted Sengoku, swinging his two arms before him, hands clasped.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I’ve never seen anything like it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve known plenty of liars, but here’s a guy who can’t face the truth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If what you say is true,” he went on, “why did everybody but you run away from them?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Don’t talk nonsense.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You knew there was only one person here.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You knew everything.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’s because you’re a spy.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Can you get that into your head?”Suddenly the youth burst into tears.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He pressed his forehead against the broom handle and sobbed, his shoulders heaving.“Fool.” The girl lowered her crossbow and went back to the stairs.“Try to remember,” I urged.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Where did you lose sight of the girls?” The maggots in my calf were as large as earthworms.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I doubted my ability to remain sane through the next attack, whenever it might come.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As soon as the worms sprouted legs and changed into scorpions or centipedes, it would be all over.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If it came to that, I’d rather have them cut the damn leg off.There was the echo of footsteps, their approach heightened by perspective.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This time it was the insect dealer, as I could tell from the shadow of a massive round head in the doorway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He halted just before coming into view, and said in a rich, commanding voice:“Very good.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Two men remain here, and the rest of you go join the search squad.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That’ll be all.”Was this really the insect dealer?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Of course it was.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I breathed easier when he stepped into sight.“That took long enough,” said the shill cheerfully, with undisguised relief.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was he relying on Komono, after all?“Yes, I got held up—”“Excuse me, sir!” The youth stopped crying, held his broom up at his side like a musket, and clicked his heels together.“Who’re you?” asked the insect dealer.“That’s Scout A, sir,” said a deep, husky voice, and at the same time a shadowy figure, that of an old man, appeared behind the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He seemed less a man than a man-shaped hole in space.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He was still in his sixties, broad in the shoulder, with an erect posture.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His dark blue uniform looked too short for him.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The end of his bamboo broom, which he held tucked under his arm upside down, shone darkly, as if it had a steel core.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It looked like a lethal weapon.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Slung across his other shoulder was a large canvas bag.“Ah, yes, that’s right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I remember.” The insect dealer nodded slightly, held out a hand indicating the shadowlike old man (whose dark complexion nearly matched the color of his uniform), and introduced him to us.“My adjutant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’s had a long and distinguished career under my predecessor.”“How do you do,” said the shadow, with a deep bow.Leaving his scout and his adjutant there, the insect dealer slowly advanced.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He seemed to be stalling for time in order to decide what questions to ask first.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Mysteriously, neither he nor the shadow was the least bit wet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If they had come by way of the tangerine grove entrance, they must have crossed that underground river somehow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Come to think of it, the young hoodlums were all dry too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Why?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was I the only one who didn’t know my way around?The insect dealer looked from me to the toilet and back again.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then he compared me with the plastic-wrapped body.Finally he looked around at the other three.“The situation’s gotten a bit out of hand,” he said, indicating the body with a jerk of his head.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“What do you think, Captain?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"From your point of view this is a calamity, isn’t it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After all, you’ve lost a close family member.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Or is it more in the nature of a minor inconvenience?”“It’s no calamity,” I snorted.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“As you know damn well.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll admit it’s sobering—any dead body is.”“The problem with the toilet is a calamity, though, isn’t it?” he pursued.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Don’t tell me you’re just out to protest disposing of the body.”“Look at him!” said the girl.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Can’t you see he’s in trouble?”“Well, yes.”“What are we going to do?” said Sengoku, fear in his voice.“He’s in there as tight as a cork in a bottle.”“I’m getting sick of this,” said the shill, rubbing his arms vigorously.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Too many damned complications.”“You can say that again,” said the insect dealer, looking from me to the body and back again.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He scratched the wing of his nose.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I thought the job was important for a lot of reasons, and I’ve worked it out with the members of the Broom Brigade .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"but I guess the captain’s leg comes first.”“You know, I’ve been thinking, and it seems to me there are two possibilities.” The girl spoke quietly, looking around cautiously to check everybody’s reactions.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She was right—it needed to be said quietly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I could read her thoughts as clearly as if they were my own.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She was also right about there being two alternatives.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But how to choose between them?“I think so too.” Surprisingly, the shill quickly agreed.“In principle, so do I.” Even Sengoku was getting in the act.Had all four of us reached the same conclusion?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was it so clear and inescapable as that, like a straight road with no turnings?The insect dealer rolled up his sleeping bag by the stairs and sat down on it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Let’s hear it, then.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If this is unanimous, it must be brilliant.”Nobody wants to be the one to bell the cat.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Finally the girl spoke up, smiling innocently.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Well, simply put, one way is to smash the toilet, and the other is to find the engine room below and adjust the valves to eliminate the pressure.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Isn’t that so?”“Makes sense.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”“But each plan has its flaw.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If we break the toilet, we can’t dispose of the body until it’s repaired.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And to find the engine room, we’ve got to track down the hiding place of those missing junior high school girls.”“How’s that?”“Well, the captain figures that since neither place has come to light in any survey to date, there must be some connection.”“I see.”The adjutant, standing by in the tunnel, called out his opinion.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I know how you can kill two birds with one stone—or serve two ends at the same time.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Excuse me, Captain, I ought to offer you my formal condolences, but allow me to defer that for the moment.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"First I should like to say that speaking in my official capacity, I recommend the latter course—tracking the missing persons.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For years, under the leadership of Commander Inototsu, we in the Broom Brigade dreamed of the establishment of an independent self-governing old people’s paradise.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Only we never call it that.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To us the word ‘old’ is discriminatory, so it’s officially banned.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Here, as in all things, Commander Inototsu was uncompromising.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We use the word ‘castoffs’ instead.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Strictly speaking, the concept of castoffs has no age limits; but since the aging process generally brings on a degree of physical decrepitude, with no hope of reversal, and since aging is the universal fate of mankind, in our dictionary people of advanced age are known as‘quintessential castoffs’ and the facilities we are planning to build we call the Kingdom of Quintessential Castoffs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Fortunately, the day when our dream becomes reality is not far off.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Hellfire of uranium and plutonium will rain from the sky, and that will be the start of the apocalypse—or what Sengoku over there calls the New Beginning.”“Listen to him!” marveled the girl, speaking softly.“This guy’s a real pro,” muttered the shill.“.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Listen, can’t you hear?” the shadow adjutant went on.“The whole world is weeping with loud lamentation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The world weeps at the picture books of happy homes, and at TVcommercials for wedding palaces, as it takes part in drunken medleys in bars and dives.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We quintessential castoffs can hear every wail.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Never let it be said that Commander Inototsu died in vain.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Commander Komono, Captain—please lead us.” The shadow adjutant unzipped the canvas bag at his side and took out something resembling a half-rotten cabbage.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Holding it up with reverence, he marched forward ceremoniously.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Stepping directly in front of me, he held it out as if presenting me with a special award.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was the old green hunting cap that had been Inototsu’s trademark.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shadow bowed his head and said unctuously:“Please accept this remembrance of your esteemed father.We sincerely hope you will overcome your present sorrow, in order to carry on his great work and see it through to completion.” I could hardly bear to touch the thing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It symbolized the essence of all that I hated about Inototsu; it was the materialization of his stench.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But I couldn’t very well refuse it, either; that’s a ceremony for you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This oily-smooth old man might possibly forgive me if I handled the cap with disrespect, but never if I ignored the ceremony.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer beside him was silent, without a trace of a smile on his lips.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This was not only because they had just met, I felt sure, but because he too had sensed the core of madness lurking inside his adjutant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As he stepped back, the shadow peered inside the toilet.“What an unfortunate disaster,” he concurred.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then he turned to the insect dealer, leaning on his broom as on a cane, and addressed him with compelling politeness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“What do you say, sir, to calling back all the cleaning squads and having them join in a search for the lost little females?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I daresay it would be good for morale.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not only could we be of service to the captain, but you see this is a question that bears directly on the fate of the Kingdom of Quintessential Castoffs as well.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When the world is destroyed in hellfire, even if we survive, unless we leave descendants our survival is in vain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We would be letting society down.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, like bamboo, which flowers and bears fruit just before it withers and dies, most quintessential castoffs still have sexual prowess.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And as has been scientifically proven, they are still fully capable of fathering children.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In fact, they’d rather do that than eat.”“Hey, that goes against the agreement!” cried the youth in an unhappy voice, his body stiff.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You promised you wouldn’t lay a finger on them!”“And we won’t.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’ll be a different part of the anatomy altogether.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Now what are you going to do about it?” The adjutant stood stiffly erect and banged the floor with his broom handle.There was a metallic clang.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If you expect us to share them with you, then I’d advise you to show respect for your elders.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Respect, do you hear me?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or would you like to have this taken up in court?Speak up.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’ve been told how to answer when spoken to, haven’t you?” His turn of speech reminded me of Inototsu.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer had dropped his eyes to the floor and was scratching himself behind the ear; he seemed to be struggling to maintain a disinterested expression.“He’s something, isn’t he?” whispered the girl, and bit her lip.“Isn’t he, though.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He’ll be a cinch to work for,” agreed the shill.After some hesitation, the youth straightened himself and sang out, his face expressionless, “Excuse me, sir!”“That’s more like it.”“I see.” The insect dealer nodded his large head and thrust his hands in his pants pockets.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“But the final judgment will depend on the captain.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And we’ve got to consider his limits of endurance.”“Yes, that’s right,” the girl responded at once, firmly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“We can’t rely on that search; it’s too chancy.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The captain started going out of his mind just a little while ago.”“How would we break the toilet?”“There’s a vacuum inside, so all you have to do is open a hole in the pipe and let air in.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Break the concrete about eight inches down.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”“I see—it’s a question of odds.” The insect dealer plucked a gold-plated badge out of his pocket.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“What do you say, folks?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"These carry a lot of weight around town in the entertainment districts, especially the gold-plated ones.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”No one reached out a hand.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The adjutant repeated, “Shall I send out an order to the cleaning squads outside, ordering them to return immediately and join the search squad?” The shill, his voice like bubbles from a washcloth squeezed underwater, murmured, “So that’s it .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"a dozen or so junior high school girls, and dozens and dozens of old men.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“I won’t stand for it,” fumed Sengoku.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“No way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even if the New Beginning comes, and we alone survive, those girls must be guaranteed the right to choose their own partners.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll recommend that this be adopted as a central article in the bylaws.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Who does he think he is?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Little females indeed!,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If that’s the way he’s going to talk, I hereby withdraw all cooperation.”There were several seconds of silence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then the youth whispered, “It goes against the agreement.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It wasn’t supposed to be like this, not at all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“How about it, Captain—about how many more hours do you think you can hold out?” The insect dealer propped up both elbows on his sleeping bag and smiled at me, fondling his badge.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was the very expression he had worn when I stopped the jeep and he came back with the fish sticks.“I have only one question,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You and the others came by way of the tangerine grove, didn’t you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So why aren’t you wet?Your clothes, your hair, anything .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“That’s right,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I’ve been thinking the same thing.”“We came by boat.” The adjutant smiled faintly.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“A rubber boat.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Couldn’t manage without it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You mean you didn’t know?It’s stuck in below the ceiling on the eastern side near the floodgate, where the ceiling comes down nearly to water level.Help yourself anytime.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You lie face up in the bottom and push against the ceiling with your hands and feet.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Only fifteen feet or so from there, you come to a stairway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To pull the boat toward you, use the rope attached to a pulley under the ceiling there by the floodgate.”I could say nothing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His all-too-practical explanation shattered my frail hopes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was no hidden passageway.“A third alternative does exist,” said the insect dealer, “but it probably wouldn’t appeal to you.” He rubbed a badge on his leg, and pinned it on his chest.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I mean amputating your leg.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Logically speaking, it is another possibility, that’s all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I just thought I’d mention it.”“We’re wasting time, Commander,” said the adjutant.“Inototsu would have issued orders long ago.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He knew how to handle people.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How do you expect to win the men over if you can’t even stir them to action over the little females?” He stepped up to the toilet.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I braced myself, but he seemed to have no intention of hurting me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He picked up the green hunting cap of Inototsu’s, which I had let fall unawares, brushed it off (though the cap itself was far dirtier than any dirt it might have picked up), walked across the hold, and laid it carefully on the blue plastic sheet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Bringing his palms together, he then clapped his hands solemnly—whether in Shinto style or Buddhist I couldn’t tell, nor did it seem to matter.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even from behind he looked like a hole in space.“All right, then—I’ll give an order.” The insect dealer got up.“Does anybody know a doctor?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He needn’t work exclusively for the Broom Brigade, but it ought to be someone we could rely on in an emergency.”“I know one, but he’s an ob-gyn man,” replied the shadow adjutant, in apparent discomfort.“What are you going to do?” I asked.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My mouth was dry, and yet I wanted to urinate again.“The specialty doesn’t matter.” The insect dealer held up his hands, effectively shutting off further discussion.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If he can’t make house calls, let him at least provide us with some drugs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A good strong sedative, not some over-the-counter kind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Something potent, like morphine.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Can he do it?”“I suppose so.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If he doesn’t have to do it very often.”“And we’ll need sleeping pills, and antibiotics.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Send out the order on the double.”“What about calling in the cleaning squads?” the shadow adjutant reminded him.“I leave that to your judgment.”23“I WANT TO SEE THE SKY”“If only I could see the sky,” sighed the girl forlornly.“It’s still the middle of the night,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The throb of pain in my leg was strange; it didn’t match my heartbeat.“Tomorrow, then.”“You want to get out of here?”“Very much.”Casually, while pretending to wash the galley sink, she picked up my Uzi and stood it against the side of the toilet, where I could reach out and get it without twisting my knee.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was she concerned about my safety?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was true that the situation was growing tenser by the moment.The adjutant returned from the work hold, apparently having finished relaying commands.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He struck the floor with his broom handle and barked an order at the youth.“Scout A!”“Excuse me, sir.”“Bring down a table and chair from upstairs.”“Yes, sir.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A table and chair from upstairs.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Right away, sir.”“The hell you will,” I yelled, turning to the insect dealer and the shill for support.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill and the girl responded quickly: he planted himself at the foot of the stairs, blocking the way up, while she released the safety catch on the crossbow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer only shook his head at the youth, restraining him passively.I still wasn’t accustomed to the new distribution of power.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Of them all, Sengoku, who only gave a deep sigh, may well have been most sympathetic to me.“May I ask why not?” The adjutant seemed less disgruntled than surprised.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I should like to take this opportunity to explain several important daily procedures to our new commander.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For him to be able to look through the necessary papers, we will need a table and chair.”“I don’t care what the reason is,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Nobody goes up there without my permission.”“Then you will please give us your permission.”“Oh, I don’t think we need to get so touchy, do we?” said the insect dealer, mollifying the adjutant and me with a broad smile as he spread out his sleeping bag.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“This’ll do fine for now.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll imagine I’m out on a picnic, enjoying the cherry blossoms at night.” The shill smiled—perhaps a professional reflex—as he watched the adjutant pull various articles from his canvas bag and arrange them across the sleeping bag.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was exactly like an outdoor stall, without the need for capital investment.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Not even the insect dealer could suppress a small smile.The girl sat on the bottom step of the staircase, and the shill settled himself three steps higher, leaning against the banister as he looked down.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer sat cross-legged by the wall on the bridge side; even Sengoku came around by the toilet for a peek.I, of course, had the best view of all from my vantage point atop the toilet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Only the youthful scout remained sulking beside the storage drums.The state of my leg grew more and more disquieting.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had a violent chill, as if the symptoms were spreading throughout my body.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Intellectually, my mind rejected the idea, yet somehow I seemed to be waiting for drugs from the doctor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Never mind antibiotics, I thought—get me morphine!The adjutant spread out his items, conspicuous among them a telephone directory.“What am I supposed to do with a phone book?” queried the insect dealer, a look of incomprehension on his face.“We’ll use it later, in the trial.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll explain everything in due course.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“So the commander just listens to explanations, and has no final say?”“Nothing of the kind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But I should advise against too-sudden changes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Customs that the entire brigade grows used to become almost physically a part of them.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Casting doubt on established customs would be to no one’s advantage.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Pride in being part of the brigade is inseparable from a spirit of submission.”“Where’d you get all that?”“Can’t you guess?” The shadow man laughed for the first time.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was a colorless laugh, neither sarcastic nor amused.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I used to be active in politics.”“Politics is interesting, I’ll grant you that.”“Nothing more so—as long as you’re on the side in power.And as long as you’re willing to live with the fear of losing that power, there’s no greater pleasure in the world than to know the country is safely in your hands.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Commander Inototsu was a fortunate man.“The country?” repeated the insect dealer.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You’re only talking about the Kingdom of Quintessential Castoffs.”“Don’t talk foolishly about things you don’t understand.” The shadow launched into a speech.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“The value of a country has nothing to do with its size or wealth: the only trick is getting other countries to recognize it in accordance with international law.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As long as they do that, even a tiny country no bigger than the palm of your hand is a sovereign nation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Do you know what that means?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There is no greater power on earth.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Backed by that power, whatever you do—kill, steal, get rich and fat off confidence games—you can never be arrested or imprisoned.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Criticized, yes; fined, no.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This is the century of the sovereign nation, absolutely.”“He’s funny, isn’t he?” said the insect dealer, glancing around the room as if testing everyone’s reactions.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
For a second his eyes grew thoughtful.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then he said, “But it’s all a pipe dream.Whatever you say or do, nobody’s going to recognize the Kingdom of Quintessential Castoffs as a sovereign nation.”“Ah, you don’t understand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Or no, forgive me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You mustn’t forget that we’re entering the age of the apocalypse—the New Beginning.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When that time comes, everyone can just grant himself recognition.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It will be a brand-new era.”“So you’re another one who thinks nuclear war is inevitable?”“Absolutely.”“So do I.” I couldn’t help speaking up, despite a teeth-clenching chill.“Do you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Why?” The adjutant did not seem especially pleased with the appearance of a fellow believer.“Because once they discover a weapon so powerful that the first one to use it will automatically win—which is what everyone is racing to discover—I find it hard to believe they’d hesitate to put it into use.”“Very perceptive.” For a moment I felt as if the shadow had opened his shadow eyes to reveal another set of eyes, deeper within.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“But more important, even supposing a state succumbs to a virulent infectious disease, there is no way to force it to undergo a cure.”“Then there’s no hope,” wailed Sengoku.“That only makes it more interesting, you might say,” said the adjutant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Imagine yourself a witness to Genesis, Chapter One.What greater thrill could there be?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s real nation-building.”“But kingdoms aren’t for me,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I told Komono that before—monarchies and dictatorships are not my style.” The sense of swelling had spread up past my knee, until now the weight of my body on that leg was hardly bearable.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I longed to sit down, even for a moment.“It’s all one and the same.” The adjutant rearranged the telephone directories and sheafs of paper scattered on the sleeping bag, as if in accordance with some fundamental law.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You’re talking about democratization, Captain, if I’m not mistaken.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That, believe me, is a mere expedient the state was forced to adopt in order to increase individual production efficiency.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s no different from expanding the freedom of a terminal in order to increase computer efficiency.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After all, every form of democracy places limits on the freedom to commit treason or acts of a similar nature.”“But there’s the right to self-defense.”“Certainly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What guarantees it, however, is again the state.There are two kinds of national defense: external defense, to protect against meddling from without, and internal defense, to protect against treason or rebellion from within.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Hence the two great pillars of any state are its army and its police.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There can be no state in which the domination principle fails to function.Whoever is in control, issuance of passports goes right on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But what of it—all we’re concerned with for the time being is the Kingdom of Quintessential Castoffs, after all.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"‘Kingdom’ in this case is merely a manner of speaking, you understand, used to suggest an ideal realm isolated from the rest of the world.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As far as concrete policy decisions are concerned, I personally intend to leave everything in your hands, Commander—or the captain’s.” Instinctively the insect dealer and I exchanged glances.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The shadow had succeeded brilliantly in driving a wedge between us.The suggestive phrasing effectively underscored his own position as well.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This guy was some humbug.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I felt as if I’d once had a dream like this; it was the sort of scene that had probably been inevitable once I started selling tickets to survival in earnest.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A haunted shrine in a forest holds no terrors if you run past it looking the other way, I had told myself, but such was not to be.This, undoubtedly, was the reality of survival.“Who am I working for?” said the shill tiredly, shifting his position.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After sitting on stone that long, his bottom probably hurt—though whatever exhaustion he felt could be nothing compared to mine.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I’m losing my grasp of things.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Whose side am I supposed to be on?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Who’s hiring me?”“I’ll hire you,” I offered.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I needed every friend I could get.Besides, there was something I wanted him to do for me.“And what are you trying to sell?” he asked.“You know what it is, don’t you?” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“My position.Anyway, never mind that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Would you please bring down the encyclopedia in the bookcase upstairs?”“Just tell me what you want to know.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll look it up for you.”“No—I want to pile it up and sit on it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My knee can’t hold me up much longer.”“Five or six volumes enough?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Seven would do it for sure, I guess,” he said, and trotted up the stairs.The adjutant opened a large notepad and drew a line with a felt pen.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He marked it off at regular intervals, adding numbers.“Excuse me, sir.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Allow me to explain briefly the daily routine.Work ends at 0430 hours.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then showers and baths, then chorus.”“Chorus means the martial songs,” stuck in Sengoku.“That’s right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You know—‘Here we bide, hundreds of miles from home, in far-off Manchuria .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.’ ”“I don’t like it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Too jaded,” said the insect dealer, shaking his head.“It’s a good song for quintessential castoffs,” said the shadow.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It expresses so well the heartfelt sadness of soldiers forced to die meaningless deaths.”“It’s sad, all right—especially the part that goes: ‘My friend lies ’neath a stone in yonder empty field.’ ”“Ah, but that’s not the line that gets to them the most.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s‘tears in my eyes.’ That’s the one place where they manage to sing in perfect unison.”“Same difference.”“At 0500 hours, everyone assembles in the mess hall.”“Where’s that?”“Starting today we’ll be using room number two, next door to here.”“Oh, you think so, do you?” I expostulated.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Who the hell said you could do that?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Who do you guys think you are, anyway?”“But the construction squad has already started transporting food and materials.”“Look, Komono,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Just because you’re the new head of the Broom Brigade doesn’t mean you can do things like that.”“Is it out of the question?” asked the adjutant, and went on swiftly in a well-rehearsed tone.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Oh, well, we could always switch to room number three, above the lift; about eighty percent of the items have been moved that far already.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All the men are anxious to join the search squad in looking for the junior high school girls as quickly as possible.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It has a direct bearing on morale.”“Captain, would you mind leaving this up to me?” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It seems to me that in the middle of a confusing situation, changing everything around is only going to compound the confusion.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m doing my best to work things out to everybody’s satisfaction.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”Having anticipated a more convincing argument in his old, flowing style, I felt vaguely disappointed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If this was how he stood up to the adjutant, I feared the worst.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"How had he managed to secure the position of commander in so short a time, anyway?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If it was solely by virtue of having shot and killed Inototsu, then they were no better than a pack of monkeys.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To push Komono any further might only be playing into the adjutant’s hands.Just then the shill came down the stairs, carrying the encyclopedia volumes piled on his shoulder.“Besides,” I said, “I’ll have you know the room next door isn’t room number two, anyway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It has a proper name—the work hold.”“I beg your pardon.”The girl and the shill together piled up the volumes catty-corner behind the toilet, adjusting them to the proper height.Sengoku held me under the arms, helping me to sit down without putting any additional strain on my knee.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Once I had endured a pain rather like that of stretching a sprained muscle, I did feel more comfortable.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A wreath of mist swirled lightly around inside my head, like drowsiness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In my knee and the arch of my foot, it was as if electrodes had been implanted, sending out electrical current in rhythmic pulses.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Slowly, very slowly, the current was gaining in strength.“It won’t be long now,” said the adjutant, crinkling his eyes; the wrinkles in the corners looked as if they’d been pasted on.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"His shadowy existence was gradually fleshing out, beginning steadily to fill its proper share of space.“Drugs may ease the pain, but they won’t solve the problem,” I said.“For now at least let’s ease the pain,” said the insect dealer, with a wave and a smile.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“That encyclopedia was a clever idea.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It must feel a little better anyway, with your weight off the leg.”“If he suggests knocking me out with drugs and then cutting off the leg,” I said, looking first into the shill’s eyes and then into the girl’s, and finally resting my gaze on Sengoku, “I want you to protect me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Don’t let them lay a finger on me, do you hear?”The insect dealer turned till he was facing me directly and said, “Captain, watch your manners, if you don’t mind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’re going too far.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Please be more discreet.”“You’re responsible.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What do you mean, the SDF was a disappointment?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You seem to be enjoying yourself, all right, the way you snap out those commands.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“You know, it surprises even me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m not lying, either.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
(I only do that for pay.),Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s a fact: there’s all the difference in the world between getting orders and giving them.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s like the difference between the steering wheel and the driver.”“I want to see the sky,” said the girl, between sips of water over at the sink.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Her voice was a monotone, like that of a child reading from a textbook.“I still say that owning your own country is the greatest luxury there is.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Excuse me, sir.” The adjutant’s pencil struck the third point on the line he had drawn on his notepad.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Breakfast begins with recitation of the Broom Brigade oath: ‘I pledge to sweep away all trash blocking the way ahead.’ This morning—at this time of year the sun must be about ready to come up; it must be morning by now—I’d like to include some time for silent prayer in memory of Commander Inototsu.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Showing the proper courtesy toward the one you felled will go far in engaging the men’s trust.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If possible, a eulogy from the captain would be—”“Don’t make me laugh.” I snorted.“Very well, I won’t insist.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Excuse me.” He continued with his litany.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“At 0545 hours, breakfast is over.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then there’s a fifteen-minute break.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"At 0600 hours, the trial begins.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s divided into two parts, the first being mutual arraignment, which involves having Broom Brigade members submit anonymous written indictments of each other.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Yes, I know what you’re going to say—but a certain amount of mutual distrust is like a shot in the arm, vital if the system is to operate smoothly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There is certainly no need to publicize all the reports; you and I can pigeonhole them if we want, Commander, or we can create our own—”“You mean trump them up, don’t you?” said the shill accusingly from the top of the stairs, shooting off the words like paper airplanes.“As you wish.”“Depressing.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"These guys are all so depressing,” lamented Sengoku.“Nonsense,” sniffed the adjutant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He sucked on a back tooth, stretching his jaws open as far as he could without opening his mouth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I suspected he had false teeth.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Let’s have no high-sounding talk.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This method is being used all over—corporations, schools, everywhere.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s called the ‘self-supervision system.’“Well, shall we proceed to part two of the trial?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This is by far the most important activity of the day .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"unless, of course, by this time the junior high school girls have been netted, in which case we may have to change plans.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m afraid the brigade members are painting a rather lurid picture of what will follow in that case—something to the effect that they will divvy them up by lots on the spot.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Extreme caution will be essential in handling the female brats, and in persuading the brigade members to exercise self-control.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No one has to participate who doesn’t want to—although I for one am looking forward to it, and the captain might just find the information he’s looking for.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"First we’ll line them up and introduce them to the brigade, and then the four of us can conduct in-depth interviews in private.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"How does that sound?”“How can you sit still and listen to this?” said Sengoku, his breath coming somewhat faster than seemed necessary.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I can’t stand it.”“Nobody’s asking you to,” remarked the adjutant, and continued.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Leaving that aside, we now come to part two of the trial, when this comes into play.” He picked up the telephone directory, which had a well-worn look, placed his hand on top, and clamped his mouth shut as if weighing the effect.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The effect was all he could have hoped for.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Having some inkling of what this was all about, I became still more depressed.“Look—isn’t he still crying?” whispered the girl over my shoulder.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The youth was standing motionless, his face buried in his arms on the storage drum.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was hard to tell; he might have been crying or he might just have dozed off.“I think gangrene is setting in,” I said.“It won’t be much longer now.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Hang on.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“I suppose it wouldn’t help if I just blasted a hole in the pipe with my Uzi.”“You’d bleed all over the place, since your leg itself is acting as the stopper,” she said.“To continue—we use this to search for the right people,” said the adjutant, picking up the directory and flipping through it.All sorts of symbols were inscribed on its pages in different colors of ink: # * % & # $ < > ¤ ¥ § O ?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“This is what we use to screen people, to determine if they are fit to survive.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We go through the whole list in alphabetical order, proceeding at a rate of about thirty names a day.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Anyone who receives a strong majority of negative votes will naturally be eliminated.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What it comes down to, really, is a death sentence.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Where there is a division of opinion, we’ll put a person on hold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There are various ranks among those on hold, and after reevaluation a person can be given a new rank, or have the sentence of death confirmed.”“What’s the standard for that evaluation?” asked the shill.“How do you propose to gather the necessary data?” I noticed appreciatively that he said nothing about his evolution-based views that human trash would make the best crew, instead taking my side—as per our agreement—and voicing my own doubts.“I can understand what deeply satisfying work it must be.” The insect dealer nodded sympathetically.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You have absolute power of life and death.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s obviously very crucial work too—after all, you’re assigning responsibility for the future of the entire human race.”“Naturally,” said the adjutant, “we use all sorts of data for reference.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Files in the city hall computer, giving fairly detailed information on family, occupation, income, and so forth, in addition to reports from private detectives, credit bureaus, and what have you.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But there is precious little time, so we have to process an average of at least thirty people a day.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No one person can be allotted more than five minutes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As a result, to expedite the process, we occasionally take into consideration gossip about the candidate, his general reputation—even the aura of his residence as seen from the outside—to help in forming a judgment.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the lack of relevant data other than the entry in the phone book, we go by our gut reaction to the candidate’s name and phone number.”“Is it possible for someone who’s innocent to receive the death sentence?” The insect dealer, sitting with his legs crossed, reversed their position.“Everyone is innocent before standing trial.”“That’s true.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I guess it’s better than throwing dice.”“Dice are no good.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That way, not enough people receive the death penalty.”“That many have to die, do they?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Well, I suppose it can’t be helped.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The number of people who can fit in here is limited.”“They’re crazy.” The girl’s voice at my ear was hoarse.“What’s the ratio of death penalties to acquittals?” the shill mumbled, barely opening his mouth; his voice too sounded weak.“There haven’t yet been any complete acquittals.” The adjutant’s voice remained perfectly calm.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Was he only putting on an act for his own amusement?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Most people get the death penalty, and the rest are on hold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There are various categories among the people on hold: retrial, pending, bail, temporary release, suspended sentence, appeal, and so forth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The case is reconsidered after new evidence or new testimony is brought in.Still, mainly it’s the death penalty.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you’ve ever visited a courtroom, perhaps you’ll understand—the greatest excitement among the quintessential castoffs in our company occurs the moment that the death penalty is announced.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That seems to be when they feel the greatest pleasure and purpose in their status as quintessential castoffs.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I do wish people would stop treating this as some sort of personality aberration.” Laying a palm on the opened telephone directory, without moving his head he looked straight at the shill and the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Sentencing people to death began as a painful means for choosing the few who would be able to survive—but at some point it became an end in itself, and a highly pleasurable one at that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Some might interpret this as the warped mentality of quintessential castoffs, I suppose.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But there’s far more to it than that.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Out of all the stories I read when I was a boy, two scenes in particular stand out in my mind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ve forgotten the rest of the plots, but those scenes are vividly etched in my mind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"One is the queen in Alice in Wonderland running around yelling, ‘Off with their heads!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Off with their heads!’ at every little thing.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The other is in one of Andersen’s fairy tales—which one, I’ve forgotten—where a young prince hiding behind a tree hands out death sentences to passing travelers and cuts them down on the spot.That’s the way it is even in the world of children—how much more so, then, among quintessential castoffs, who in a sense are condemned men (and women) granted a temporary stay of execution.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Besides, the sentences we give out can only be executed by the condemned people themselves.”Leaning back against the flushing lever, which now did nothing but wobble ineffectually, I rubbed the sides of my knee, feeling rather as if I had wet the bed and gotten soaked.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If Inototsu’s ferocity and total disregard for others were dissolved, distilled, and crystallized, they would come out resembling this adjutant’s logic.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Could I have stopped there, and repudiated his words at face value, there would have been some hope.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But the more I thought about it the less difference there was between what he was doing and what I, all unconsciously, had been doing too.How could I defend myself against the charge that my extreme reluctance to part with tickets to survival came to essentially the very same thing?Both the insect dealer and the shill had repeatedly accused me of misanthropy.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They were right.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I too had been signing secret death sentences without benefit of trial, all along.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Whose way was more cruel?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was hard to say.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In any case, I had lost all grounds for criticism of the Broom Brigade.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Instead I wanted to criticize myself, crush myself to death like a flea.“I don’t know,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It sounds inefficient to me to concentrate only on whom you can eliminate.” He snapped his fingers and banged the banister as if determined somehow to turn the tables on the adjutant.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Why not take the opposite approach, and compile lists of all the necessary trained personnel?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Doctors, nurses, computer experts, car mechanics .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".”“After the bomb, there won’t be any need for computer experts,” interrupted Sengoku with understated irony.“Electromagnetic waves will make computers useless.”“We’ve taken scrupulous pains to do just what you’re saying,” answered the adjutant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Among the brigade members are accountants, cooks, even agricultural workers.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"plus a sweet-potato-cake baker, a cameraman, and our commanding officer here, who has a very special talent: mob pacification.” The last three were apparently offered in light jest, to show off the accuracy of his information.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I was distracted, however, by the deliberate pauses before and after “butchers.” The shill spoke up defensively.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I happen to be a past master of legerdemain.”“We’ll need you, then,” said the adjutant, quietly closing the telephone book.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Because not only utility goods are necessary for survival.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Any struggle requires a dream.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Spiritual self-sufficiency is the greatest recompense of all; that’s what the trial is all about.”“I used to sell dreams,” said the insect dealer, gazing at me as if searching his way through darkness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The rest of the eupcaccias are still out in the jeep, aren’t they?”“Dreams aren’t enough, either,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“We need knives and guns .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"and toilets.” Suddenly he sprang up, shaking with tension.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then he took a deep breath and sat back down.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“In here it’s as if there wasn’t any need to sweat over money.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I suppose even outside, after the apocalypse—the New Beginning—debtors and creditors will cease to exist.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But right now, step one foot outside and they’re crawling everywhere, playing hide-and-seek with each other.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
How can it ever be any different?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"How can there ever be a New Beginning?”“We need air too,” repeated the girl vacantly.“That’s why we carried out the hunt for junior high school girls,” said the adjutant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The younger the better—don’t you agree, Commander?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Like wet paper, in a way: the time you spend slowly warming them up, before they catch fire, is the most enjoyable.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Say, that fellow’s taking an awfully long time getting back, isn’t he?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Where’s that medicine?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Let’s have the scouts check up on him, and on the progress of the search too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Commander, will you give the orders?”Nodding, the insect dealer stood up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Lightly rubbing his gold badge with the ball of his thumb, he stared intently at the youth, whose face was still buried on the storage drum, and drew a deep asthmatic-sounding breath, filling his chest with air, about to speak.Just then the steel hatch creaked open and a scream echoed.All the air the insect dealer had inhaled rushed out of him, before he could say a word.“Help, help, they’ll kill him!” It was Red Jacket, whose ear the girl had struck before.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The bleeding had apparently not stopped; the earlobe was red, and swollen to twice its previous size.He tumbled in and fell to his hands and knees on the landing.“The other guy’s being eaten alive by a pack of wild dogs!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Help!”“So that’s where you were.” The adjutant sprang up with remarkable agility, then crouched down again and moistened his forehead with spit.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Probably a charm to get rid of pins and needles in the legs; I could remember my grandmother doing the same thing long ago.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Come on down; it’s all right.”“Help him, for God’s sake—the dogs are all over him!”“Scout A, what was the meaning of that slipshod report you filed?” barked the insect dealer suddenly, straightening himself up.“You said there were no suspicious characters around here.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Isn’t he suspicious?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What have you to say?”“Excuse me, sir,” said Scout A, grinding his teeth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“No one told me he was there.”“You didn’t ask,” shot back Sengoku.“I’m partly to blame,” said the adjutant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I should have warned you that these people might not cooperate.” He walked ten paces toward the storage drums, eyes on the floor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Look—bloodstains.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was careless to have missed them.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Which one of you wounded him?”“I did.” The girl waved her crossbow aloft for him to see.“I see.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then everyone here failed to cooperate, and the scout failed in his duty.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll leave the question of discipline up to you, Commander.”“Please, you’ve gotta do something,” begged Red Jacket.“He’s being eaten alive!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"Scout, drag that young punk down here and make him tell you where he hid the girls.”“He doesn’t know where they are.” The scout’s voice had reverted to a childish squeak.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Nobody knows but the ones who ran off with them.”Red Jacket chimed in.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“If I had any idea where they were, I’d have gone along.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then this never would have happened.”“Commander, I advise against retracting an order once it’s given,” said the adjutant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He frowned, dropping his head on his chest as if he’d just realized he’d lost his wallet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He retraced his steps back over toward the toilet.“I know,” said the insect dealer, drawing a converted toy pistol from under his belt.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He cocked it, aimed it, and planted both legs firmly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Now you drag him down here, fast, and you make him talk.”Broom in hand, the young scout moved toward the landing with a resigned look.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Red Jacket rose to his knees, unfastened the chain at his belt, and gave it a shake.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Steel bit into the floorboards with a graphic sound that was somehow intensely physical: I flinched, imagining a butcher’s knife carving into bone.“Stay away,” said Red Jacket.“You get down here,” said the scout.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Do me a favor.”“No, you do me a favor.”“I’m following orders.”“Lousy traitor.”“You don’t understand.”A sharp report rang out, its echoes bouncing around the room like Ping-Pong balls.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The insect dealer had fired at the ceiling.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was a smell of gunpowder, like scorched bitter herbs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Red Jacket, wounded once already, promptly collapsed in terror.“Drag him down here.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"“Or you’ll get killed.”“I don’t know anything—and you know I don’t know!” As if his body were drained of strength, Red Jacket came sliding down the ladder, collapsing on top of the blue-sheeted bundle.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“There’s a body in there,” warned the scout, at which Red Jacket leaped up, moved several feet off, and collapsed again.“Get to work,” said the adjutant in a businesslike way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Just do as you’ve been taught.” The young scout twisted the broom handle in Red Jacket’s gut.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was a wail of pain.“You’re hurting me!”“Confess, then.”“How can I confess what I don’t know!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Aagh!”“That’s enough,” said the girl frostily, glaring at the adjutant with open hostility.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A show of indifference would have been better, I thought; the more you let others know how you really feel, the worse off you are.“I’m afraid an order, once given, can’t be retracted that easily,” said the adjutant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Bad for discipline.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As long as the men are following orders, they’re forbidden to pass any sort of judgment on those orders.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Where an order is concerned, there can be no second thoughts, period.”Red Jacket was weeping.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Covered with sweat, the young scout kept on grinding the broom handle into the victim’s belly.“If he really doesn’t know, then no amount of torture is going to get anything out of him.” The shill had covered his face in dazed disbelief, and was peeking through his fingers at the scene.“This could take time,” admitted the adjutant, his peregrination around the toilet coming to a sudden stop; he studied the insect dealer’s expression.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"“I haven’t gone mad, much as it may seem I have.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’m all right, I think.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Just wait a little longer.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’m thinking.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I know what—I’ll have a smoke.”He withdrew to a safe place and crouched against the wall; there, with the Uzi across his knees, and his own gun still in his hand, he lit a cigarette.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The young scout kept on raising and lowering his arms mechanically, as if pounding rice for rice cakes.He did seem to be letting up a little.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Red Jacket went on moaning in time to the movements of the broom; he did not appear to be taking a decisive beating.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Hundreds of barbed slugs, or some such creatures, were crawling around on the surface of my paralyzed leg.“I’m going to go take a leak,” said Sengoku, and headed for the hatch, with a sidelong look at the sheeted bundle.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"No one had any reason to stop him, and no one did: the pack of wild dogs would do that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The realization that Red Jacket’s partner had gone outside was a bit troubling—but then, it was probably true that he’d been attacked by the dogs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That would take care of him.Puffing on his cigarette, the insect dealer went into a crouch and cocked his gun.Mentally, in those few seconds I played up and down the keyboard of my brain cells, fast enough to compete in a contest, and made a decision.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I whispered to the girl, “Will you do me a favor?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Keep it secret.” My voice was so low I could barely hear it myself, but her response was instantaneous.“Yes.”“Locker number two upstairs has a switchboard inside.There’s a red lever on the left end, just at eye level.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I want you to push it up.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Will you do that?”“What’s the combination?”“Same as the locker number, two—two right, two left, two right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Just two-two-two.”“The red lever.”“Nothing will happen right away.”For safety’s sake, I had set up the dynamite detonating device in two stages.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The panel I had now at my fingertips could do nothing on its own.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Contact with the switchboard relay would awaken the slumbering fuse and ready it for reception.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My Uzi had been taken from me, but now—if only she managed her task successfully—I would gain a weapon many times more powerful.The girl went casually up the stairs.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Anticipation and nervous tension seemed to make the pain in my leg recede somewhat.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When she was halfway up the stairs, the shill shot her an inquiring look, which she answered with a frantic signal.Naturally, it would be hard for him to understand what she was up to, but at this point the only secret she and I could possibly share would have to concern a way out of the current impasse.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He fell in with her.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If all went as planned, I had no intention of leaving him in the cold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer followed her movements briefly, then showed no further interest.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Women are expected to have their own reasons for coming and going, beyond men’s understanding; in fact, men have a duty to pretend not to see.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She disappeared safely onto the bridge.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I thought of tiny air creatures faced with death.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Of schools of whales seeking survival that end up committing mass suicide instead.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My vision of eupcaccia tranquillity—had it been only an illusion?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Then why was there a merry-go-round in every amusement park worthy of the name?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If it could be proved that children on holiday were all schizo, very well; then I would resign myself, and withdraw.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.A destructive pressure now bore on my calf.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Had I not been wrapped in the protective bandage of the pipe, the flesh might well have ruptured.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It felt like the time my gums were inflamed with toothache.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I only wished I could lance it, and clean out the abscess within.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Had a surgeon chosen that moment to menace me with his scalpel, I doubted my ability to fend him off.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A butcher’s cleaver I would resist to the death; a surgeon’s scalpel could be the tool of my salvation.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But this weakening was a sign of danger.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The failure of the drugs to arrive probably meant the scout was haggling with a doctor reluctant to prescribe morphine; then again, it could have been that the doctor was taking a long time to dress, or even that the car engine wouldn’t start.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Would the doctor go along readily with an amputation?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He could always justify it on grounds that it would relieve suffering.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If he succeeded in stopping the bleeding, and if vascular suturing went well, and if effective measures to prevent suppuration could be taken, then medical ethics wouldn’t seem to argue against it.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even if the doctor should witness my amputated leg vanishing down the hole with a pop like that from a popgun, followed by the dismembered parts of a corpse, one after another, his ethical propriety would remain unimpeachable.The girl signaled to me from the parapet.At last the time had come, just as I had known that one day it would; I had always known, too, that it was something I would have to decide myself, without orders from anyone else.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I had put off that decision until now for the same reason that I had refrained from betting with the insect dealer as to whether or not the nuclear war would begin in five minutes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But in a nuclear war there could be no advance warning, which would give the enemy an irreversible advantage.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The button could be pushed for only two conceivable reasons: either a sudden, unforeseen accident, or the development of technology which conferred automatic first-strike victory on the user, thus ending the balance of power.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That moment could come at any time, without forewarning.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"By its very nature, nuclear war would begin all of a sudden, and as suddenly be over.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The variables are far greater than for an earthquake, making prediction far more problematical.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Warnings were unthinkable.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Any attack that left room for the operation of a warning system would be subject to the restraining forces of both sides.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The launching of the ark would inevitably take place one peaceful day, catching everyone unawares.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was not the slightest reason why that day should not be today.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All decisions are arbitrary in the end.Sengoku came back inside, having relieved himself.I brought out the remote-control panel from my belt, slid off the safety device, and held my finger quietly on the red button.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My conviction was low, but my expectations were high.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There would be vast alterations in the flow of the underground vein of water.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I might even be able to free myself from the toilet.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It would be a lonely, quiet launching, with not a single toast in celebration.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"This, I thought, was the only way to enter upon nuclear war— before it began.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Of those who were aware of the actual outbreak of war, the vast majority would be wiped out; only those whose ears were covered, who remained ignorant, would be able to survive.24ESCAPEA flash.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Innumerable whips lashed my skin where it was exposed.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then the hatch exploded, eradicating the oceanside entrance.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was no boom such as I had expected to hear, but my eardrums felt an excruciating pain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The light gave way instantly to black darkness.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Power failure.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The insect dealer switched on his cigarette lighter, its tiny flame emphasizing the vast darkness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
His shadow swayed against the wall; the rest of us were totally invisible.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Red Jacket’s groaning stopped.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even if he was still groaning, with the ringing in my ears I could never have heard him.Next there was a distant echo like a crack of thunder, and the whoosh of wind currents crossing and crisscrossing the ark.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It had worked.A warning buzzer went on and off, feeble in my ears after the roar of the blast.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As the one who had installed it, I felt a responsibility to make a statement:“Looks like a nuclear explosion.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That signal is the emergency warning.”No one answered right away.“It’s an earthquake, isn’t it?” said the girl in a scared voice.“It’s got to be.”“For an earthquake, I don’t notice many tremors,” said someone—perhaps Sengoku.“I hate to say it,” I repeated, “but I do think it’s a nuclear explosion.” I wished I could have the insect dealer do the talking for me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The system is designed to seal us off automatically in case of a nuclear explosion, by dynamiting all tunnels to the outside.”“I don’t know what kind of sensors you may be using, but how can you be so certain?” The insect dealer’s light came closer, leaving a wavering tail of flame in the air.“I’m not; I’m just stating the most obvious possibility.” Darkness in a room or a cave is of varying dimensions.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The darkness of, say, a clothes closet can actually be soothing, not frightening in the least.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"But the vaster the scale, the more menacing darkness becomes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The custom of burying the dead in coffins might have arisen from the desire to protect them from the uncertainty of large darkness by surrounding them with small darkness.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Here there were only seven of us, but it sounded like hundreds of fish gasping in a water tank lacking sufficient oxygen.“I want to know what makes you think so,” said the insect dealer, thrusting the flame of his light toward me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“It could have been set off by a sudden squall, couldn’t it?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There’s a front going by.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Maybe your sensor is just too sensitive.”“It’s far more sophisticated than that,” I said, feeling less and less confident in my ability to outtalk this man whose tongue was his fortune.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It’s computer-controlled.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There are pressure anemometers at the northern and southern extremities of the mountain, and when the difference in their measurements is greater than one-third, the computer registers it as a local, small-scale disturbance without proceeding to the next stage.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Other factors taken into consideration are duration of pressure, presence or absence of a heat wave, rate of temperature climb, and, of course, tests for radioactivity.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There’s no way it could be set off by a mere squall.”Light fell on the tunnel entrance.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was from a large portable lantern hanging from the adjutant’s shoulders, carefully positioned in such a way that his body was visible from the waist down only.“Excuse me, sir.” His tone hadn’t changed a whit.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Nerves of such steely resiliency demanded respect.“An emergency situation has arisen,” responded the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Possibly a nuclear explosion.” He seemed inclined to affirm that possibility rather than deny it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Flakes of light appeared in the flame of his lighter—a sign he was running out of fuel.“Nuclear weapons are essentially designed to be used in a preemptive strike.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It’s common knowledge among military analysts that in all-out nuclear warfare there would be no declaration of war.”“I’ll go get a lantern,” said the shill, and groped his way upstairs.“What’s that smell—radioactivity?” It was the young scout.“No, ding-dong—gunpowder,” said the adjutant flatly.“Powder smoke, it’s called.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"To a real man it smells sweet as roses.”“We’ll be safe from radiation in here,” said Sengoku, reassuring himself.“Is there a radio?” asked the adjutant, and clapped his ear with the palm of his hand.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He had apparently received a considerable physical shock.“There won’t be any broadcasting stations left,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“A one-megaton blast wipes out everything in a three-mile radius.Within a six-mile radius, high winds full of glass fragments whip around.”“Yes—so if there was reception, that would be a good sign.” I had to be cautious.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
This man was not only deranged but fast-thinking.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“The walls are so thick I don’t think radio waves would have a chance of getting in.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even if we had a radio.”“You know, Captain,” said the insect dealer, “you should have put everything you had on that bet.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You were too fainthearted.” He explained to the adjutant, “The captain and I had a bet going, you see, as to whether or not the bomb would fall in the next twenty-four hours.”“It was the next five minutes,” I corrected.“What’s the difference?” said the insect dealer.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Money’s worthless now, anyway.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You couldn’t lay wagers even if you wanted to.”“I know something just as good as money, or better,” persisted the adjutant.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“How about those junior high school girls?They’d make perfect stakes.”Lamplight flashed from the parapet on the bridge, crossing the ceiling in a straight line until it rested on the ruined hatch.The destruction was more complete than I had imagined.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The center of the steel door was smashed, and stone rubble had poured through; the shape was that of an expensive Japanese-style confection.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The dogs had doubtless been scared out of their wits.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The light moved on, fastening on the blue-sheeted corpse, which was covered with several fist-sized chunks of stone.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If he hadn’t been a corpse already, he would have been screaming in pain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Maybe he would even have died from the injuries.Suddenly Sengoku slammed a fist into his palm and hollered, “Then we did it, man!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We survived!” The light vanished, and the shill came down the stairs.“You mean we’re not dead.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"That’s all,” retorted the girl glumly.“We’re alive!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We survived!” Sengoku repeated, in tears, and sniffed.“Now comes the tough part: going on surviving,” said the adjutant, stroking Sengoku with his light.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Commander, what are your instructions?”“I don’t care—we survived,” said Sengoku again, kicking the floor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Everybody else has croaked.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Right, Mole?”“Lower your voice, will you?” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You’re giving me a headache.”There was a percussive sound, clear and carrying, but not sharp; rather like a distant drumbeat.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If this was the sound of falling water, then just as I’d hoped, there might have been an alteration in the flow of water underground.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I detected a change in the wriggling of the worms in my calf.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was I imagining it?Surely it was too soon for the effects to reveal themselves.Beaming his lantern ahead of him, the adjutant approached Red Jacket—who, had he stayed where he first was, would almost surely have been severely injured in a fusillade of stones.“Excuse me, sir!” screamed the young scout.“Is he dead?” asked the adjutant.“No, sir.”“Did he confess?”“No, sir.”“Scout A, have you forgotten your orders?”Just as the adjutant raised his steel-centered broom, the insect dealer issued a brisk, professional command.“Emergency directive.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Divide the Broom Brigade into squads, and assign each squad a turn at the air-purifying equipment.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A schedule of shifts will be issued later.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All men will be expected to participate in the work of charging batteries with the pedal-operated generators.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Choose all those men with mechanical experience, and start work on building a new generator, top speed.Register all men according to their skills, make up a list of names arranged by specialty, and appoint one man in charge of each division.”There was no mistake; it was definitely the sound of water drops hitting the storage drum.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Three in a row, a pause, then two.A clear sign that the flow of water had altered.“Repeat those orders,” said the adjutant to the young scout, jabbing him with the broom handle.“I can’t,” the youth replied, his voice shaking.“You have to be able to repeat an order,” said the adjutant.He might equally have been reproving the youth or the insect dealer.The flame of the cigarette lighter went out.“Adjutant, let’s be off,” said the insect dealer, leading the way toward the work hold.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Bring along the captive and set him to work.” He seemed desperate not to lose command.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In the light from the shill’s lamp, held up to see him off, we could see that he was gripping the small of the Uzi’s butt.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As if suddenly remembering, he swung around and said, “Captain, how about the filters on the air purification system?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All in place?” Knowing this to be sheer claptrap, I responded in kind.“Absolutely.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"BG-system triple-layer cooling filters.”“Everyone who can spare the time, report to the work hold,” he declared.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The adjutant followed, driving the youths before him.After him went Sengoku, muttering to himself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“We survived .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.we survived.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.”“ ‘Spare the time’?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Who could have more time to spare than us?” said the shill in disbelief.“Careful,” warned the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Don’t let them out of your sight, or who knows what they might do.” She pushed the reluctant shill along, lighting the way for him with the lantern.The beam traveled on, crawling along the wall and up to the ceiling, where it captured some sort of movement, like the swarming of bees.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Of course it was no such thing: it was a curtain of water spilling out over quite a wide area.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The noise of droplets hitting the drums came from a very small portion of the water on the ceiling.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With change proceeding at this pace, I became hopeful that the inner workings of the toilet might soon be affected too.“Water’s leaking,” said the girl, exploring the whole area with her lantern.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Is it always like this?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Look, there’s enough behind those drums to raise goldfish in.”The flood was building up swiftly.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was just after that that some sort of shock took place in the depths of the toilet.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My ears couldn’t hear it, but my leg did: it was like the sound of elevator doors echoing down in the base of a high-rise building.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Had the control valve turned around at last?“Would you mind gathering things up before they start to get wet?” I said.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The maps and tickets and eupcaccia box, for starters.”“You think the water will come this far?” she asked.“Probably.”“Are these chocolates?”“Liqueur-filled.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I eat them with my beer.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’ll bet you think that’s weird, but it tastes surprisingly good.”“What shall we do?” the girl said anxiously, choosing a chocolate.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Now that this has happened, won’t the toilet be more important than your leg, after all?”She stepped up on the edge of the toilet with one leg and put the eupcaccia box on the upper shelf.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The hem of her skirt was at my eye level, her bare kneecaps just in front of my lips.“There’s nothing to worry about,” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Cautiously, as when mixing gunpowder, I held my breath, and then said in a rush—as if unwrapping a gift that had cost an entire year’s salary—“It’s all a lie.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Now listen to me calmly, without getting excited.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was no nuclear explosion.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I lied.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Nothing of the kind happened.”The girl did not say anything right away.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The liqueur-filled chocolate in her fingers was crushed without a sound.“A lie?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You mean what you said was a lie, or the explosion was a lie?”“It was all a lie.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That was only some dynamite before.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You helped me, remember?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
By pushing that lever on the switchboard.”“But why .,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
?”“Two reasons.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"First, I was scared.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The nuclear war hadn’t even started yet, and look what was happening already.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I couldn’t bear it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The other reason is selfish: I did it because of the toilet—because of my leg.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I figured there was only a fifty-fifty chance it would work—or less; maybe one in three.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Remember, you and I talked about it before—the valve below.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was my last hope.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I wanted to change the flow of the water underground, and see if that wouldn’t change things.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
”“Did it?”“Yes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Look how the water is dripping from the ceiling.”“What about your leg?”“Just as I’d hoped.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It feels completely different.”“Better?”“Well, I wouldn’t say that.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"When your leg goes to sleep it feels worse when the circulation starts coming back, after all.Right now it hurts even to cough.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But that sensation of being slowly sucked down is definitely gone.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If someone gave me a hand, I bet I could manage to get out of here somehow.”“You’d better not tell anyone.”“I know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If they found out I’d wrecked the toilet, they’d murder me.”“Why did you tell me?”“You’re going to run away with me, aren’t you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
To where we can see the sky.”“How?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The passageways are all blocked off.”“There’s a way out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
A secret passageway.”“Where?”“Don’t tell anyone.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Nowadays all you hear is the public’s right to know, but it seems to me that lying is often more practical.It’s upstairs, locker number one.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"“Maybe his blood started flowing backward, and it’s affected his mind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Do you suppose that could happen?”“Why not tell him the truth?” I said.“The truth?” he said.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“What are you talking about?” She ignored me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“How are things going over there?” she asked.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Do you think you can hit it off with Komono and the adjutant?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Do you think you can make a go of it here?”“Good question.” He rubbed his face with his palms and said, “Oh, I’ll probably manage one way or another.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

Not like the sweet-potato man; he strikes me as a manic-depressive type.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"Slowly I completed a quarter-turn, without the least sensation of being pulled down inside.“Attaboy!",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

The shill had rights too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If I left him behind without telling him either that the toilet was now unusable (without, I guessed, extensive redesigning and reconstruction) or that I planned to escape through a secret passage, doubtless afterwards I would hate myself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Barring special circumstances—though, indeed, I could scarcely imagine what they might be—he deserved to come with us.“Doesn’t it hurt?” asked the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
(Why didn’t she tell the shill the truth?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
")“A little pain makes it easier to bear—cancels out the pins and needles.”“You’re coming up—a good inch!” she said encouragingly.“Keep it up!”“Funny,” said the shill in the same muffled voice as before, penlight still in his mouth.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Who would have thought I’d outlive the whole rest of the world?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Me!,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I can’t believe it.”“What if it’s not true?” I couldn’t keep still.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Would the girl feel disappointed?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
She didn’t look that way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She just looked from me to the shill and back and tilted her head to one side, her mouth drawn out in a line.“Eh?”“All that happened was that I set off some dynamite, to see if I could release the pressure inside the toilet.”“You sure do things in a big way.” He didn’t seem especially outraged.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“So you mean the bit about the nuclear blast wasn’t true?”“That’s right.”“Well, that’s the way it goes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Shall we try turning the other way now?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I bet you’re feeling a lot lighter.”“He’s come up almost an inch and a half,” she said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Just a little bit more now.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Once the calf is out, you’re home free.”“Aagh.” I grimaced with pain.“Shall I slow down?”“No, I’m okay.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It just gave my knee a twinge there for a minute.”“Well, well.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"So it was all a lie—the world is going on the same as ever, this very moment?”“We aren’t trapped in here, either; there’s a secret way out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I didn’t tell anyone.”“In other words, not one thing has changed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Go ahead, lean your full weight on me.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It’s okay.”He was acting too blasé.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Had his extraordinary suspiciousness sealed off all his emotions?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That couldn’t be.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
He had been overreacting to every little stimulus.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even the insect dealer had said to watch out for him, that people with heavy secretions of saliva were violent.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Could he possibly not be aware of the seriousness of the situation?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or was the situation possibly not as serious as I found it?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Perhaps his self-respect was involved: Someone who prides himself on his own sleight of hand can’t afford to fall all over himself with surprise every time someone else reveals the secret of a trick.From the work hold flashed the highly condensed beam of a flashlight; footsteps drew near.The girl whispered, “Should we turn off our lights?”“That would only seem more suspicious.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Just act natural.” A figure stood in the tunnel entrance.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"By now the floodwater was ankle-deep, so whoever it was made no attempt to come further.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The beam swept around the floor in a circular motion, like a lighthouse light.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Of the storage drums, the five in the back containing kerosene, the three filled with alcohol, and the two filled with drinking water (I changed it once a week) stayed put, but the dozen or so empty ones had already floated out of line and were starting to drift over to the seaward wall.Probably the floor tilted in that direction.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The vinyl-sheeted bundle lay in the same place as before, soaked in water.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"He must be sorry he’s dead now, hating baths as much as he did in his lifetime, I thought.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Despite the flash of understanding, I couldn’t help him, and wouldn’t have, anyway; but slowly I was beginning to see that he had been a man of irremediable loneliness.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The light swung around and found us.“Terrible flood in here.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What are you doing?” It was the insect dealer.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But he pressed us no further.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Probably he found it too troublesome to take responsibility for me and my present difficulty.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“We called roll and found that fortunately seventy percent of the men were inside the blockade line.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We’re incredibly busy.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There aren’t many places left we haven’t looked, so we’ll have to change our search methods.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Right now the men are hunting in every cranny, using condenser mikes.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
We’re going to try some excavating too.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Captain, can you hang on a bit longer?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It won’t be much more.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Just say the word if you need anything to eat or drink.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The body will keep awhile longer.”“What do you suppose is happening outside?” said the shill innocently, asking the expected questions to avoid arousing suspicion.“By now it’s raining glass shards and radiation.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Well, Captain, don’t hesitate to let me know.” With this, he passed his light over the ceiling and withdrew.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill hadn’t betrayed me.Evidently the seriousness of the situation had not escaped him.“I think my calf just pulled free.”The girl shone her penlight down inside the toilet, and stuck a finger between my leg and the pipe.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I felt nothing.“You’re right—there’s about a finger’s width of space there now.”After that everything went unexpectedly easily.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With one arm around each of their shoulders, I hauled myself up in midair, as simultaneously water came welling up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Probably the pressurization from below aided in my release—but now this toilet was no longer a toilet.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had thought my leg would be all bloody, but it wasn’t as bad as I feared: the shin and the top of my foot were skinned, and there was no other external injury.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The whole leg was swollen and purplish-red, however, as if smeared with ink from a souvenir stamp pad at a Shinto shrine.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Looking carefully, I saw that the old scar where I’d been chained long ago was sprinkled with tiny bloodstains, like grains of rough-ground pepper.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It would be some time before I could wear a shoe again.The joint seemed unaffected, so I anticipated no difficulty walking, as soon as sensation returned.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
It was the rest of me that was totally worn out.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I decided to sit down on the encyclopedia and continue hiding my leg in the toilet, until sensation returned to the sole of my foot and the crick in my ankle went away.“Thanks a million.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I’d about given up hope.”“So nothing’s changed,” mused the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“I’m no different from before.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We didn’t really ‘survive,’ after all.” Clawing the sides of the toilet, I sought to endure the agony of returning sensation; it felt as if the raw nerves were at the mercy of a merciless wind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I forced myself to exercise the ankle.“You’re strange, you know that?” I scoffed.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“You actually sound regretful.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"None of that crowd is worth a moment’s regret, if you ask me.”“They are a bedraggled lot, those old men,” he agreed.“Scraggly eyebrows, long hairs sticking out of their noses, wrinkled hippopotamuses under their chins .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Well, you can’t blame them for how they look, can you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"What I can’t forgive is that miserable, know-it-all thickheadedness of theirs.”“As soon as you’re ready, let’s go.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The longer we hang around here, the greater the chance they’ll be back.”“He’s right,” said the girl, and added, laughing, “After all, you’re bound to have a lot to do after your new promotion.” She bent over in leapfrog position.Laying a hand on her shoulder, I stood on my right leg and set my freed left leg on the floor.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was no pain, and the knee and hip joints did everything I told them to.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The leg might look like a rotten eggplant, but inside, anyway, it was sound.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Cheered, I shifted my weight.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My vision whirled, and before I could tell what was happening, pain was shooting through my shoulder and arm, and I lay face down in water, Evidently sensation had not yet returned to the left leg.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill and the girl helped me up.“I’ll carry you piggyback,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Come on—this is no time to stand on ceremony.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"With you out of the toilet, every second counts.”He was right.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If they knew I’d gotten free, our chances for escaping here would dwindle.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I put my arms around his neck, keeping my right foot on the ground to ease his burden.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Reeling, he spluttered:“How much do you weigh?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’re just as heavy as you look, aren’t you?”The girl’s voice followed us.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You want your camera, don’t you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Shall I get it?”“Yes, the one that’s out, and the case next to it, if you don’t mind.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
They’re heavy.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"While you’re at it, I’d appreciate it if you could bring the eupcaccia.”There were dozens of others out in the jeep, I knew, but somehow they weren’t the same.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I could only be satisfied with my eupcaccia, the one that I had checked with my own eyes.“Something bothers me .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
".” said the shill, his breath coming hard.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“It’s all this water.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You don’t suppose the entire cave is going to be flooded, do you?”“My guess, from the general topography, is that it won’t go higher than a foot or so off the ground.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The work hold will be all right.”“What about places lower than this?”“Some will become pools, filled to the ceiling.”“What if those girls are really hiding out somewhere?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Then they could flee from the water right into a waiting net.” I hadn’t thought of it before, but there was such a possibility.Was that my responsibility too?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My brain could not forget the adjutant’s comment likening young girls to wet paper.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It seemed unlikely, but what if these people, thinking this was all that remained of the world, should go on living here in this spurious ark for a year, two years, three, four—maybe a decade or longer—spinning out their days.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.The girl caught up with us in front of the lockers.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“These are heavy.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I see photography isn’t all just pushing buttons—it’s hard work!”“You’d better believe it,” said the shill.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“Even flea circus trainers end up with a sprained back, you know.” He used the back of his hand to wipe sweat from his chin, then rubbed the hand on the side of his trousers.I glanced with satisfaction at the label on locker number one: “Flammable Solvents; Lathe Blades, All Sizes; Rubber Work Aprons; Infrared Lamps; Waterproof Sandpaper; Insulation; Corking Materials; Aluminum; Heat-resistant Facial Cream.” A plausible list of items that nobody would be likely to need or care about, and yet that aroused no suspicions.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Even the most rapacious thief would surely decide it was not worth the trouble of breaking the lock.Right 1—left 1—right 1.The items actually stored inside were a close match for the label on the door, although in some cases the containers were barely filled, or empty.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The idea was to lower the overall weight, but even so, I was careful not to make it suspiciously light.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Rails were attached to the locker ceiling, and when a hook was removed, the shelves swung out opposite the door.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"In other words, they served as a hidden inner door.From beyond the back of the locker, now opened, there swept up a moist breeze smelling rather like the warehouse in the fish market.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill’s penlight lit up the casing of the escape hatch, which measured two feet by two and a half.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill whistled.“You could fool anybody with this.”“Maybe I had a presentiment something like this would happen.”“Where does it lead?” he asked.“He says it comes out underneath the city hall,” answered the girl in my place.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There was a lilt in her voice, as if she sensed light at the end of a very long tunnel.“Is it safe?”“Of course.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The nuclear explosion’s a fake, and I deliberately left the dynamite unconnected here.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Let’s go—there’s no time to waste.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Once they’re on to us, that will be that.”“What will they do when they find out?” asked the girl, hunching her shoulders and stifling a giggle.“I wouldn’t worry.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"They’ll be too busy looking for those junior high school girls for the time being.” The shill passed a critical hand over the locker door.“I’m a girl too, you know,” she said.“They wouldn’t dare lay a hand on a crack shot like you,” he answered.“What do you mean?” I said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“You’re both coming with me, aren’t you?”“I can’t decide .",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.” he said.“What is there to decide?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’ve had it with those old men, haven’t you?”“Still, I don’t know.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.” He stepped out of the locker and bit his lower lip.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A sound like uneven hand-clapping, apparently an echo from the work hold, rose and fell like the sound of rain pelting eaves.“The world outside is exactly the same as before.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
All that about a nuclear war was a pack of lies.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Don’t tell me you’re going to stay here knowing it was a lie.”“That depends.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"If you imagine it really happened, then it seems real.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"And you’ve been saying so all along, haven’t you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That one of these days it really would happen.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
That a nuclear war starts before it starts.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.” All three of us pricked up our ears in the darkness.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It was either an unintelligible command from the insect dealer, or a howl of laughter from Sengoku, or a scream.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The shill went on: “I wouldn’t mind a bit—staying on here as we are awhile longer.”“You’re out of your mind.” I fixed my eyes on the girl, seeking her support.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“I don’t care how good a shot you are—you can’t stay awake twenty-four hours a day.”“That’s true—the air here is too stale,” said the girl, her voice muffled and hesitant.“It’s not only the air.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"There’s no sky, no day and night.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You can’t even take pictures.”“If you’re going, you’d better get on with it,” he said.The girl drew her lips into a sharp line, tilted her head, and looked from me to the shill and back.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
What a peculiar fellow—why in the world was he hesitating?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I couldn’t understand it.“Let’s go; there’s no more time for jokes,” I said.“No—I really think I’ll hold off.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Wherever and however I decide to go on living, it doesn’t make a hell of a lot of difference.Besides, professionally speaking, that’s what I’m for—responding to lies as if they were true, knowing full well they’re not.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

“I’ll talk to him for you.”“I wouldn’t if I were you.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
You’re only going to make things worse.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Thanks, but no thanks.”“You’re right,” murmured the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

They’re us.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We’re sakura, don’t forget.”If that was the way they were going to be, let them.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I had simply felt a duty to tell them of this chance to escape, in return for their help in getting me free.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Still, it seemed unreasonable of him to keep the girl there too.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All along I had dreamed of escaping with her, just the two of us; and if only the shill hadn’t interfered, she would have come.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I was the one who had told the shill about this escape route; she had never opened her mouth.“Why don’t you at least let her go free?”“She is free.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Stop talking that way.” He turned to her.“Right?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"You’re free, aren’t you?” He prodded her along, and she nodded hesitantly.“Never mind that,” he said.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
“Do you know how the word sakura—cherry blossoms—came to be used for people like us?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"It comes from the expression ‘Blossom-viewing is free.’ In other words, it costs us nothing to do our shopping.” I noticed he had stopped calling me Captain.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
So be it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I handed him the control panel, said what I had to say, and thus carried out what I took to be my duty.“The key to the jeep is in it, right?”The shill nodded as he accepted the control panel.“That’s right.”“They’ll have it in for you for letting me go.”“Them?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Have it in for me?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
No.”“How are you going to explain?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I don’t know about Komono, but that adjutant means business.”“I’ll tell them you got all soft and squishy, and the toilet just swallowed you right up.”“Who’s going to believe that?”“They will.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"All right, go, will you?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I’ll look after the ship.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Not that I’m all that sure of myself.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

"But now that the anchor’s up, it would be a shame to sink her so fast.”“Sorry about that encyclopedia,” said the girl.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"“The last three volumes are soaking wet.”She set my camera case down on the floor of the locker, sliding it back in with the toe of her shoe.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Meaning to follow her, I tripped over her leg and fell forward, taking advantage of the situation to push her deeper inside the locker, covering her with my body.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I couldn’t let this sudden intimacy daunt me; we had a long trip ahead of us, traveling together down this tunnel.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"We would warm each other as we waited for dawn, protecting each other from cold and darkness.But my shoulders were hindered by the locker, and my torso hung tilted in the air.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"My shoulders measured seventeen inches across, and the locker a mere thirteen; there was no way I could get through facing straight ahead.“Are you all right?” With a wry smile, the shill grasped my left shoulder and pulled, while pushing on my right shoulder, turning me ninety degrees.My leg was still not what it should be.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I felt myself go on crashing to the right, unable to retrieve my balance.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
The girl slipped out from beneath me.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For some reason, the shill’s penlight went out.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"As I fell, I grabbed hold of the hem of her skirt.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
There was the sound of my shirt ripping in back; a couple of buttons popped off.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Partly it was the fault of the inner construction of the locker, but mostly it had to do with the accumulation of fat on my stomach.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
My ribs banged against the camera case with a noise like someone pounding rice cakes.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Pain flashed not so much there as in my knee and neck.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Somebody was grasping my ankle and pushing it.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I could feel myself slide with the camera case across the stone floor.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Something fell on my back—a shoe.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Where was the girl?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I could feel her skirt in my hand, yet strangely I could not tell where she was.“Take care.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura

.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"or so I expected, but to my chagrin, all that remained in my hand was the skirt itself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Had it come off ?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I could hardly bear to give her up.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"A moment later, I realized that what I had taken for her skirt was in fact a rubber work apron.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
When had that misapprehension occurred?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"She was free, I told myself.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Of her own free will she had shut herself up in there.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Or was I the one who had been shut up in here?,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"For a while I lay where I was and rested, clinging to the case.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Somewhere only a few feet away she was staring wide-eyed into the dark with those eyes that forced you to trust her, like it or not.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
But there was no meaning anymore in the units of distance between us.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I got up, and immediately fell over again.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I took off my shoes and tied them together, slung them around my neck, and started crawling down the tunnel on both hands and one knee, dragging my camera case behind me.25THE TRANSPARENT TOWNIt took a long time.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I seem to have slept more than once along the way.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The numbness in my leg subsided, and sensation returned to my knees; but by the time I reached the basement of the city hall, the sun was coming up.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"After waiting for people to start coming and going, I went outside.Transparent rays of sun, the first I had seen in a long time, stained the streets and buildings red.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The area was lively with the mingled flow of bicycles moving south along the riverside fish market, and commuters hurrying north to the station on foot.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"On a truck marked LIVE FISH, a small flag fluttered in the breeze, inscribed with the words FISH BEFORE PEOPLE.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Another truck, waiting at a stoplight, proclaimed, WHEN I AM GONE AND THECHERRIES BLOOM, LOVE WILL ALSO BLOOM.Facing the black-glass walls of the city hall, I set up my camera, using the wide-angle lens, and focused.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I meant to take a souvenir photograph of myself and the street, but everything was too transparent.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Not only the light but the people as well: you could see right through them.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
Beyond the transparent people lay a transparent town.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"Was I transparent, then, too?",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I held a hand up to my face—and through it saw buildings.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"I turned around, and looked all about me; still everything was transparent.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
"The whole town was dead, in an energetic, lifelike way.",Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
I decided not to think anymore about who could or would survive.,Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura
ONE day in August a man disappeared.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had simply set out for the seashore on a holiday, scarcely half a day away by train, and nothing more was ever heard of him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Investigation by the police and inquiries in the newspapers had both proved fruitless.Of course, missing persons are not really uncommon.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"According to the statistics, several hundred disappearances are reported every year.Moreover, the proportion of those found again is unexpectedly small.Murders or accidents always leave some clear piece of evidence, and the motives for kidnapping are normally ascertainable.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But if the instance does not come under some such heading, clues—and this is especially true in the case of missing persons—are extremely difficult to come by.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Many disappearances, for example, may be described as simple escape.In the case of this man, also, the clues were negligible.Though his general destination was known, there had been no report from the area that a body had been discovered.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"By its very nature, it was inconceivable that his work involved some secret for which he might have been abducted.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His quite normal behavior had not given the slightest hint that he intended to vanish.Naturally, everyone at first imagined that a woman was involved.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But his wife, or at least the woman he lived with, announced that the objectof his trip had been to collect insect specimens.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The police investigators and his colleagues felt vaguely disappointed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The insect bottle and net were hardly a feint for a runaway trip with a girl.Then, too, a station employee at S———had remembered a man getting offthe train who looked like a mountainclimber and carried slung across hisshoulders a canteen and a woodenbox, which he took to be a painting setThe man had been alone, quite alone,the employee said, so speculationabout a girl was groundless.The theory had been advanced thatthe man, tired of life, had committedsuicide.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"One of his colleagues, whowas an amateur psychoanalyst, held tothis view.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He claimed that in a grownman enthusiasm for such a uselesspastime as collecting insects wasevidence enough of a mental quirk.Even in children, unusualpreoccupation with insect collecting frequently indicates an Oedipus complex.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In order to compensate for his unsatisfied desires, the child enjoys sticking pins into insects, which he need never fear will escape.And the fact that he does not leave off once he has grown up is quite definitely a sign that the condition has become worse.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Thus it is far from accidental that entomologists frequently have an acute desire for acquisitions and that they are extremely reclusive, kleptomaniac, homosexual.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
From this point to suicide out of weariness with the world is but a step.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As a matter of fact, there are even some collectors who are attracted by the potassium cyanide in their bottles rather than by the collecting itself, and no matter how they try they are quite incapable of washing their hands of the business.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Indeed, the man had not once confided his interests to anyone, and this would seem to be proof that he realized they were rather dubious.Yet, since no body had actually been discovered, all of these ingenious speculations were groundless.Seven years had passed without anyone learning the truth, and so, in compliance with Section 30 of the civil code, the man had been pronounced dead.2ONE August afternoon a man stood in the railroad station at S———.He wore a gray peaked hat, and the cuffs of his trousers were tucked into his stockings.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A canteen and a large wooden box were slung over his shoulders.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He seemed about to set out on a mountain-climbing expedition.Yet there were no mountains worth climbing in the immediate vicinity.Indeed, the guard who took his ticket at the gate looked at him quizzically after he passed through.The man showed no hesitancy as he entered the bus standing in front of the station and took a seat in the back.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The bus route led away from the mountains.The man stayed on the bus to the end of the run.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he got off, the landscape was a mixture of hillocks and hollows.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The lowlands were rice paddies that had been divided into narrow strips, while among them slightly elevated fields planted with persimmon trees were scattered about like islands.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The man passed through a village and continued walking in the direction of the seashore; the soil gradually became whitish and dry.After a time there were no more houses, only straggling clumps of pine.Then the soil changed to a fine sand that clung to his feet.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Now and again clumps of dry grass cast shadows in hollows in the sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As if by mistake, there was occasionally a meager plot of eggplants, the size of a straw mat.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But of human shadows there was not a trace.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The sea, toward which he was headed, lay beyond.For the first time the man stopped.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He wiped the perspiration from his face with his sleeve and gazed around.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"With deliberation, he opened the wooden box and from the top drawer took out several pieces of pole that had been bundled together.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He assembled them into a handle and attached an insect net to one end.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Then he began to walk again, striking the clumps of grass with the bottom of the shaft.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The smell of the sea enveloped the sands.Some time went by, but the sea still could not be seen.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps the hilly terrain obstructed the view.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The unchanging landscape stretched endlessly on.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Then, suddenly, the perspective broadened and a hamlet came into sight.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was a commonplace, rather poor village, whose roofs, weighted down with stones, lay clustered around a high fire tower.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Some of the roofs were shingled with black tile; others were of zinc, painted red.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A zinc-roofed building at the hamlet's single crossroad seemed to be the meeting house of a fishermen's cooperative.Beyond, there were probably more dunes, and the sea.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Still, the hamlet was spread out to an unexpected extent.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There were some fertile patches, but the soil consisted mostly of dry white sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There were fields of potatoes and peanuts, and the odor of domestic animals mingled with that of the sea.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A pile of broken shells formed a white mound at the side of the clay-and-sand road, which was as hard as cement.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As the man passed down the street, children were playing in the empty lot in front of the cooperative, some old men were sitting on the sagging veranda repairing their nets, and thin-haired women were gathered in front of the single general store.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
All movement ceased for a moment as they looked curiously at him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But the man paid no attention.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Sand and insects were all that concerned him.However, the size of the village was not the only surprising thing.Contrary to what one would expect, the road was gradually rising.Since it led toward the sea, it would be more natural for it to descend.Could he have misread the map?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He tried questioning a young village girl who was passing by just then.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But she lowered her eyes and, acting as if she had not heard a thing, hurried on.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yet the pile of shells, the fishing nets, and the color of the sand told him that certainly the sea lay nearby.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was really nothing yet that foretold danger.The road began to rise more and more abruptly; more and more it became just sand.But, curiously enough, the areas where houses stood were not the slightest bit higher.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The road alone rose, while the hamlet itself continued to remain level.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No, it was not only the road; the areas between the buildings were rising at the same rate.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In a sense, then, the whole village seemed to have become a rising slope with only the buildings left on their original level.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
This impression became more striking as he went along.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At length, all the houses seemed to be sunk into hollows scooped in the sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The surface of the sand stood higher than the rooftops.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The successive rows of houses sank deeper and deeper into the depressions.The slope suddenly steepened.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It must have been at least sixty-five feet down to the tops of the houses.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What in heaven's name could it be like to live there?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"he thought in amazement, peering down into one of the holes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
As he circled around the edge he was suddenly struck by a biting wind that choked his breath in his throat.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The view abruptly opened up, and the turbid, foaming sea licked at the shore below.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was standing on the crest of the dunes that had been his objective!The side of the dunes that faced the sea and received the monsoon winds rose abruptly, but straggling clumps of scrub grass grew in places where the incline was not as steep.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The man looked back over his shoulder at the village, and he could see that the great holes, which grew deeper as they approached the crest of the ridge, extended in several ranks toward the center.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The village, resembling the cross-section of a beehive, lay sprawled over the dunes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Or rather the dunes lay sprawled over the village.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Either way, it was a disturbing and unsettling landscape.But it was enough that he had reached his destination, the dunes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The man drank some water from his canteen and filled his lungs with air—and the air which had seemed so clear felt rough in his throat.The man intended to collect insects that lived in the dunes.Of course, dune insects are small and soberly colored.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But he was a dedicated collector, and his eye was not tempted by anything like butterflies or dragonflies.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Such collectors do not aspire to decking out their specimen boxes with gaudy samples, nor are they particularly interested in classification or in raw materials for Chinese medicines.The true entomologist's pleasure is much simpler, more direct: that of discovering a new type.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When this happens, the discovers name appears in the illustrated encyclopedias of entomology appended to the technical Latin name of the newly found insect; and there, perhaps, it is preserved for something less than eternity.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His efforts are crowned with success if his name is perpetuated in the memory of his fellow men by being associated with an insect.The smaller, unobtrusive insects, with their innumerable strains, offer many opportunities for new discoveries.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"For a long time the man had also been on the lookout for double winged flies, especially common house flies, which people find so repulsive.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, the various types of flies are unbelievably numerous, and since all entomologists seem to think pretty much alike, they have pursued their investigations into the eighth rare mutant found in Japan almost to completion.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps mutants are so abundant because the fly's environment is too close to man's.He had best begin by observing environment.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"That there were many environmental variations simply indicated a high degree of adaptability among flies, didn't it?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At this discovery he jumped with joy.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His concept might not be altogether bad.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The fact that the fly showed great adaptability meant that it could be at home even in unfavorable environments in which other insects could not live—for example, a desert where all other living things perished.From then on he began to manifest an interest in sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And soon this interest bore fruit.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
One day in the dry river bed near his house he discovered a smallish light-pink insect which resembled a double-winged garden beetle ( Cicindela japonica Motschulsky).,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It is common knowledge, of course, that the garden beetle presents many variations in color and design.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But the form of the front legs, on the other hand, varies very little.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In fact, the front legs of the sheath-wing beetle constitute an important criterion for its classification.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And the second joint on the front legs of the insect that had caught the man's eye did indeed have striking characteristics.Generally speaking, the front legs of the beetle family are black, slender, and agile.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"However, the front legs of this one seemed to be covered with a stout sheath; they were round, almost chubby, and cream-colored.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, they may have been smeared with pollen.One might even assume some sort of condition—the presence of hair, for example—which would cause the pollen to adhere to the legs.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
If his observations were correct he had certainly made a most important discovery.But unfortunately he had let it escape.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had been too excited, and besides the beetle's pattern of flight was confusing.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It flew away, and then as if to say ""Catch me!""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
it turned and waited.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he approached it cautiously it flew away again, turned around, and waited.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Mercilessly tantalizing, its course had at last led it to a clump of grass into which it disappeared.The man was completely captivated by the beetle with the yellowish front legs.When he had observed the sandy soil, it seemed to him that his guess was correct.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Actually, the beetle family is representative of desert insects.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"According to one theory, their strange pattern of flight is a snare for the purpose of enticing small animals away from their nests.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Prey such as mice and lizards are lured out in spite of themselves, wander into the desert, and collapse from hunger and fatigue.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Their bodies then become the beetles' food.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"These beetles have the elegant Japanese name of ""letter-bearer"" and present graceful features, but actually they have sharp jaws and are ferocious and cannibalistic by nature.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But whether or not his theory was correct, the man was unquestionably beguiled by the mysterious pattern of the beetle's flight.And his interest in sand, which was the condition for the beetle's existence, could not help but grow.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He began to read everything he could about it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And as his research progressed he realized that sand was a very interesting substance.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"For example, opening to the article on sand in the encyclopedia, he found the following: SAND: an aggregate of rock fragments.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Sometimes including loadstone, tinstone, and more rarely gold dust.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Diameter: 2 to 1/16 mm.A very clear definition indeed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In short, then, sand came from fragmented rock and was intermediate between clay and pebbles.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But simply calling it an intermediate substance did not provide a really satisfactory explanation.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Why was it that isolated deserts and sandy terrain came into existence through the sifting out of only the sand from soil in which clay, sand, and stones were thoroughly mixed together?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If a true intermediate substance were involved, the erosive action of wind and water would necessarily produce any number of intermingling intermediate forms in the range between rock and clay.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"However, there are in fact only three forms that can be clearly distinguished from one another: stones, sand, and clay.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Furthermore, sand is sand wherever it is; strangely enough, there is almost no difference in the size of the grains whether they come from the Gobi Desert or from the beach at Eno-shima.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The size of the grains shows very little variation and follows a Gaussian distribution curve with a true mean of 1/8 mm.One commentary gave a very simple explanation of the decomposition of land through the erosive action of wind and water: the lighter particles were progressively blown away over great distances.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But the particular significance of the 1/8-mm.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
diameter of the grains was left unexplained.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In opposition to this, another book on geology added an explanation along these lines:Air or water currents set up a turbulence.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The smallest wavelength of this turbulent flow is about equal to the diameter of the desert sand.Owing to this peculiarity, only the sand is extracted from the soil, being drawn out at right angles to the flow.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If the cohesion of the soil is weak, the sand is sucked up into the air by light winds—which, of course, do not disturb stones or clay—and falls to the ground again, being deposited to the leeward.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The peculiarities of sand would seem to be a matter of aerodynamics.Hence, we can add this to the first definition as ""b"": a particle of crushed rock of such dimension as to be easily moved by a fluid.Because winds and water currents flow over the land, the formation of sand is unavoidable.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As long as the winds blew, the rivers flowed, and the seas stirred, sand would be born grain by grain from the earth, and like a living being it would creep everywhere.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The sands never rested.Gently but surely they invaded and destroyed the surface of the earth.This image of the flowing sand made an indescribably exciting impact on the man.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The barrenness of sand, as it is usually pictured, was not caused by simple dryness, but apparently was due to the ceaseless movement that made it inhospitable to all living things.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What a difference compared with the dreary way human beings clung together year in year out.Certainly sand was not suitable for life.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yet, was a stationary condition absolutely indispensable for existence?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Didn't unpleasant competition arise precisely because one tried to cling to a fixed position?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If one were to give up a fixed position and abandon oneself to the movement of the sands, competition would soon stop.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Actually, in the deserts flowers bloomed and insects and other animals lived their lives.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"These creatures were able to escape competition through their great ability to adjust—for example, the man's beetle family.While he mused on the effect of the flowing sands, he was seized from time to time by hallucinations in which he himself began to move with the flow.3His head bent down, he began to walk, following the crescent-shaped line of dunes that surrounded the village like a rampart and towered above it.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He paid almost no attention to the distant landscape.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
An entomologist must concentrate his whole attention within a radius of about three yards around his feet.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And it is one of the fundamental rules that he should not have the sun at his back.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If the sun should get behind him, he would frighten the insects with his own shadow.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
As a result; a collector's forehead and nose are always sunburned.The man advanced slowly at a steady pace.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
With every step the sand splashed up over his shoes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Except for shallow-rooted weeds that looked as though they would shoot up in a day if there were any moisture, there appeared to be no living thing.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Once in a long while, tortoise-shell-colored flies would flit around, drawn by the odor of human perspiration.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"However, precisely because it was such a place, he could expect to find something.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Beetles are not especially gregarious, and they say that, in extreme cases, a single beetle will cordon off an area of as much as one square mile.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Patiently, he kept walking round and round.Suddenly he paused in his tracks.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Something had stirred near the roots of a clump of grass.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was a spider.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Spiders were of no use to him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He sat down to smoke a cigarette.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The wind blew ceaselessly from the sea and, far below, turbulent white waves beat against the base of the sand dunes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Where the dunes fell away to the west a slight hill crowned with bare rock jutted out into the sea.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
On it the sunshine lay scattered in needlepoints of light.He had difficulty getting his matches to light.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Out of ten tries not one had caught.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Along the length of the match-sticks he had thrown away, ripples of sand were moving at about the speed of the second hand of his watch.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He focused his attention on one wavelet, and when it arrived at the tip of his heel he arose.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The sand spilled from the gathers in his trousers.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He spat, and the inside of his mouth felt rough.So probably there weren't too many insects.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps the movement of the sand was too violent.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No, he shouldn't be so quickly discouraged; his theory guaranteed that there would be some.The line of dunes leveled off, and a section jutted out on the side away from the sea.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was lured on by the feeling that in all probability his prey was there, and he made his way down the gentle slope.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Here and there the remains of what seemed like a wind fence made of wattling marked off the point of the promontory, beyond which, on a still lower level, lay a plateau.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He went on, cutting across the ripples of sand, which were hewn with machine-like regularity.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Suddenly his line of vision was cut off, and he stood on the verge of a cliff looking down into a deep cavity.The cavity, over sixty feet wide, formed an irregular oval.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The far slope seemed relatively gentle, while in contrast the near side gave the feeling of being almost perpendicular.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It rolled up to his feet in a smooth curve, like a lip of heavy porcelain.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Placing one foot gingerly on the edge, he peered in.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The shadowy interior of the hole, set against the luminous edge, already announced the approach of evening.In the gloom at the bottom a small house lay submerged in silence.One end of its ridgepole was sunk diagonally into the sand wall.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Quite like an oyster, he thought.No matter what they did, he mused, there was no escaping the law of the sand.Just as he was placing his camera in position, the sand at his feet began to move with a rustle.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He drew his foot back, shuddering, but the flow of the sand did not stop for some time.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"What a delicate, dangerous balance!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Breathing deeply, he wiped his sweaty palms several times on the sides of his trousers.A coughing broke out next to him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Unnoticed, an old man, apparently one of the village fishermen, was standing there almost touching his shoulder.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As he looked at the camera and then at the bottom of the hole, the old fellow grinned, screwing up his face, which was wrinkled like a half-tanned rabbit skin.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A sticky secretion encrusted the corners of his reddened eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Are you inspecting?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""It was a thin voice, blown by the wind, rather as if it came from a portable radio.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But the accent was clear and not particularly difficult to catch.""Inspecting?""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Flustered, he concealed the lens with his palm.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He shifted his insect net into full view.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""What do you mean?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I don't understand.I'm collecting insects.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"My specialty is sand insects.""""What?""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The old man did not seem to have understood.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Collecting insects,"" he repeated again in a loud voice.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Insects.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Insects.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"I catch them like this!""""Insects?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The old man appeared dubious.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Looking down, he spat Or perhaps it would be more exact to say he let the spittle ooze from his mouth.Snatched from his lips by the wind, it sailed out in a long thread.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Good heavens, what was he so nervous about?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Is there some inspecting going on in this vicinity?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""No, no.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As long as you're not inspecting, I really don't mind what you do.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""No, I'm not inspecting.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The old man, without even nodding, turned his back and, scuffing the tips of his straw sandals, went slowly away along the ridge.Some fifty yards further on—when had they come?—three men dressed alike, apparently waiting for the old man, squatted silently on the sand.The one in the middle had a pair of binoculars, which he was turning around and around on his knee.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Soon the three, joined by the old man, began to discuss something among themselves.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They kicked the sand at their feet.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It looked as if they were having a violent argument.Just as he was trying unconcernedly to go on with his search for the beetle, the old man came hurrying back again.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Then you're really not someone from the government office?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""The government office?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You're quite wrong.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Abruptly he took out his business card, as if to indicate that he had had enough.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The old man's lips moved laboriously.""Ah!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You're a schoolteacher!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""I have absolutely no connection with the government office.""""Hmm.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
So you're a teacher.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""At last he appeared to understand, and the corners of his eyes wrinkled up.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Carrying the card respectfully, he went back again.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The three others, apparently satisfied, stood up and withdrew.But the old man returned once again.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""By the way, what do you intend doing now?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""Well, I'm going to look for insects.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""But the last bus back has already gone.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""Isn't there any place I can stay here?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""Stay all night?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In this village?""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The man's face twitched.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""If I can't stay here, I'll walk on to the next village.""""Walk?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""As a matter of fact, I'm in no special hurry.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""Well, why go to all that trouble?""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He suddenly became loquacious.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""You can see this is a poor village,"" he said in an accommodating tone.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""There isn't a decent house in it, but if it's all right with you I'll put in a good word and see what I can do to help you out.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""He did not seem to bear any ill will.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They were just being cautious—perhaps on the lookout for some prefectural official who was scheduled to come on a tour of inspection.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"With their sense of caution appeased, they were merely good, simple fisherfolk.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""I should be very grateful if you would.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, I will expect to show my appreciation… I am particularly fond of staying in village houses.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""4THE sun had set and the wind had slackened somewhat He walked along the dunes until he could no longer distinguish the pattern hewn by the wind in the sand.There seemed to be nothing that faintly resembled crops.Orthoptera—small-winged crickets and white-whiskered earwigs.Rhynchota—red-striped soldier bugs.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was not certain of the name, but surely it was a type of soldier bug.Of the sheath-winged insects which he sought: white-backed billbugs and long-legged letter-droppers.He had not been able to spot a single one of the beetle family that was his real aim.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And indeed for that very reason he was anticipating the fruits of the next day's battle.His fatigue brought faint spots of light dancing on his retina.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Then, in spite of himself, he stopped walking and fixed his eyes on the surface of the darkening dunes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was no use; anything that moved looked like a beetle.As he had promised, the old man was waiting for him in front of the cooperative offices.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"The old man said something; abruptly the laughing stopped, and he walked out leading the others.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The shell-strewn road floated vague and white in the twilight.He was escorted to one of the cavities on the ridge of the dunes at one end of the village.From the ridge a narrow path went down the slope to the right.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"After they had walked on awhile, the old man leaned over into the darkness and, clapping his hands, shouted in a loud voice: ""Hey!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

He would have had to catch hold on the cliff with his bare hands.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was almost three times the height of the house top, and even with the ladder it was still not easy to manage.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In the daytime, he recalled, the slope had seemed to him rather gentle, but as he looked at it now, it was close to perpendicular.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The ladder was an uncertain thing of rope, and if one lost one's balance it would get hopelessly tangled up.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was quite like living in a natural stronghold.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"But the person who came to meet him, holding up a lamp, was a smallish, nice sort of woman around thirty.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Perhaps she was wearing powder; for someone who lived by the sea, she was amazingly white.Anyway, he was extremely grateful for her cheerful welcome, from which she could not conceal her own pleasure.Indeed, if it had not been for the warm reception, the house itself would have been difficult to put up with at all.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He would have thought they were making a fool of him and would doubtless have gone back at once.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The walls were peeling, matting had been hung up in place of sliding doors, the upright supports were warped, boards had replaced all the windows, the straw mats were on the point of rotting and when one walked on them they made a noise like a wet sponge.Moreover, an offensive smell of burned, moldering sand floated over the whole place.Well, everything depended on one's attitude.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was disarmed by the woman's manner.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He told himself that this one night was a rare experience.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

It was certainly an environment in which insects would gkdly live.His premonition was right.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No sooner had he taken the seat offered him beside the hearth, which was sunk in the earthen floor, than all around there was the sound of what seemed to be the pitter-patter of rain.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was an army of fleas.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But he was not one to be overwhelmed by such things.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
An insect collector is always prepared.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"""Tossing the shovel on the kerosene cans which had been left out, he abruptly returned to the room, ignoring the expression on the woman's face.He spent a sleepless night, turning and tossing.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He pricked up his ears, sensing the woman's presence.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He felt somewhat guilty.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Taking such a stand in front of her was actually an expression of jealousy at what bound her; and was it not also a desire that she should put aside her work and come secretly to his bed?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Actually, his strong feelings were apparently not simply anger at female stupidity.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was something more unfathomable.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His mattress was getting damper and damper, and the sand more and more clammy to his skin.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was all too unreasonable, too eerie.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was no need to blame himself for having thrown the shovel aside and come in.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He did not have to take that much responsibility.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Besides, the obligations he had to assume were already more than enough.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In fact; his involvement with sand and his insect collecting were, after all, simply ways to escape, however temporarily, from his obligations and the inactivity of his life.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No matter how he tried, he could not sleep.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The sound of the woman's movements continued without interruption.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Again and again the sound of the basket drew near, and then receded.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
If things went on this way he would be in no condition for tomorrow's work.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The next day he would get up at daybreak, he decided, and put the day to good use.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The more he tried to sleep, the more wide awake he became.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His eyes began to smart; his tears and his blinking seemed to be ineffective against the ceaselessly falling sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He spread out a towel and wrapped it over his head.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was difficult to breathe, but it was better this way.He tried thinking of something else.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he closed his eyes, a number of long lines, flowing like sighs, came floating toward him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They were ripples of sand moving over the dunes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The dunes were probably burned onto his retina because he had been gazing steadily at them for some twelve hours.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The same sand currents had swallowed up and destroyed flourishing cities and great empires.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"They called it the""sabulation"" of the Roman Empire, if he remembered rightly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And the village of something or other, which Omar Khayyam wrote of, with its tailors and butchers, its bazaars and roadways, entwined like the strands of a fish net.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
How many years of strife and petitioning had been necessary to change just one strand!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The cities of antiquity, whose immobility no one doubted… Yet, after all, they too were unable to resist the law of the flowing 1/8-mm.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
sands.Sand…Things with form were empty when placed beside sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The only certain factor was its movement; sand was the antithesis of all form.However, beyond the thin wall of boards the woman continued shoveling as usual.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What in heaven's name could she hope to accomplish with her frail arms?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was like trying to build a house in the sea by brushing the water aside.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"You floated a ship on water in accordance with the properties of water.With that thought he was suddenly released from the compulsive feeling of oppression that, in some strange manner, the sound of the woman's shoveling exerted on him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If a ship floated on water, then it would also float on sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If they could get free from the concept of stationary houses, they wouldn't have to waste energy fighting the sands.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A ship—a house—which flowed along, borne up by the sand…shapeless towns and cities.Sand, of course, was not a liquid.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was no reason, therefore, to expect it to be buoyant.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If one were to toss something on it with a lesser specific gravity, say a cork stopper, and leave it there, even the cork would sink.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A boat that would float on sand would have to possess much different qualities.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It could be a house shaped like a barrel, for example, which would pitch and toss.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even if it heaved over a little, it would shed whatever sand had fallen on it and rise at once to the surface.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, people would not be able to endure the instability of a house that kept revolving all the time.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There would have to be a double-barrel arrangement on an axis, so that the bottom of the inner barrel would always have a fixed point of gravity.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The inner one would remain steady; only the outer one would turn.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A house which would move like the pendulum of a great clock… a cradle house… a desert ship…Villages and towns in constant movement composed of groupings of these ships… Without being aware of it, he dropped off to sleep.7HE was awakened by a cock's crow, like the creaking of a rusty swing.It was a restless, hangnail awakening.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had the feeling that it was barely dawn, but the hands of his wrist watch had already turned to 11:16.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
So the color of the sunbeams was actually that of noon.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was gloomy here because he was at the bottom of a hole and the sun had not yet reached that far.Quickly he jumped up.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The sand that had accumulated on his face, head, and chest fell away with a rustling sound.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Around his nose and lips sand was encrusted, hardened by perspiration.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He scraped it off with the back of his hand and cautiously blinked his eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Tears welled up uncontrollably under his gritty, feverish eyelids.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But the tears alone were not enough to wash away the sand that had become lodged in the moist corners of his eyes.He started toward the container on the earthen floor for a little water.Suddenly he heard the breathing of the sleeping woman on the other side of the sunken hearth and looked over.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He swallowed his breath, quite forgetting the aching of his eyelids.She was stark naked.She seemed to float like a blurred shadow before his tear-filled eyes.She lay face up on the matting, her whole body, except her head,exposed to view; she had placed her left hand lightly over her lower abdomen, which was smooth and full.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The parts that one usually covered were completely bare, while the face, which anybody would show, was concealed under a towel.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No doubt the towel was to protect her nose, mouth, and eyes from the sand, but the contrast seemed to make the naked body stand out even more.The whole surface of her body was covered with a coat of fine sand, which hid the details and brought out the feminine lines; she seemed a statue gilded with sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Suddenly a viscid saliva rose from under his tongue.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But he could not possibly swallow it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Were he to swallow, the sand that had lodged between his lips and teeth would spread through his mouth.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He turned toward the earthen floor and spat.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Yet no matter how much he ejected he could not get rid of the gritty taste.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
No matter how he emptied his mouth the sand was still there.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
More sand seemed to issue constantly from between his teeth.Fortunately the water jar had recently been replenished and was brimming full.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
When he had rinsed his mouth and washed his face he felt better.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Never before had he been so keenly aware of the marvel of water.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Water was an inorganic substance like sand, a simple, transparent, inorganic substance that adapted to the body more readily than any living thing.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As he let the water trickle slowly down his throat, he imagined stone-eating animals.Again he turned and looked towardthe woman.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But he had no desire togo any closer.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A sand-coveredwoman was perhaps attractive tolook at but hardly to touch.With daylight, the exasperation andexcitement of the preceding night seemed pure fantasy.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, the whole thing would be good material for conversation.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The man again looked around, as if to fix what had already become a memory, and hurriedly began to get ready.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His shirt and trousers were loaded with sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"However, there was no sense worrying about such things.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was more difficult to shake all the sand from the fibers of his clothes than to get the dandruff off his head.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His shoes, too, were buried in the sand.He wondered if he should say something to the woman before he left.But, on the other hand, it would only embarrass her to be awakened.Anyway, what should he do about paying her for the night's lodging?Perhaps it would be better to stop on the way back through the village and give the old man from the cooperative the money—the one who had brought him here the day before.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Stealthily he went out.The sun was boiling mercury, poised at the edge of the sand cliff.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Little by little it was beginning to heat the bottom of the hole.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He hastily turned his eyes away from the intense glare.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
In the next instant he had already forgotten it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He simply stared at the facade of the sand wall.It was unbelievable!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The rope ladder had vanished from the place it had been the night before.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The marker bags, half buried by the sand, were perfectly visible.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was no mistake, he remembered the spot.He wondered: Had the ladder alone been swallowed up by the sand?He rushed to the wall and sank his arms into the sand, groping for it.The sand gave way, unresisting, and ran down.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"However, he wasn't trying to find a needle in a haystack; if he did not succeed with the first try, he never would, no matter how much he searched.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Stifling his rising apprehension, he looked again in blank amazement at the abruptness of the slope.Wasn't there some spot where it could be scaled?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
he wondered.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He circled the house two or three times, looking.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he climbed up on the roof of the house, the distance to the rim of the hole would be shortest on the north side, toward the sea, but it would still be over thirty feet And, what was more, the wall there was steeper than anywhere else.The massive brow of sand which hung down seemed exceedingly dangerous.The west wall seemed to be a comparatively gentle incline, having a curved surface like the inside of a cone.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At an optimistic estimate it was probably around fifty or even forty-five degrees.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Cautiously he took a probing step.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
With each step forward he slid back a half step.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even so, it looked as though he could make it with a very great effort.Things went as he had expected for the first five or six steps.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And then his feet began to sink into the sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Before he knew whether he was making progress or not, he was buried up to his knees and seemed to have lost all power of movement.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Then he attempted frantically to scramble up on all fours.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The burning sand scorched his palms.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Sweat poured from his whole body.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Sand and sweat blinded him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Soon he had cramps in his legs and was unable to move them at all.He stopped struggling and caught his breath, assuming he had already covered a considerable distance, but when he opened his eyes, squinting, he was amazed to find that he had come not even five yards.What exactly had he accomplished by all this effort?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"he wondered.Moreover, the incline he had climbed seemed to be far steeper than when he had looked at it from below.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And above where he stood, it looked even worse.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Although he had wanted to climb up, he seemed to have spent all his energy simply burrowing into the sand wall.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The brow of sand just above his face blocked his path.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In desperation he tried to struggle on a little further, but the instant he reached out for the sand over his head his footing gave way.He was spewed out from the sand and flung to the bottom of the hole.His left shoulder made a sound like the splitting of chopsticks.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But he did not notice any pain.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
For some time fine sand rustled gently down the face of the cliff as if to ease the hurt he had received; then it stopped.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Anyway, his injury was an exceedingly small one.It was still too soon to be frightened.He stifled a desire to scream and slowly crept back to the hut.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The woman was still sleeping in the same position.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He called her, gently at first and then in a louder and louder voice.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Instead of answering, she turned over as though annoyed.The sand ran from her body, revealing her bare arms and shoulders, the nakedness of her flanks and loins.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But there were more important things to think of.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Going to her, he tore the towel from her head.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Her face was covered with blotches, and, compared with her body, which had been encased in sand, it was gruesomely raw.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The strange whiteness of her face the night before in the lamplight must surely have been produced by a powder.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Now the white stuff had rubbed away, leaving bald patches that gave the impression of a cheap cutlet not cooked in batter.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"With surprise he realized that the white stuff was perhaps real wheat flour.Finally she half opened her eyes, seeming to be dazzled by the light.Seizing her shoulders and shaking her, the man spoke rapidly and imploringly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Say, the ladder's gone!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Where's the best place to climb out of here, for heaven's sake?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You can't get out of a place like this without a ladder.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""She gathered up the towel with a nervous gesture, and with unexpected energy slapped her face with it two or three times and then, completely turning her back to him, crouched with her knees doubled beneath her and her face to the floor.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Was it a bashful movement?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
This was hardly the place.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The man let out a shout as if a dam had given way.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""This is no joking matter!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I don't know what I'll do if you don't get that ladder out.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I'm in a hurry!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Where in God's name did you hide it?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I've had enough of your pranks.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Give it here.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At once!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""But she did not answer.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She remained in the same position, simply shaking her head left and right.He stiffened.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His vision blurred, his breathing faltered and almost stopped; he abruptly realized the pointlessness of his questioning.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The ladder was of rope.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A rope ladder couldn't stand up by itself.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even if he got his hands on it there was no possibility of setting it up from below—which meant that the woman had not taken it down, but someone else had taken it away from the road above.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His unshaven face, smudged with sand, suddenly looked miserable.The woman's actions and her silence took on an unexpected and terrible meaning.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He refused to believe it, yet in his heart he knew his worst fears had come true.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The ladder had probably been removed with her knowledge, and doubtless with her full consent.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Unmistakably she was an accomplice.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course her posture had nothing to do with embarrassment; it was the posture of a sacrificial victim, of a criminal willing to accept any punishment.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had been lured by the beetle into a desert from which there was no escape—like some famished mouse.He sprang up and, hurrying to the door, looked out again.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The wind had risen.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The sun was almost directly over the hole.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Heat waves, glistening as if alive, rose from the burning sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The sand cliff towered higher and higher above him; its omniscient face seemed to tell his muscles and bones the meaninglessness of resistance.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The hot air penetrated his skin.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The temperature began to rise higher.As if he had gone mad, he began to yell—he did not know what, his words were without meaning.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He simply shouted with all the strength of his voice, as though he could make the bad dream come to its senses, excuse itself for its blundering, and whisk him from the bottom of the hole.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But his voice, unaccustomed to shouting, was fragile and wan.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Moreover, his words were absorbed by the sand and blown by the wind, and there was no way of knowing how far they reached.Suddenly a horrible sound interrupted him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As the woman had predicted the night before, the brow of sand on the north side had lost its moisture and collapsed.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The whole house seemed to let out a soulful shriek, as if mortally wounded, and a gray blood began to drop down with a rustling sound from the new gap between the eaves and the wall.The man began to tremble, his mouth full of saliva.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was as if his own body had been crushed.This entire nightmare could not be happening.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was too outlandish.Was it permissible to snare, exactly like a mouse or an insect, a man who had his certificate of medical insurance, someone who had paid his taxes, who was employed, and whose family records were in order?He could not believe it.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps there was some mistake; it was bound to be a mistake.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was nothing to do but assume that it was a mistake.First of all, there was no point at all in doing what they had done to him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was not a horse or a cow; they could not force him to work against his will.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Since he was useless as manpower, there was no sense in shutting him up within these walls of sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It simply inflicted a dependent on the woman.But somehow he was not sure.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Looking at the sand wall that encircled him as if to strangle him, he was unpleasantly reminded of his miserable failure to scale it.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had simply floundered about.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A feeling of impotence paralyzed his whole body.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The village was already corroded by the sand, common everyday conventions were not observed; perhaps it had become a world apart For that matter, if he wanted to be suspicious, there was plenty to be suspicious about.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"For example, if it was true that the kerosene cans and the shovel had been prepared especially for him, it was also true that the rope ladder had been removed without his knowing it.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Furthermore, the fact that the woman had not offered a word of explanation, that she had silently accepted everything with a strange submissive-ness, lent substance to the danger in the situation.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The woman's remark the night before, intimating that his stay was to be a long one, had perhaps not been a mere slip of the tongue.Then there was a small avalanche of sand.Apprehensively, he returned to the hut.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He went directly to the woman, who had remained crouching.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He raised his left hand threateningly.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His eyes glittered as he stood there agonizing.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But halfway through the gesture, his arm, which he had raised with such purpose, suddenly collapsed.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps he would feel better if he slapped the naked woman.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But wouldn't this be just the part he was expected to play?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She was waiting for it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Punishment inflicted, in other words, would mean that the crime had been paid for.He turned his back on her, sank down on the ramp around the raised part of the floor, and cradled his head in his arms.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Without raising his voice he began to groan.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He tried to swallow the saliva that had gathered in his mouth, but it stuck in his throat and he gagged.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The mucous lining of his throat had become hypersensitive to the presence of the sand; he would never get used to it no matter how long he stayed there.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His saliva had become a brownish scum that oozed from the corners of his mouth.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
When he had finished spitting he could feel the harshness of the sand even more.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He tried to dislodge it, running the tip of his tongue over the inside of his mouth and repeatedly spitting, but there was no end to it.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His mouth was parched and hot, as if some inflammation had set in.It was no use.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Anyway, he would talk to the woman and try to get her to explain things more precisely.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If the situation were clarified, perhaps he could decide on an attack.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He could not be without a plan of action.Such a stupid situation was unbearable.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But what would he do if she would not answer?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"That, indeed, would be the most ominous response of all.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And there was ample possibility of it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Her stubborn silence!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The way she seemed like a defenseless victim, crouching there with her knees drawn up under her!The sight of her naked back was indecent and animal-like.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She looked as though she could be flipped over just by bringing his hand up her crotch.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No sooner had the thought crossed his mind than he caught his breath, ashamed.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had the feeling it would not be long before he would see himself as an executioner, torturing the woman, standing over her sand-spattered buttocks.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yes, eventually it would happen.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And in that movement he would lose his right to speak.Suddenly a piercing pain stuck his belly.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His bladder, apparently swollen to the breaking point, cried out for relief.8HE finished urinating and, stupefied with despair, remained standing as he was in the heavy air.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was no hope that things would be better as time went by.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Yet he could not bring himself to go back into the house.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
When he left the woman's side he realized all the more how hazardous it was to be with her.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No, he thought, the problem was not she herself, but that crouching position.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had never seen anything quite so indecent.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was out of the question to go back in to her.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In every way that position of hers was exceedingly dangerous.Certain types of insects and spiders, when unexpectedly attacked, fall into a paralytic state, a kind of epileptic seizure… an airport whose control tower has been seized by lunatics… a fragmented picture.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He wanted to believe that his own lack of movement had stopped all movement in the world, the way a hibernating frog abolishes winter.As his thoughts ran on, the rays of the sun had become even more intense.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He made a sudden bending movement as if to protect himself from the spear thrusts of light.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Abruptly lowering his head, he grasped his shirt collar and pulled with all his might.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The three top buttons flew off.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Scraping away the sand that clung to his palms, he remembered once again the words of the woman the night before—to the effect that the sand was never dry but always moist enough to cause the gradual disintegration of anything it touched.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he had taken off his shirt, he loosened his belt and let the air circulate inside his trousers.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But it was nothing to make such a fuss about.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The unpleasant feeling left him as quickly as it had come.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The moisture in the sand evidently lost its magical powers as soon as it came into contact with air.At that instant it came to him that he had made a serious mistake.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His interpretation of the woman's nakedness would seem to be too arbitrary.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Though he could not rule out some secret wish on her part to seduce him, perhaps this nakedness was a very ordinary habit, made necessary by the life she led.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"After all, she did go to bed when it got light.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Anyone is apt to perspire while asleep.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Her nakedness was perfectly normal seeing that she had to sleep during the day and, what was more, in a bowl of burning sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he were in her position, he would certainly choose to be naked too if he could.This realization suddenly eased his feelings of tension, as if the fluttering breeze had visibly separated the sweat from the sand on his skin.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was no use stirring up groundless fears.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Men have escaped through any number of concrete walls and iron bars.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He would not quail simply at the sight of a padlock without finding out whether it was locked or not.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He went slowly back in the direction of the hut, dragging his feet in the sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"This time he would be composed, and he would get the necessary information out of her.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"By getting himself in such a state and screaming at her, he could only expect her to clam up.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Besides, her silence was probably only shame at having been careless enough to be caught sleeping naked.9To his eyes, recently exposed to the burning sand, the interior of the hut lay in semi-darkness and felt cool and damp.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The hot air had a stuffy, musty smell, quite different from the outside.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But suddenly he was aware of what had to be a hallucination.The woman was not there.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
For a moment he was startled.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had had enough of guessing games.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But there was no riddle to be solved.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She was there.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She stood looking down, her back toward him, in front of the water jar by the sink.She had finished dressing.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had no fault to find with her.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The color of her matching bluish-green kimono and work trousers gave him a sense of mintlike freshness.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Indeed, he was worrying too much.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Between lack of sleep and the strange environment, he could scarcely help but have wild fancies.The woman put one hand on the rim of the water jar and peered into itj with the tip of a finger she slowly stirred the surface of the water round and round.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He vigorously swung his shirt in the air—it was heavy with the dampness of sweat and sand—and wound it firmly around his wrist.She looked around apprehensively, and her features tensed.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Her solicitous manner was so natural that one would have thought she had spent her whole life with such an expression on her face.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He decided to behave as casually as possible.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Hot, isn't it?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Heavens, you can't wear a shirt when it's this hot!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Yet she still appeared suspicious and looked dolefully at him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She gave a timid and artificial laugh, and spoke hesitantly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Yes, it really is.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You'll get a sand rash right away if you leave your clothes on when you perspire.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"""She was silent.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She showed no sign of offering any explanation.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She waited a moment, and when it was evident he had stopped speaking, she slowly turned as if nothing had happened and resumed her unfinished work.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She slid back the cover over the top of the closet and crawled up, working the upper part of her body into the aperture with her elbows and wiggling her legs clumsily.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The sand began to fall in thin rivulets here and there.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had the feeling that there was some strange insect inside the ceiling.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Sand and rotted wood.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No, thank you, he had had enough of strange things!Then from one corner of the ceiling the sand began to pour out dizzily in numerous tapelike streams.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The strange quietness was in eerie contrast to the violence of the flow of sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The holes and cracks in the ceiling boards were quickly raised in exact relief on the straw matting.The sand burned in his nose and irritated his eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He fled out of the house.Suddenly he felt as though he were melting away from his feet upward into a landscape of flame.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But something like a perpetual shaft of ice remained in the center of his body.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He felt ashamed in some way.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"An animal-like woman… thinking only in terms of today… no yesterday, no tomorrow… with a dot for a heart.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A world where people were convinced that men could be erased like chalk maiks from a blackboard.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
In his wildest dreams he could not have imagined that such barbarism still existed anywhere in the world.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Well, anyway… if this was a sign that he was beginning to regain his composure and recover from his initial shock, his qualms of conscience were not a bad thing.But he must not waste time.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If possible, he would like to finish before it got dark.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Squinting, he measured the height of the sand wall quivering behind a film of heat waves like molten glass.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Every time he looked at it, it seemed to grow higher.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It would be hard to go against nature and try to make a gentle slope abrupt—he only wanted to try to make a steep one more gentle.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was no reason to hang back.The best way to do it, of course, would be to shave it down gradually from the top.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Since this was impossible, he had no choice but to dig from the bottom.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"First he would scoop out a suitable amount of sand from below and wait for the sand above to cave in, then he would scoop more out and again let the top fall in.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he repeated this again and again, the ground level he stood on would gradually rise and ultimately reach the top.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, he might also be carried away by the flowing sand in the midst of the operation.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But no matter how much sand flowed, it still wasn't water, and he had never yet heard about anyone being drowned in sand.The shovel was standing with the kerosene cans against the outside wall that went around the earthen floor.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The dented edge of the shovel gleamed white like a piece of cracked porcelain.For some time he concentrated on digging.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The sand was exceedingly tractable, and his work appeared to be progressing.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The sound of the shovel as it bit into the sand, and his own breathing, ticked away the time.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"However, at last his arms began to grow weary.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He thought he had worked for a considerable time, but his digging had apparently had no results at all.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Only a little bit of sand had fallen from right above where he was digging.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Somehow, it was working out very differently from the simple geometric process he had evolved in his head.Rather than worry further, he decided to take advantage of a rest period and put his theory to the test by constructing a model of the hole.Fortunately, materials were plentiful.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He chose a spot in the shade of the eaves and dug a hollow about a half yard wide.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But the incline of the slope did not make the angle he had anticipated; it was only forty-five degrees at the most, about like a wide-mouthed mixing bowl.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he tried scooping sand from the bottom, the sand flowed down the sides, but the incline remained the same.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There would appear to be a fixed angle for sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The weight and resistance of the grains seemed to be in perfect balance.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Supposing this were true, did the wall he was trying to overcome have about the same degree of incline?No, that could not be.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It might bean illusion, but it could not be true.When you looked at any inclinefrom below it obviously appearedless than it actually was.Then, shouldn't he perhapsconsider it to be a question of quantity?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The pressure would naturally change with different amounts of sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If the pressure changed, a variation in the balance of weight and resistance would naturally occur.Perhaps it depended on the nature of the sand grains.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Clay that has been packed down and clay from a natural deposit have completely different resistance to pressure.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Furthermore, he had to consider the question of moisture.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In short, another law was probably functioning, different from the one that applied to the model he had made.Despite his failure, the experiment was not completely in vain.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The very fact that he now realized that the slope of the wall was in what he might call a superstable state was an important find.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Generally it is not particularly difficult to make a superstable state into a normally stable one.A supersaturated solution, just by being shaken, at once produces a crystalline precipitate and moves toward the normal saturation point.Suddenly he had the feeling that someone was near; he turned around.He had been unaware of the woman, who was standing in the doorway staring fixedly at him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was understandably embarrassed and took a step back in confusion, glancing around as if in search of help.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He raised his eyes, and there at the top of the east bank were three men, all in a row, looking down at him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"They wore towels wrapped around their heads; as they were not visible from the mouth down, he could not be sure, but they seemed to be the old men of the day before.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At once he straightened up, but just as suddenly he changed his mind and decided to ignore them and go on with his work.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The fact that he was being watched spurred him on.The perspiration ran into his eyes and dripped from the end of his nose.Since there was no time to wipe it away, he just closed his eyes and shoveled.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Under no condition must he rest his arms.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When they saw his unflagging pace, they would realize, unless they were dim-wits, how despicable they were.He looked at his watch.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He wiped it against his pants to remove the sand on its face; it was only 2:10.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The same ten minutes after two as when he had looked before.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He suddenly lost confidence in his pace.From a snail's point of view the sun probably moves with the speed of a baseball.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He changed his grip on the shovel, and turning back again to the wall, he set frantically to work.Suddenly the flow of sand grew violent.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was a muffled sound and then a pressure against his chest.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He tried to look up to see what was happening, but he no longer had any sense of direction.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was only dimly aware of a faint milky light playing over him as he lay doubled up in the black splotch of his vomit.PART II11""Jabu, jabu, jabu, jabuWhat sound is that?It's the sound of the bell.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Jabu, jabu, jabu, jabuWhat voice is that?It's the voice of the devil.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""THE woman sang as if murmuring to herself, tirelessly repeating the same verses as she scooped the slime from the water jar.When the song stopped, the sound of rice being ground came to his ears.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He sighed gently, rolled over, and waited, his body tight with expectancy.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Soon the woman brought a washbasin filled with water, probably to sponge off his body.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His skin, which was puffy from sand and perspiration, was becoming inflamed.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He lay there anticipating thf cool, damp towel.He had been in bed ever since he had fainted in the sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
For the first two days he had had a fever of around a hundred and had vomited constantly.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But on the following day the fever had dropped and he had partially recovered his appetite.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The basic cause was probably not the injury he had received in the sand avalanche, but the unaccustomed exertion he had kept up for so long, exposed to the direct rays of the sun.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Anyway, in the long run, it hadn't amounted to much.That was probably why he recovered so quickly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
On the fourth day the pain in his legs and loins had almost gone away.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"On the fifth, except for a certain heaviness, no more symptoms were apparent.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Nevertheless, he stayed in bed, giving an outward show of being seriously ill; but of course there was motive and calculation in this.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Naturally, he had not for a moment abandoned his plans for escape.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"""She was calling to him timidly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Out of the corner of his half-closed eyes he noticed the roundness of her knee through her work trousers.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He answered her with a wordless groan.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Slowly squeezing out the towel in the dented brass washbasin, she asked: ""How do you feel?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

His sand-clogged skin was suddenly cool and fresh again.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The odor of the woman slipped over his quickened body, subtly stimulating him.Even so, he could not completely forgive her.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

There was not even a sign that the rope ladder had been let down.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"What he had to do was make them recognize that he was no longer of any use for work—at all events, get them to relax their vigilance.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"A tower of illusion, all of it, made of illusory bricks and full of holes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If life were made up only of important things, it really would be a dangerous house of glass, scarcely to be handled carelessly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But everyday life was exactly like the headlines.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And so everybody, knowing the meaninglessness of existence, sets the center of his compass at his own home.Suddenly his eyes fell on a surprising article.About 8:00 A.M. on the fourteenth, at the East Asia Housing construction site, 30 Yokokawa-ch6, a scoop-truck driver for the Hinohara Co., Mr. Tashiro Tsutomu (aged 28), received serious injuries when he was buried under a sand slide.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was taken to a nearby hospital but died shortly after arrival.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"According to the investigation carried out by the Yokokawa police, the cause of the accident appears to be that too much sand was removed from the lower part of a thirty-foot pile that was being leveled.Aha!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Doubtless this was the article that the villagers had intended him to see.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They had not responded to his request for nothing.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was commendable that they had not circled the section in red ink.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was reminded of the dangerous weapon they called a blackjack.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A blackjack is made by packing sand into a leather sack.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It is said to have a striking power comparable to that of an iron or lead bar.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No matter how sand flowed, it was still different from water.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"One could swim in water, but sand would enfold a man and crush him to death.It looked as though he had misjudged the situation.14HE needed some time for thought before deciding on a new strategy.Four hours must have passed since the woman had gone out to clear away the sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The second group of basket carriers had finished their appointed work and were returning in the direction of the three-wheeled truck.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"After he had made certain, straining his ears, that the men were not coming back, he quietly arose and put on his clothes.Since the woman had taken the lamp away with her, he had to do everything by touch.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His shoes were brimful of sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He tucked the cuffs of his trousers into his socks, then took out his leggings and thrust them into his pocket.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He decided to gather his insect-collecting equipment together near the door so that he could find it easily.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Thanks to the thick carpet of sand on the earthen floor, there was no need to be cautious about his footsteps.The woman was completely preoccupied with her work.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Her movements were smooth as she cut into the sand; her breathing was strong and regular.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Her elongated shadow danced around the lamp at her feet.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The man, concealing himself at the corner of the building, forced himself to breathe softly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
In his hands he grasped the two ends of a towel and stretched it taut; after counting ten he would make a dash for it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His attack had to come at the instant she leaned forward to shovel up the heap of sand.Of course, he could not pretend there was absolutely no danger.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was no telling—their attitude might suddenly change in a half hour.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"For instance, there was that government man.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The old man from the village had at first mistaken him for the government man and shown signs of extreme caution.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They must have expected the government man to make an inspection in the near future.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If that were so, village opinion would split over him, and they might possibly give up keeping him prisoner and concealing his existence.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But by the same token there was no guarantee that a half hour would not stretch into a half year, a year, or even more.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was a fifty-fifty chance whether it would be a year or a half hour, and he was certainly not ready to lay a wager.When he considered that relief might be at hand, he realized that things would go better for him if he were to continue with his pretext of illness.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But this was indeed the point that perplexed him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He lived under a constitutional government, and therefore it was natural that he should expect help.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
People who vanished in a fog of mystery and remained incommunicado frequently wanted to do just that.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As long as the case didn't seem to be of a criminal nature, it would be entrusted to the civil rather than the criminal authorities, and thus even the police could not go too far into the matter.But in his case the situation was completely different, and he was desperately reaching out for help.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Anyone who saw his empty room would immediately understand what had happened, even if they hadn't seen him or directly heard from him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The unfinished book that lay open to the page he had been reading when he put it down… the small change he had tossed into the pocket of his office clothes… his bankbook, which bore no trace of any recent withdrawals, despite the small amount in his account… his box of drying insects he had not yet finished arranging… the stamped envelope containing the order blank for a new collecting bottle, laid out ready for mailing—all this repudiated discontinuance, everything pointed to his intention to go on living.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A visitor could not help but hear the plaintive voice from the room.Well… if it hadn't been for that letter… if it just hadn't been for that stupid letter.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yet that was the point, it had been.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In his dream he had told the truth, but now he was quibbling with himself.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Why?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had made enough excuses.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Lost articles no longer existed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And he had long since cut his throat with his own hands.He had assumed an unreasonably mysterious attitude about this holiday, saying nothing to any of his colleagues about his intended destination.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Not only had he left without saying a word, but he had deliberately made a point of the mystery.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There couldn't be a more efficient way of teasing his colleagues, glum and gray with their daily gray routine.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He sank into an unbearable self-aversion with the thought that among the glum and gray, people other than he had colors other than gray—red, blue, green.It only happened in novels or movies that summer was filled with dazzling sun.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"What existed in reality were humble, small-town Sundays… a man taking his snooze under the political columns of a newspaper, enveloped in gunsmoke… canned juices and thermos jugs with magnetized caps… boats for hire, fifty cents an hour—queue up here… foaming beaches with the leaden scum of dead fish… and then, at the end, a jam-packed trolley rickety with fatigue.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Everyone knows this is fact, but no one wants to make a fool of himself and be taken in; so, on the gray canvas of reality, he zestfully sketches the mere form of this illusory festival.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Miserable, unshaven fathers, shaking their complaining children by the shoulder trying to make them say it has been a pleasant Sunday… little scenes everyone has seen in the corner of some trolley… people's pathetic jealousy and impatience with others'happiness.Well, if that were all, it was nothing to get so serious about.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If the Mobius man had not had the same reaction as his other colleagues, it was doubtful whether he would have been so obstinate.He had tentatively trusted the man, a pop-eyed fellow, who always looked as if he had just washed his face and who was enthusiastic about unions.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had once sincerely tried revealing his inner thoughts, which he seldom disclosed to anyone.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""What do you think?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I have considerable doubt about a system of education that imputes meaning to life.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""What do you mean by 'meaning'?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""In other words, an illusory education that makes one believe that something is when it really isn't.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Therefore I'm very interested in sand in this instance, because, even though it's a solid, it has definite hydrodynamic properties.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The other, perplexed, had bent forward, arching his back like a cat.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But his expression, as before, had remained open.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had not appeared to find the idea particularly unpleasant.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Someone had once commented that the man resembled a Mobius strip.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A Mobius strip is a length of paper, twisted once, the two ends of which are pasted together, thus forming a surface that has neither front nor back.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Had they meant that this man's union life and his private life formed a Mobius circle?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He remembered feeling a certain admiration for the man, and at the same time cynicism.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""In other words, do you mean realistic education?""""No.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The reason I brought up the example of sand was because in the final analysis I rather think the world is like sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The fundamental nature of sand is very difficult to grasp when you think of it in its stationary state.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Sand not only flows, but this very flow is the sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I'm sorry I can't express it better.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""But I understand what you mean.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Because in practical education you can't avoid getting involved in relativism, can you?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""No, that's not it.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You yourself become sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You see with the eyes of sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Once you're dead you don't have to worry about dying any more.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""You must be an idealist.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I think you must be afraid of your students—aren't you?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""I am, because I think my students are something like sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The man had laughed heartily, showing his white teeth, but- not once had he appeared disturbed by the discordant exchange.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His pop-eyes had quite disappeared between the folds of skin.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Jumpei had not been able to repress a vague smile.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The other was really quite like a Mobius circle.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was indeed a Mobius circle—in both a good and a bad sense.On the good face of it, he really deserved praise.But, speaking of a Mobius circle, the other had frankly shown the same gray envy of his holiday as his colleagues had.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It seemed a far cry from a Mobius circle.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was disappointed, but at the same time pleased.Anyone was apt to be ill-natured with virtue.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And so, he had come, to take increasing pleasure in his teasing.And then the letter… the irretrievable card that had already been delivered.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The obsession in his dream the night before had had a very definite cause.It would be false to claim that there was absolutely no love between him and the other woman.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was simply that theirs was a somewhat obscure relationship in which, mutually at odds as they were, he could never be sure of her.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If, for example, he were to say that marriage was, in the final analysis, like cultivating undeveloped land, she would retort, angrily and unreasonably, that it meant having to make a cramped house bigger.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Or, if he were to say the opposite, she would still take the contrary stand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was a seesaw game that had been tirelessly repeated for a full two years and four months.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Perhaps it would be better to say that, rather than losing their passion, they had frozen it by over-idealizing it.And then he had decided quite suddenly to let her know by letter that he had gone off alone for a time and had purposely told no one of his destination.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The mystery of his holiday, which would have such effect on his colleagues, would not produce any reaction from her.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But he had thought the letter stupid and had tossed it, stamped and addressed, on his desk and come away.This innocent act, as a result, was to be the automatic, thiefproof lock that only the owner could open.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The letter was almost certain to catch someone's eye.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was as though he had purposely left a statement that he had disappeared of his own volition.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was just like some moronic criminal who, observed at the scene of his crime, had thereupon stupidly wiped away his fingerprints and thus proved his criminal intent.His opportunity for escape receded into the distance.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yet, though he still clung to the possibility of rescue even now, his hopes would agonize in the poison of his doubts.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Now the only way was to break open the doors by force without waiting for them to be opened.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was no excuse for hesitating any longer.He dug his toes into the sand until they hurt, leaned forward, and prepared to spring out at the count of ten.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But still he hesitated, even at the count of thirteen.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At last, taking four deep breaths, he dashed out.15IN spite of his intention, his movements were sluggish, for his strength had been sapped by the sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Already the woman had turned around and, with her shovel poised, was gazing at him in blank surprise.If she really wanted to put up resistance, the result could be completely different from what he hoped.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But his stratagem of taking her by surprise was completely successful.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had been too eager, but the woman was paralyzed.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The thought of pushing him back with her poised shovel apparently never occurred to her.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Don't cry out.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I won't hurt you.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Just keep quiet.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""He kept whispering to her in a tense voice, haphazardly stuffing a towel into her mouth.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She remained as he put her, without resisting—even in the face of this reckless, bungling act.Finally he pulled himself together when he realized her passiveness.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He withdrew the towel, which he had already half stuffed in, and rearranged it over her mouth, tying it firmly at the back of her neck.Then he bound her hands tightly behind her back with the leggings he had ready in his pocket.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""All right!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Get in the house!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The woman's spirit seemed greatly weakened, and she was not only submissive to his acts but obedient to his words as well.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She showed no resistance or antagonism.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps she was in a kind of hypnotized state.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He did not feel he had handled the situation particularly well, but his unexpected violence had apparently had the effect of taking all resistance out of her.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He forced her up to the raised portion of flooring.And with the other legging he tied her legs together at the ankles.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In the dark he had to proceed by feel, and just to be on the safe side he wrapped the remaining portion of the leggings once again around her ankles.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Now, don't move!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Do you understand?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You won't get hurt as long as you behave yourself.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But I'm desperate___""He kept looking in the direction of the woman's breathing as he backed away toward the door.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"From there, he dashed out, grabbed the shovel and the lamp, and ran back with them at once.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The woman had fallen down on her side and was working her jaw up and down repeatedly as she breathed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She was probably pushing her jaw forward with each breath in order to avoid inhaling sand from the matting.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And when she exhaled, on the other hand, she appeared to force the breath from her nose, thereby blowing the sand away from around her face.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Well, you'll have to put up with this for a while.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You'll have to be patient until the villagers come back with the baskets.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There's no reason for you to complain after the nonsense I've had to put up with.Besides, I'll pay honest board.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, only the actual expenses I calculate myself.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"You can't mind that, can you?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Really, my stay here should be free, but I can't stand not canceling such a debt.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I'm going to make you take it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""For some time, nervous and agitated, holding out his collar to let in the air, he strained his ears for signs of life outside.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yes, it might be better to extinguish the lamp.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He lifted the chimney and was about to blow—but no, before that he had better check on the woman.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The knots were tight enough on her legs; there was not even room to insert a finger.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Her wrists were already swollen a dark red, and her spatulate fingernails had turned the color of an old ink smear.The gag too was perfect.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She had drawn her dull-colored lips so taut there was almost no blood in them, and she appeared almost ghostly.Saliva dribbled out of her mouth and made a dark stain on the matting under her cheek.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
With the wavering of the lamp he seemed to hear her voiceless screams.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""It's no use.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"You started the whole thing yourself anyway,"" he said quickly without thinking.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""We've tried to get the best of each other, and we're about even, aren't we?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"I'm human too, and you can't simply tie me up like a dog.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Anybody would call it legitimate self-defense on my part.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Suddenly the woman twisted her neck and tried to catch sight of him out of the corner of her half-closed eyes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""What's wrong?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Do you want to say something?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""She moved her neck awkwardly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was as if she were nodding assent, or even dissent.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He drew the lamp closer and tried to read her eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He could not immediately believe what he saw.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"They were filled with infinite sorrow, in which there was neither bitterness nor hatred, and she seemed to be appealing for something.Impossible.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It must be his own imagination.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Expression in the eyes"" is really only a figure of speech.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
How can expression exist in an eyeball that has no muscle?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even so, he winced and stretched out his hands to loosen the gag.He drew them back and hastily blew out the lamp.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The voices of the basket carriers were drawing close.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He placed the darkened lamp on the edge of the ramp around the raised portion of the floor so that he could find it easily and, putting his lips to the kettle under the sink, took a drink of water.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"With the shovel clutched in his hands, he concealed himself by the door.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He began to perspire.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It would be soon now.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He would have to be patient for five or ten minutes more.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"With one hand he drew his collecting box close to him.16""HEY, there!""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A hoarse voice rang out.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""What are you doing down there?""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Another voice, vibrant and still young, echoed the first.The man was enclosed in the palpable darkness of the hole.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But outside, the moon had evidently risen, and the shadows of men on the line between the sand and the sky were an indistinct, expanding blob.He edged closer, hugging the bottom of the hole, his shovel in his right hand.A coarse laugh sounded at the top of the cliff.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

Where in God's name should he start on this equation filled with unknowns?The woman stood up and slowly walked toward the door.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Where are you going?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""She mumbled something as if avoiding him, and he could hardly catch what she had said.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But he understood her embarrassment.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At length, from just beyond the board wall, came a quiet sound of urinating.Somehow everything seemed futile.19How true.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Time cannot be spurred on like a horse.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But it is not quite so slow as a pushcart.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Gradually the morning temperature attained its usual intensity; his eyeballs and brain began to seethe; the heat pierced his innards; his lungs burned.The moisture that the sand had absorbed during the night became vapor and was belched back into the atmosphere.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The sand gave out a light which, through the refracted sunshine, made it seem like wet asphalt.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yet basically it remained the unadulterated 1/8 mm., drier than plain flour baked in a tin.Soon came the first sand slide.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was a noise he was used to, one that had become a part of the daily routine, but involuntarily he and the woman exchanged glances.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What would be the consequences of having let the sand go for a day?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"While he did not think they would be serious, he was still worried.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But the woman turned her eyes away in silence.Her sulky look gave the impression that he could worry alone as he pleased.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He'd be damned if he'd ask her any more.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Just when the sand slide seemed to thin out to a thread, it widened again to the size of a belt; it repeated the process by fits and starts and at length quietly ceased.It certainly did not seem serious enough to worry about.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He heaved a sigh; the pulse pounded in his face, and he felt a burning sensation.The thought of the cheap sake"", which he had tried not to think about until then, suddenly began to draw his nerves to a point, like a flame floating in darkness.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Anything would be all right; he wanted to moisten his throat.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he let things go on as they were, the blood in his body would dwindle away.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He knew full well that he was sowing the seeds of his suffering and that later he would regret it, but he could resist no longer.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He took out the stopper, thrust the bottle to his lips, and drank.Yet his tongue, like a faithful watchdog surprised by an unexpected intruder, set up a howl.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He choked.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was like sprinkling alcohol on a cut.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Nonetheless, he could not control a desire for a second and even a third swallow.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What horrible sake!Since the woman was there he offered her some too.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, she declined.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Her refusal was as exaggerated as if he were forcing her to take poison.As he had feared, the alcohol in his stomach bounced to his head like a ping-pong ball, ringing like the buzz of a bee in his ears.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His skin began to stiffen like pig's hide.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His blood was spoiling!… His blood was dying away!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

What a situation.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"Granted that obligation is a man's passport among his fellow men, why did he have to get a permit from the villagers?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Human life shouldn't be so many bits of paper scattered about.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Life is a bound diary, and one first page is plenty for one book.There is no need to do one's duty for a page that is unrelated to the preceding ones.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
One can't get involved every time someone else is on the point of starvation.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Damn it!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He wanted water.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But no matter how much he wanted water, he still did not have enough bodies to go around to all the funeral services of people who were of no consequence to him.A second sand slide began.The woman stood up and took down a broom from the wall.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

For a moment everything seemed misty with sand that fell from the ceiling.The consequences of having stopped the shoveling were at last apparent.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The sand, having no way out, was bearing down.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The joints of the beams and uprights groaned in agony.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But the woman, staring fixedly at an inner lintel, did not appear particularly concerned.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The pressure still seemed to be only around the base of the house.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Damn them!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Do they really intend going on like this forever?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""His racing heart!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"It seemed ready to crawl in anywhere—his mouth, his ears, or even into his bowel.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His spittle had become much more viscid.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And the dryness in his throat was as bad.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps it was because his thirst had not been adequately slaked by the cheap sake*.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As soon as the alcohol was dissipated, it would flare up again, and the flames would reduce him to ashes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""They must feel fine… doing such things.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They don't have the brains of a mouse.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Just what would they do if I died?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The woman raised her face as if to say something but, suddenly thinking better of it, maintained her unbroken silence.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She apparently did not think it worthwhile to answer at all.All right.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If there was to be only one inevitable ending anyway, why didn't he try whatever he could?He gulped down another mouthful from the bottle of sake"" and, bracing himself, hurried outside.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He reeled back as if molten lead had struck his eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The sand, which spilled over into the hollows left by his feet, eddied in whirlpools.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Over there was surely the place he had attacked the woman and tied her up the night before.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The shovel must surely be buried nearby.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The sand slide had mostly stopped for a while, but even so, on the cliff toward the sea, the sand continued its ceaseless flow.From time to time, blown by the wind, it would drop from the face of the cliff, fluttering like a piece of cloth.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Taking care not to start a slide, he fished around with the toes of one foot.Although he probed deeply, his foot met no resistance at all.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The direct rays of the sun soon became unbearable.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The pupils of his eyes were compressed to pin points, and his belly began to throb like a jellyfish.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A violent pain pierced his forehead.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He must not lose any more perspiration.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
This was the limit.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He wondered what he could have done with the shovel.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had taken it out with the intention of using it as a weapon; that was certain.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
So it must be around.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Peering closely at the surface of the ground, he was suddenly aware that at one point the sand was standing out in a ridge in the form of the shovel.He began to spit but hastily stopped himself.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He must retain in his body even the slightest bit of moisture.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He separated the spittle from the sand between his teeth and his lips and with the end of his finger scraped off only the portion that remained clinging to his teeth.The woman, facing the other way in a corner of the room, was doing something with the front of her kimono.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps she was unloosening her waistband or brushing off the sand which had accumulated.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He grasped the shovel halfway down the handle and brought it up to the level of his shoulders.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Aiming at the wall that surrounded the earthen floor, near the doorway, he heaved to with the cutting edge.The woman cried out behind him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He lunged with the shovel, bearing on it with all his weight.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Disappointingly, it passed through the wall boards.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They had the resistance of a wet cracker.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Washed by the sand, they had seemed quite new from the outside, but it was apparent they had already begun to disintegrate.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"""""I'm stripping this stuff off to make some material for a ladder.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

It was remarkable that such a flabby house could be standing at all.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was bent and warped as if paralyzed on one side.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Maybe such flimsy structures were dynamically possible, since they seemed to be making houses out of plastic and paper these days, but…If that was the way it was with the boards, then he would try the cross-beams.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

He put out his elbow and twisted his body in an effort to ward her off.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But he had miscalculated, and instead of the woman he himself was swung around.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Instantly he tried to counter, but she held on as if chained to the shovel.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He did not understand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At least he could not be defeated by force.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"They rolled over two or three times, threshing about on the earthen floor, and for a brief moment he thought he had pinned her down, but with the handle of the shovel as a shield she deftly flipped him over.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Something was wrong with him; maybe it was the sake"" he had drunk.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Anyway, he no longer cared that his opponent was a woman.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He jabbed his bended knee into her stomach.The woman cried out, and suddenly her strength ebbed.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At once he rolled over on her and held her down.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Her breasts were bare, and his hands slipped on skin that was slippery with sweat.Suddenly the two of them froze, as in a movie when the projector breaks down.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was a petrified moment that would go on and on, if one of them did not do something.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could sense vividly the structure of her breasts outlined against his stomach, and his penis seemed like a living thing completely independent of him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He held his breath.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"With a slight turn of his body the scramble for the shovel would turn into something very different.The woman's gorge rose as she tried to swallow the saliva in her mouth.His penis received this as a signal to stir, but she interrupted in a husky voice.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""City women are all pretty, aren't they?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""City women?""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was suddenly ashamed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

They seemed to have skirted the danger with good grace.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had not realized that soap opera could survive even in the midst of sand.Yet the average woman was firmly convinced, it seemed, that she could not make a man recognize her worth unless every time she opened her legs she did so as if it were a scene in a soap opera.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But this very pathetic and innocent illusion in fact made women the victims of a one-sided, spiritual rape.With his other woman, he had decided he would always use a condom.Even now he was not convinced that he had been completely cured of the venereal disease he had once had.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The results of the tests always came out negative, but after urinating his urethra would suddenly begin to hurt; and when he checked a sample in a test tube, there would be, just as he had feared, something floating around in it, something resembling a piece of waste thread.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The doctor had diagnosed it as a nervous disturbance, but he could not get rid of the suspicion that it was still the same old trouble.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Well, a rubber suits us pretty well, doesn't it?""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

It's a pretty clever expression for her to think up.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But she would never know just how much the expression had hurt him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In the first place, venereal disease was the exact opposite of soap opera.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Venereal disease was the most desperate evidence that soap opera did not exist.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Venereal disease… stealthily imported by Columbus in his tiny ships into tiny harbors… spread so diligently by everyone throughout the world.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
All men were equal before death and venereal disease.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Venereal disease…the collective responsibility of mankind.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

And so his naked—hatless—member was paralyzed and useless.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Her mirror made him impotent.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Her woman's innocence had turned him into an enemy.20His face was as stiff as starch, his breathing like a storm.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His saliva tasted of dry scorched sugar… and such a terrible loss of energy.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At least one glassful of water must have evaporated in perspiration.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

Her sand-streaked face came to about the height of his eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Suddenly she blew her nose with her fingers and rubbed her hands with sand that she scooped up.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Her trousers slipped down over her bending hips.Annoyed, he turned his eyes away.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Yet it was not quite right to say he was only annoyed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A strange feeling, different from dryness, lingered on the tip of his tongue.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His member had been pulsating and vibrant without the rubber, although only for a short time, until he had been put off by the woman's stupid expression.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And now a lingering warmth remained in it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"To call this a discovery would perhaps be exaggerating, but it was worth a moment's attention.He did not feel that he was particularly degenerate.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But he was not at all disposed only to spiritual rape.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was like eating unsweetened tapioca.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Spiritual rape meant that before he could hurt her, he would have to hurt himself.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And why should he contract even a psychological venereal disease?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
That would be adding insult to injury.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Was it true that a woman's glands were so weak that they emitted blood just because a man looked at her?He vaguely sensed that there were two kinds of sexual desire.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"For example, on the basis of the Mobius circle, when you courted a girl, you always began, it seemed, with lectures on nutrition and taste… that is, before you got around to sex.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Food exists only in an abstract sense for anybody dying of hunger; there isn't any such thing as the taste of Kobe beef or Hiroshima oysters.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But once one's belly is full, then one begins to discern differences in taste and textures.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Sexual desire was the same.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"First came desire in general, and only after that did particular sexual tastes evolve.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And sex couldn't be discussed in general; it depended on time and place… sometimes you needed a dose of vitamins… sometimesabowlofeelsandrice.lt was a well-thought-out theory, but regrettably not a single girl friend had offered herself to him in support of it, with a readiness to experience sexual desire in general or sex in particular.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
That was natural.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
No man or woman is wooed by theory alone.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He knew this, but he naively observed the theory of the Mobius circle and kept repeatedly pushing the doorbell of an empty house, only because he did not want to commit spiritual rape.To be sure, he himself wasn't so romantic as to dream of pure sexual relations.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"You could do that when you were looking death in the eye…like the bamboo grass that bears seeds just as it is beginning to wither… like starving mice that repeatedly and frantically copulate as they migrate… like tuberculosis patients who are all seized by a kind of sex madness… like the king or ruler who dwells in a tower and devotes himself to establishing a harem… like the soldier for whom every moment is precious as he awaits the enemy attack and who spends those final moments masturbating…Fortunately, however, man is not indiscriminately exposed to the dangers of death.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Man no longer needs to fear, even in winter; he has been able to free himself of the seasonal sexual urge.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yet when the struggle is over, weapons become an encumbrance.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Order has come about, and the power to control sex and brute force lies within man's grasp, in place of Nature's.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Thus, sexual intercourse is like a commutation ticket: it has to be punched every time you use it.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, you must check to see that the ticket is genuine.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But this checking is terribly onerous; it corresponds precisely to the complications of order.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"All kinds of certificates—contracts, licenses, I.D.cards, permits, certificates of title, authorizations, registrations, carrying permits, certificates of membership, letters of recommendation, notes, leases, temporary permits, agreements, income declarations, receipts, even certificates of ancestry… every conceivable type of paper must be mobilized into action.Thanks to such checks, sex is completely buried under a mantle of certifications… like a basket worm.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It would be all right, I suppose, if this were satisfying.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But even so, would that be the end of certificates?Wouldn't there be something else we had forgotten to declare?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Both men and women are captives of an oppressive jealousy, always suspicious that the other party has purposely left something out To demonstrate their honesty they are compelled to issue a new certificate.No one knows where it will ever stop In the last analysis, the certificate seems to be infinite.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
(She blames me for being too argumentative.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But I'm not the one who's argumentative.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It's just the truth.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
")""But isn't that the obligation of love?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""Not at all.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It's what's left after you have struck out the restrictions by a process of elimination.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If you don't have that much confidence, you might just as well not have any at all.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""There's no obligation to go along with this to the extent—and the poor taste—of gift-wrapping sex.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Let's be freshly pressed every morning in sex too.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In sex, once the coat's been worn, it's already old.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You press out the wrinkles and it's like new again.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Once it's new, it's immediately old again… Is there any obligation to listen to such indecencies?Of course, if he could feel that this regularization offered some guarantee for life, then there was still room for compromise.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But what about reality?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The thorn of death falls from heaven, and its myriad forms leave us no room to move.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In sex, too, one seems to have a vague premonition, a feeling that one has been left with a false promissory note.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And so one begins to falsify the commutation ticket because one is sexually unsatisfied.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Well, that's all right; it's good business.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Or one admits of spiritual rape as a necessary evil.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Anyway, without it there would be almost no marriages.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Those who are in favor of free sex behave in much the same way.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They are only giving a plausible rationalization to mutual rape.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If you accept it as such, it can be enjoyed too.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Freedom combined with constant worry— like a curtain that does not quite close—can only result in sexual psychopaths.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was no opportunity for his pitiable sex to doff its hat and relax.The woman seemed to sense the workings of the man's emotions.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She stopped in the midst of tying the string to her trousers, and the end of the loosened thong hung down from between her hands.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She looked up at him with rabbit-like eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And it was not only because of their red eyelids that they resembled a rabbit's.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The man answered her with eyes in which time had ceased to run.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A strong smell like boiled gristle surrounded her.Still grasping the thong, she slipped by him and went up to her room, where she began to take off her trousers.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Her manner was so completely natural that she seemed to be continuing what she had been doing before.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The man inwardly rubbed his hands in expectation: such a woman was a real woman.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But he immediately reconsidered.Stupid!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
With such hesitancy he would surely botch the thing.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Hastily he too put his hand to his belt.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
If this had been yesterday he would have perhaps assumed her behavior to be a woman's transparent play-acting… like her giggles and dimples.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Actually that might be the case.But he did not want to think so.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The stage at which he could bargain for her body had long passed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Now, force had decided the situation.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was ample basis for thinking that relations would be mutually agreeable, and bargaining for permission could be dismissed.A little flow of sand, along with his trousers, slid over the base of his member and fell along his thighs.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A stench like that of musty socles rose up.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Slowly, but surely, with a pumping like that of a water pipe in which the water has been turned off, his member began to fill again.Hatless, his penis indicating the direction, he spread his wings and melted in behind the already naked woman.Would he find it enjoyable?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course everything fitted, as if into a square of equally spaced graph paper: breathing, time, the room, the woman.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Was this what the Mobius man called general sexual desire?Maybe, but what tight buttocks!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"You couldn't compare them to the frustrated bags of bones you picked up in the streets.The woman, sitting on one knee, had begun to brush the sand from her neck with a towel which she had rolled into a ball.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Suddenly there was an avalanche of sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The whole house trembled and groaned.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A provoking interference!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Before his very eyes, a mistlike sand covered the woman's head with white, collecting on her shoulders and arms.The two, clutched in each other's arms, could only wait for the avalanche to pass.Their sweat trickled onto the sand which had gathered, and on that still more sand fell.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The woman's shoulders trembled.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He felt like superheated water, as if he were on the verge of boiling over.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Yet he could not understand why he was so terribly attracted by her thighs.But he was… so much that he felt like taking the nerves of his body and coiling them one by one around them.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The appetite of meat-eating animals must be just this—coarse, voracious.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He fought back like a coiled spring.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"This was an experience he had not had with the other.On that bed—with the other one—they had been a feeling man and woman, a watching man and woman; they had been a man who watched himself experiencing and a woman who watched herself experiencing; they had been a woman who watched a man watching himself and a man watching a woman watching herself… all reflected in counter-mirrors… the limitless consciousness of the sexual act.Sexual desire, with a history of some hundred million years from the amoeba on up, is fortunately not easily worn out.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But what he needed now was a voracious passion, a stimulation that would sweep his nerves into the woman's loins.The sand avalanche stopped, and as though he had been waiting for it to do so, he joined the woman in helping to brush the sand from her body.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She laughed in a husky voice.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His hands became more and more insistent as they passed from her breasts under her arms and from there around her loins.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Her fingers dug into his neck, and now and then she would give little cries of surprise.When he had finished, it was her turn to brush his body.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He closed his eyes and waited, passing his hand over her hair, which was hard and rough to the touch.There was a spasmodic contraction, and again the same thing… the same changeless repetition to which he had devoted himself, dreaming of other things: eating, walking, sleeping, hiccoughing, bawling, copulating.21MAN'S convulsions go on building endless layers of fossils.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Dinosaur teeth and glaciers were powerless against this reproductive drive with its screams and its ecstasy.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Finally a white flash squeezed his writhing body dry… a meteoric swarm spurted out, piercing the limitless darkness… rusty, orange-colored stars… an alkaline chorus.The glimmer trailed on and disappeared at last.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The woman's hands patting him on the buttocks to urge him on no longer had any effect.His nerves, which had streamed into her, had withered back like a frost-bitten radish, and his member was paralyzed between the lips of the conch.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The woman, who had thrust out her hips, reluctant to let him go, also sank back exhausted in a breathless contentment.An old rag rankly sour behind a chest of drawers… an avenue in front of a bicycle track, from which he used to return covered with the dust of regret.In the final analysis, nothing had been of any avail, nothing had been finished.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was not he who had satisfied his desires, but apparently someone quite different, someone who had borrowed his body.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Sex, of its nature, was not defined by a single, individual body but by the species.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"An individual, finished with his squalid act, must return at once to his former self.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Only the happy ones return to contentment Those who were sad return to despair.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Those who were dying return to their deathbeds.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
How could he possibly be convinced that such trickery was passionate love?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Was there anything better in this passionate love than in commutation sex?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If there were, it would be better to be some ascetic made of glass.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Apparently he had dozed off for a moment, rolling over in the sweat and secretions which smelled like rancid fish oil.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had dreamed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was a dream about a lavatory which he could never find although he could hear the sound of water, about a common bathroom where the toilet was filled to overflowing with feces, about a long gallery whose flooring was beginning to warp, about a cracked glass.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was a man, running with a canteen.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he asked him for just a swallow of water, the man scowled at him, making a face like a grasshopper, and rushed off.He awoke.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A hot, sticky glue was melting on the back of his tongue.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His thirst had returned twofold.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He wanted water.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Sparkling, crystalline water, with silver spurs of air bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was an empty water pipe in a deserted house, covered with spider webs and smeared with dust, gasping like a fish.When he stood up, his hands and feet felt like heavy rubber bags of water.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He picked up the empty kettle, which had been thrown on the earthen floor, and tipped it to his mouth.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"After more than thirty seconds, two, three drops finally dampened the end of his tongue.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But it remained as dry as blotting paper.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His expectant throat convulsed even more, as if it had gone insane.Frantic for water, he rummaged around in the vicinity of the sink for anything he could get his hands on.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Of all chemical compounds water was the simplest one.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It should not be impossible to find some somewhere… like a penny forgotten in a desk drawer.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He smelled water.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Without a doubt it was the smell of water.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He hastily scraped some wet sand from the bottom of the water jar and stuffed his mouth full.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A feeling of nausea welled up in him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He bent over, his stomach convulsed, and his tears began to flow as he vomited up a yellow gastric liquid.The pain of his headache slipped down over his eyes like a leaden visor.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Apparently passion was simply a short-cut to collapse.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Suddenly he rose to his hands and knees, and like a dog began to dig in the sand of the earthen floor.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he had dug to the depth of his elbows, the sand was dark and moist.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He thrust his face into it, pressed his burning forehead against it, inhaling it deeply.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The oxygen and hydrogen might conceivably combine.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"Distressed, the man hastily went back through his memories of the village.He remembered the horizon of sand and sky.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was no place for a fire tower to be.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Moreover, he could not believe that he and the woman could be seen from the outside while they could see no one from where they were.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""You'll understand if you'll take a look by the edge of the cliff out back.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""He meekly bent down and picked up the shovel.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
To worry about his self-respect after all that happened would be like ironing a grimy shirt.He went out as if driven.The sand was burning like an empty pot over a fire.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The glare took his breath away.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The air that filled his nostrils smelled of soap.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But with each step he was getting that much closer to water.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he stood under the cliff on the sea side and looked up, he could make out the top of a black tower about the size of the tip of his little finger.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The thornlike projection was doubtless a lookout.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Had he already been noticed?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The lookout had doubtless been waiting gloatingly for this moment.He turned toward the black thom and, holding the shovel over his head, waved it furiously baclc and forth.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He adjusted the angle of the blade so that it would reflect into the eyes of the watcher.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A film of burning quicksilver spread over his eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Whatever was the woman doing?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She had better come and help right away.Suddenly a cool shadow fell over him like a damp handkerchief: a cloud had crossed above, like some fallen leaf driven before the wind into a corner of the sky.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Damn it… if it would only rain he would not have to do this.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He would hold out his two hands and they would be filled with water.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Streams of water on the windowpanes… pillars of water bursting from the eaves troughs… splashing rain veiling the asphalt.He did not know whether he was dreaming or whether his musings had become real, but suddenly he was aware of a commotion around him.Coming to himself, he found that he was in the midst of a sand slide.He took shelter under the eaves of the house and leaned against the wall.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His bones seemed to have melted like those of some canned fish.His thirst burst around his temples, leaving fragments lying scattered on the surface of his consciousness like dots standing out in relief.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He gritted his teeth and held his hands over his stomach; at last he contained his rising nausea.The sound of the woman's voice came to him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She was facing the cliff and hailing someone.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He looked up, squinting between his heavy eyelids.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The old man who had first brought him here was just letting down a bucket, suspended at the end of a rope.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Water!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At last it had come!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The bucket tipped and made a splotch on the sandy slope.It was water, unmistakably the real thing!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"With a shout he fairly flew through the air to get to it.When he came within reach of the bucket he pushed the woman aside, trampling her with his feet, and took hold of it with both hands.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could hardly take off the rope before he impatiently thrust his face into the bucket, his body heaving like a pump.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He raised his face and took abreath.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

At once the man jumped up and grabbed it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"He tried to get up, but a terrible weight forced him back on the mattress.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Remembering, he snatched the towel from his face.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"From the open doorway a wan, cool moonlight was streaming in, as if through gelatin.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Suddenly it was night again.The kettle, lamp, and bottle of cheap sak6 stood beside his pillow.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He raised himself at once on one elbow and rinsed out his mouth, spitting the water into the sunken fireplace.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Slowly, relishing the feeling, he moistened his throat.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He felt around the lamp, and his hand touched a soft package and some cigarettes and matches.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He lit the lamp and put a match to a cigarette; then cautiously he tried a mouthful of cheap sake"".",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His scattered faculties slowly began to arrange themselves.The contents of the package consisted of a boxed lunch: three balls of rice mixed with wheat, which were still warm; two skewers of dried sardines; some dry, wrinkled radish pickle; and some boiled vegetable that had a bitter taste.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The vegetable seemed to be dried radish leaves.He could eat only one of the skewers of sardines and one rice ball.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His stomach felt like a cold rubber glove.When he stood up, his joints creaked like the wind howling over the zinc roof.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Nervously he peered into the water jar.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It had been replenished and was brimming full.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He dampened the towel and wiped his face.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A shiver went through his whole body like a flourescent light.He washed his neck and flanks and shook the sand from between his fingers.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Maybe he should be satisfied with creature comforts and let the rest go.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Shall I fix you some tea?""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The woman was standing in the doorway.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""No, thanks.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
My stomach is too queasy as it is.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""Did you sleep well?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""You should have got me up when you got up.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The woman bent her head giggling.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Actually, I got up three times during the night and fixed the towel over your face.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""She had the coquetry of a three-year-old who has just learned to use an adult's laugh.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was obvious she did not know how best to express her cheerful feelings or her embarrassment.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He felt depressed and turned his eyes away.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Shall I help you with the digging?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Or would it be better if I did the carrying?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""Well… It's about time for the next basket lift to come.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""When he actually began working, for some reason he did not resist it as much as he thought he would.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What could be the cause of this change?he wondered.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Was it the fear that the water would be discontinued?Was it because of his indebtedness to the woman, or something about the character of the work itself?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Work seemed something fundamental for man, something which enabled him to endure the aimless flight of time.Once he had been taken along—when was it?—by the Mobius man to a lecture-meeting.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The meeting place was completely surrounded by a low, rusty fence, and within the enclosure the surface of the ground was almost invisible beneath paper refuse, empty boxes, and rags of indiscriminate origin.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What had ever put it into the designer's head to place such a fence around the site?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Whereupon, as though his thoughts had materialized, a man in a tired suit of clothes appeared, leaning over the iron fence, earnestly trying to scrape it with his fingertips.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His Mobius friend had informed him that it was a plain-clothes man.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Then on the ceiling of the meeting place there was a huge coffee-colored leaky spot the like of which he had never seen before.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In the midst of all this, the lecturer was speaking: ""The only way to go beyond work is through work.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It is not that work itself is valuable; we surmount work by work.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The real value of work lies in the strength of self-denial.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""He heard the sharp signal of someone whistling through his fingers.Then there were carefree shouts and people running up, dragging the baskets.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As usual, as they drew nearer they became quiet, and the basket was lowered in silence.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could feel that he was under close observation, but it would be of no use now to yell at the cliff.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When the specified amount of sand had been safely hoisted the tension relaxed, and even the feel of the air seemed to change.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No one said anything, but it seemed that for the moment they had come to an agreement.He could see a very definite change in the woman's attitude too.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Let's have a break.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I'll bring some tea.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Her voice and her behavior too were more cheerful.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She was brimming over with an unobtainable zest.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The man felt sated, as if he had eaten too much sugar.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
As she passed him he brought himself to pat her buttocks from behind.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
If the voltage is too high the filament bums out.Never had he intended to deceive her like this.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Sometime he would tell her the story of the guard who protected the imaginary castle.There was a castle.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
No.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It wasn't necessarily a castle, it could be anything: a factory, a bank, a gambling house.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
So the guard could be either a watchman or a bodyguard.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Now the guard, always prepared for the enemy attack, never failed in his vigilance.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
One day the long-expected enemy finally came.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"This was the moment, and he rang the alarm signal.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Strangely enough, however, there was no response from the troops.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Needless to say, the enemy easily overpowered the guard in one fell swoop.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In his fading consciousness he saw the enemy sweeping like the wind through the gates, over the walls, and into the buildings unhindered by anyone.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No, it was the castle, not the enemy, that was really like the wind.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The single guard, like a withered tree in the wilderness, had stood guarding an illusion.He sat down on the shovel and lit a cigarette.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The flame caught at last with the third match.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His fatigue spread out into a sluggish circle, like India ink dropped in water—it was a jellyfish, a scent bag, a diagram of an atomic nucleus.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Some night bird had found a field mouse and was calling to its mate with a weird cry.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
An uneasy dog bayed deeply.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"High in the night sky there was a continuous, discordant sound of wind blowing at a different velocity.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And on the ground the wind was a knife continually shaving off thin layers of sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He wiped away the perspiration, blew his nose with his fingers, and brushed the sand from his head.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The ripples of sand at his feet suddenly looked like the motionless crests of waves.Supposing they were sound waves, what kind of music would they give?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
he wondered.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Maybe even a human being could sing such a song… if tongs were driven into his nose and slimy blood stopped up his ears… if his teeth were broken one by one with hammer blows, and splinters jammed into his urethra… if a vulva were cut away and sewn onto his eyelids.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It might resemble cruelty, and then again it might be a little different Suddenly his eyes soared upward like a bird, and he felt as if he were looking down on himself.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Certainly he must be the strangest of all… he who was musing on the strangeness of things here.23Got a one-way ticket to the blues, woo, woo, .",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
".IF you want to sing it, sing it.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
These days people caught in the clutches of the one-way ticket never sing it like that.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The soles of those who have only a one-way ticket are so thin that they scream when they step on a pebble.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They have had their fill of walking.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The Round-Trip Ticket Blues"" is what they want to sing.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A one-way ticket is a disjointed life that misses the links between yesterday and today, today and tomorrow.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Only the man who obstinately hangs on to a round-trip ticket can hum with real sorrow a song of a one-way ticket.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"For this very reason he grows desperate lest the return half of his ticket be lost or stolen; he buys stocks, signs up for life insurance, and talks out of different sides of his mouth to his union pals and his superiors.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He hums ""The One-Way Ticket Blues"" with all his might and, choosing a channel at random, turns the television up to full volume in an attempt to drown out the peevish voices of those who have only a one-way ticket and who keep asking for help, voices that come up through the bathtub drain or the toilet hole.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It would not be strange at all if ""The Round-Trip Ticket Blues"" were the song of mankind imprisoned.Whenever he could, he stealthily worked at making a rope.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He tore his extra shirt into pieces, twisted them together, and then joined them to the kimono sash of the woman's dead husband; altogether his rope was now about five yards long.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When the time came, he would fasten one end to a pair of rusty shears, which he would prop half open with a piece of wood.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, the rope was still not long enough.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could almost make the required length if he tied on the hemp clothesline and the rough straw rope, stretched over the earthen floor, on which she had hung some fish and corn to dry.The idea had come to him rather suddenly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But it was not necessarily true that only a time-tested plan would be successful.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Such sudden inspiration had sufficient basis in itself, even though the process of its emergence had been unconscious.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The chances of success were better in spontaneous cases than with plans that had been fussed over.Now the question was: When should he put his plan into action?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He concluded that the best time for escape would be during the day, while the woman was asleep.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But it would be risky to cross through the village unless it was dark.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He would begin his actions systematically, leaving the place as long a time as possible before the woman awoke, hiding out in some convenient place, and waiting there until the sun had set.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He would take advantage of the darkness before the moon rose, and it probably would not be too difficult to get out to a main highway where buses ran.In the meantime, he would use all his skill to get the woman to tell him about the topography and organization of the village.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"What were the economics of a place like this, which did not have a single fishing boat although it faced the sea?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
How long had it been in this condition?What was the population?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Who cultivated the tulips, and where?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What did the children do?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Did they go to a school?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he were to gather together his vague memories of that first day when he had arrived, he could make an approximate map, even though it would be based on indirect information.Ideally nothing could be better than to escape by de-touring around the village and not going through it at all, but the west wall was obstructed by a rather steep promontory which, although not very high, seemed to have become a sheer cliff, having been eroded away since early times by the waves.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even though there were footholds which the villagers used when they went to gather firewood, they were obstructed by thickets and hard to locate; and then it would be unfortunate to arouse the woman's suspicions by being over-inquisitive.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"On the opposite side, to the east, lay a very narrow creek, which was completely surrounded by uninhabited sand dunes rising and falling for more than five miles and which led ultimately right back again to the entrance of the village.In other words, the village was a bag of sand, cut off at the neck by the creek and the sheer cliffs.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The margin of safety would seem to be greater if he attacked the center rather than spending precious minutes detouring, thus giving the villagers more time to rally themselves and catch him.But that did not mean that the problem was solved.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"For example, there was the lookout in the fire tower.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was also worried that the woman, upon noticing his disappearance, might set up a hue and cry and that the village gates would be closed before he could get out.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps he could condense the two problems into one.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The first basket gang usually came with the water and the regular deliveries a good while after the sun had set.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If the woman tried to report his disappearance before then, she could certainly get through only to the fire lookout.The question came down to just what he should do about the fire guard.Fortunately, owing to the sudden fluctuation of temperature in the region, the surface of the land was shrouded in mist for thirty minutes to an hour before sunset.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The reason was apparently that the silicic acid in the sand, which had little capacity to retain heat, suddenly released the warmth it had absorbed during the day.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"From the fire lookout, the whole area lay precisely at the angle of light reflection, and even with a slight mist a thick, milk-white curtain completely obstructed the view.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had made certain of this yesterday, just to be on the safe side.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At the foot of the cliff toward the sea, he had tried sending a signal by waving his towel a number of times, but, just as he had anticipated, there had been no response.It was on the fourth day after he had conceived it that the plan was actually carried out.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had decided on Saturday evening, which was the usual time the bath water was delivered.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The preceding night he had determined to get a full night's sleep by pretending to have a cold.For precaution's sake, he had insisted that they fetch him some aspirin.The tablets were discolored, apparently shop-worn from their sojourn in the local emporium.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He took two along with some of the cheap sak6; the results were immediate.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Until the woman returned from her work, he had heard nothing except the sounds of the lift basket being raised and lowered.The woman, who had not had to work by herself for some time, understandably bore signs of great fatigue.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As she busied herself with the preparation of the meal, he charted idly about all sorts of things…the sink, which had been in bad condition for a long time, should be repaired… and so on.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could see that she was thinking that his selfishness was a sign that he was putting down roots here, and she dared not register irritation lest she destroy his mood.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Now, after work, anyone should feel like taking a bath.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The sand that clung to the skin with the night's perspiration was especially annoying.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Not only was it the day for the delivery of the bath water, but the woman especially liked to wash him and would surely not put up any objection.As he was being soaped he pretended to be aroused and pulled at her kimono.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He would wash her in return.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Caught between confusion and expectancy, she made a gesture of resistance, but it was not clear just what she was resisting.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He quickly poured a bucket of warm water over her naked body and without a washcloth began to pass his soapy hands directly over her skin.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He started with the earlobes and shifted down to the jaw, and as he passed over her shoulders he reached around and with one hand grasped her breast.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She cried out and, sliding down his chest, crouched level with his stomach.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Undoubtedly it was a posture of expectation.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But the man was in no hurry.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"With measured cadence, his hands went on with their painstaking massaging from one part of her body to another.The woman's excitement naturally infected him too.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He felt a strange sadness that was different from usual.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The woman was glowing from within now, as if she were being washed by a wave of fireflies.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
To disappoint her now would be like suddenly shooting a freed criminal from behind.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And so he reacted with even greater frenzy, spurring on his awakening senses.But there is a limit to perverted passion too.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The woman, who had been entreating him at first, manifested obvious fright at this frenzy.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was seized by a feeling of prostration, as if he had ejaculated.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Again he spurred his courage, forcing himself on by a series of helter-skelter lewd fantasies, arousing his passion by biting her breasts and striking her body, which, with the soap, sweat, and sand, felt like machine oil mixed with iron filings.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had intended to let this go on for at least two hours.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But finally the woman gritted her teeth and, complaining of pain, crouched away from him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He mounted her from behind like a rabbit and finished up within seconds.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Then he threw water over her to wash off the soap; he forced her to drink a teacupful of the cheap sake' along with three aspirin tablets.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She would sleep straight on through without awakening until night… and, if things went well, until she was awakened by the cries from the basket gangs.In her sleep the woman breathed as if a paper wad had been stuck in her nose.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Her respirations were deep and long; he tapped her heel lightly with his foot, but she showed almost no change.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She was an old tube squeezed dry of all sex.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He fixed the towel, which had almost slipped off her face, and pulled her kimono down around her knees, seeing that it had twisted like a rope around her waist.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Fortunately he was completely occupied with the final arrangements of his plan and there was no time for sentimentality.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he had finished working on the device he had contrived with the old shears, it was just about the appointed moment.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As he had expected, he felt a kind of lacerating pain as he looked at her for the last time.A thin light played in a circle about a yard from the upper lip of the hole.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It must be between six-thirty and twenty of seven.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The time wasjust right.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He forced both arms back with all his strength and turned his neck to and fro, stretching the kinks out of his shoulder muscles.First he had to climb to the top of the roof.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In grappling, the chances of success are greater the closer the angle of elevation is to forty-five degrees.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He would have liked to climb up on the roof using the rope, but he was afraid the woman might be awakened by the sound of the shears striking the shingles.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He decided to eliminate the testing and to circle around back of the house and climb up on the roof using as footholds the vestiges of a rain shelter that seemed once to have been used as a place for drying clothes.The squared timbers were thin and half rotten, and they worried him.But what came next was even worse.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The flying sand had polished the straight white grain of the roof, making it appear like new.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But when he climbed up on it, it was as soft as a soaked cracker.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he were to put his foot through it, he would be in realtrouble.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He dispersed his weight,crawling slowly forward.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Finally hereached the ridgepole and, straddlingit, raised himself on his knees.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The topof the roof was already in theshadows, and the faint honey-coloredgranulations on the west edge of thehole were signs that the mist wasgradually beginning to come in.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He no longer need concern himself with the lookout in the tower.He tied the rope into a lasso and, holding it in his right hand about a yard below the shears, swung it in a circle around his head.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His target was one of the sandbags that were used instead of a pulley when they raised and lowered the baskets.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Since the bags could hold the rope ladder, they must surely be quite firmly buried.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Gradually he increased the speed of the revolutions and, taking aim, let fly with the loop.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It sailed off in a completely unexpected direction.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His idea of casting was wrong.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The shears had to fly in a tangent to the circumference of the hole, and so he would have to let go at the very instant the rope was at right angles with the target, or maybe a bare instant before.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yes, that was it!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But the next time the shears unfortunately struck the middle of the cliff and fell to the ground.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It would seem that the speed of the revolutions and the angle of elevation as he held the rope were not right.After repeated tries, he managed to establish both the distance and the angle pretty well.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But still there was a long way to go before a real strike.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He would have been happy at any sign of progress, but still there was no evidence that the margin of error was lessening—indeed, to the contrary, his aim was becoming terribly erratic with fatigue and impatience.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps he had oversimplified.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He felt unreasonably angry and close to tears, as though someone had actually deceived him.Yet there seemed to be some truth in the law of probability, according to which the chance of success is directly proportionate to the number of repetitions.'",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"With something like the thirtieth try, when in despair he had given up hope, the rope flew straight over the bags.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The inside of his mouth felt prickly, and even though he kept swallowing, the saliva kept welling up.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But it was still too soon to be pleased with himself.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had simply got hold of money with which to buy a lottery ticket.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He would see now whether he would win or lose.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"All his nerves strained toward the rope as he drew it gently toward him, as if he were pulling on stars with a strand of spider's web.It resisted.At first he could not believe it, but the rope actually did not move.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He tried exerting more pressure.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His body was poised, waiting for the moment of disillusion… was it to be now?… or now?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But there was no longer any room for doubt.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The hook improvised from the shears had bitten firmly into the bags.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What luck!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What unbelievable luck!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"From this minute on, things would really go in his favor.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"With a giddy heart, he got down from the roof and walked to where the end of the rope, now hanging perpendicular, was gently shaving away at the sand cliff.Ground level was right there… so near he could scarcely believe it.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His face was stiff and his lips trembled.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Columbus's egg must have been hard-boiled.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Keep it hot too long, though, and it would spoil.He grasped the rope and slowly began hoisting himself.Suddenly it began to stretch as if it were rubber.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was startled, and the perspiration gushed from his pores.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Fortunately the stretching stopped after about a foot.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He tried bringing all his weight to bear, and this time there seemed to be no further cause for worry.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He spit on his hands, fitted the rope between his legs, and began to climb hand over hand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He rose like a toy monkey climbing a toy coconut tree.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Perhaps it was his excitement, but the perspiration on his forehead felt strangely cold.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In an effort to keep the sand from falling on him, he avoided brushing against it and depended solely on the rope.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But he felt uneasy as his body turned round and round in the air.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The dead weight of his torso was more than he had anticipated, and his progress was slow.And whatever was this trembling?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His arms had begun to jerk in spite of him, and he felt almost as if he were snapping himself like a whip.Perhaps it was a natural reaction, in view of those forty-six horrible days.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he had climbed a yard the hole seemed a hundred yards deep… two yards, two hundred yards deep.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Gradually, as the depth of the hole increased, he began to be dizzy.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was too tired.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He mustn't look down!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But there!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was the surface!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The surface where, no matter which way he went, he would walk to freedom… to the very ends of the earth.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he got to the surface, this endless moment would become a small flower pressed between the pages of his diary…poisonous herb or carnivorous plant, it would be no more than a bit of half-transparent colored paper, and as he sipped his tea in the parlor he would hold it up to the light and take pleasure in telling its story.And now, he hadn't the slightest intention of accusing the woman any more.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He could definitely guarantee that if she wasn't exactly a lady she was also not a prostitute.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
If she needed any backing later he would gladly guarantee it… as much as she wanted.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She was a stupid creature whose only merit was that she clung to her round-trip ticket… like him.But even with the same round-trip ticket, if the point of departure was different, the destination was naturally different too.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It would not be particularly strange, in fact, if his return ticket were to be her ticket out.Even suppose, for the time being, that she had made a mistake… after all, a mistake was a mistake.Don't look down.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He mustn't look down!A mountain climber, a window cleaner on some skyscraper, an electrician atop a television tower, a trapeze artist in a circus, a chimney sweep on a factory smokestack—the instant of his destruction was the instant he looked down.24HE had made it!His fingernails struck the sandbags and, not caring if his hands were stripped of their skin, he frantically scrambled up.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was on top!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He no longer had to worry about slipping back even if he relaxed his grip.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yet it was impossible for him to straighten his arms and for minutes he remained as he was, clutching the bags tightly to him.On this day of his liberation, the forty-sixth he had been in the pit, a violent wind was raging.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As he began to crawl along, his face and neck were struck by stinging grains of sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had not counted on such a savage wind.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In the hole he had just felt that the sound of the sea was closer than usual, and right now should be the moment of the evening calm.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yet if it was blowing this much, surely he could not hope for any mist.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Maybe the sky had looked muddy only from within the hole.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He might well have mistaken the wind-blown sand for mist Whichever way it was, the situation was delicate.He looked up nervously.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
In the fading light the fire tower seemed to be leaning unsteadily to one side.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was surprisingly slight and far away.But as the man in it would be watching him through binoculars, he couldn't count on the distance to be in his favor.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He wondered if they had already spotted him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No, if they had, they would have instantly rung the alarm bell.On a stormy night almost a half year ago, the woman had told him, a bulwark had given way in a hole located on the western outskirts of the village, and the house in it had been half buried.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And then it had rained.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The water-soaked sand had doubled in weight and crushed the house like a matchbox.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Fortunately no one was injured, but the next morning the whole family had tried to run away.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In less than five minutes after the alarm was sounded, they could hear the wailing of the old woman being led along the road in back.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The family seemed to have had hereditary mental trouble, the woman had added in a convinced tone.No he could not waste any time.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He raised his head resolutely and looked around.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Long shadows fell along the hollows and rises of the dunes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The landscape was bathed in a murky reddishness, and the wisps of wind-blown sand streaming out from the shadows were swallowed up one after the other by other shadows.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Could he escape detection behind his screen of blowing sand?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Looking back over his shoulder to check on the effect of the light reflection, he stared in amazement.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The wind-blown sand was not alone responsible for the pall of milky smoke that lay over the landscape, shading the sinking sun with crayon strokes of color.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
All at once a shredded and shifting mist was steadily rising from the surface of the ground.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If it was blown away in one place, it rose in another; swept clear here, it billowed up there.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"From his experience in the hole, he was well aware that the sand attracted moisture, but he had had no idea that there was this much.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It looked like the scene of a fire after the firemen have gone.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, it was a thin mist, not very conspicuous in the reflected light, but a good camouflage, enough to conceal him from the eyes of the lookout.He put on his shoes, which he had thrust into his belt, and stuck the coiled rope into his pocket.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"With the shears attached, it would be a useful weapon in an emergency.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The direction of his flight was toward the west, which was shielded by the refracted light.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His first need was to find a place to hide until the sun went down.Well, let's get going.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Keep your back down and run along where it's low.Don't lose your head now.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Keep your eyes peeled and get a move on.There!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There's a hollow to hide in over there!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What was that suspicious noise?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
An unlucky sign?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Maybe not… up, and get going.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Not too much io the right.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The cliff on the right was so low that he might be seen.A path had been worn in a straight line from one hole to another by the night basket crews.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The right side of the path was a smooth slope with a number of indentations.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The rooftops of a second row of houses were barely visible.They in turn were protected by the line ofhouses to the sea side.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The walls of theholes all along there were low, and thebrushwood fence built as protection againstthe sand seemed to be still of some avail.From the village side of the wall they could apparently go in and out as they pleased.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
When he raised his head a little he could see all the way to the center of the town.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Roofs of tile, zinc, and thatch clustered in black splotches in the center of the undulating terrain, which opened out like a fan before him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was a straggling grove of pine, and he could see something that looked like a pond.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And just to protect this pitiful bit of geography, more than ten households on the sea side had to submit to a life of slavery.The slave holes were now situated in a line on the left of the road.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Here and there were branching paths made by the basket crews, and beyond, threadbare sandbags buried in the sand told where the holes were.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It pained him just to look at them.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In some places no rope ladders were looped around the bags, but more places had them than not.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Not a few of the slaves, he supposed, and already lost all will to escape.He could easily understand how it was possible to live such a life.There were kitchens, there were stoves with fires burning in them, there were apple crates, in place of desks, piled full of books, there were kitchens, there were sunken hearths, there were lamps, there were stoves with fires burning in them, there were torn shoji, there were sooty ceilings, there were kitchens, there were clocks that were running and clocks that weren't, there were blaring radios and broken radios, there were kitchens and stoves with fires in them… And in the midst of them all were scattered hundred-yen pieces, domestic animals, children, sex, promissory notes, adultery, incense burners, souvenir photos, and… It goes on, terrifyingly repetitive.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"One could not do without repetition in life, like the beating of the heart, but it was also true that the beating of the heart was not all there was to life.Down, quick!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No, it was nothing, just a crow.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was, alas, no chance of catching it and stuffing it, but such things no longer made any difference.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The craving for decorations, medals, tattoos, came only when one dreamed unbelievable dreams.At last he seemed to be coming to the outskirts of the village, and the road lay atop the ridge of sand dunes; the view opened out, and to his left he could see the sea.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The wind carried the pungent taste of surf, and his ears and nostrils hummed like a spinning top.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The towel he had tied around his neck snapped in the wind and struck his cheek; as he had expected, the mist here seemed to lack the strength to rise.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The leaden sea was overlaid with an aluminum sheet, gathered into wrinkles like the skin on boiled milk.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The sun, squeezed by clouds that resembled frogs' eggs, seemed to be stalling, unwilling to sink.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The horizon was dotted with the motionless silhouettes of black ships, whose size and distance from him he was unable to guess.Beyond were only the smooth sand dunes, undulating in countless ridges that stretched on to the promontory.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Maybe it was dangerous to go on like this.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Worried, he turned and looked behind him; fortunately, the fire tower was cut off from view by a slight rise in the sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As he raised himself on his toes little by little, his eye was caught by a lowlying shack half buried in the slope immediately to his right.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Because of the angle, it had not been visible in the shadows.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
To the leeward was a deep hollow that looked as if it had been scooped out with a spoon.An ideal place to hide.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The texture of the sand was as smooth as the underside of a shell, and there was not a sign of anyone's having been there.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But what was he to do about his own footprints?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He retraced his steps and found that beyond about thirty yeards they were already completely effaced.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even where he was standing they were caving in, transforming before his very eyes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The wind was good for something.As he was about to go round to the back of the shack, something dark came slinking out from the inside.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was a reddish dog, thick-set like a pig.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He must not frighten it Go on, get away!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But the dog showed no sign of retreating and stood rooted, its eyes fixed on him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"One ear was torn, and its small unbecoming eyes made it seem all the more shifty.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It sniffed at him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Would it take it into its head to bark?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
he wondered.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Just let it try.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He gripped the shears in his pocket.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Let it make a sound and he would put a hole in its brains with these!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The dog stared back at him defiantly, but in silence, not even growling.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Was it a wild dog?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It had a seedy, lusterless coat, and its muzzle was covered with scabs.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They say it's a dangerous dog that doesn't bark.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Damn!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He should have brought some food.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And speaking of food, he had forgotten to bring along his potassium cyanide.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Oh well, let it go.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The woman would probably never find where he had hidden it anyway.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He held out his hand and gave a low whistle to see if he could get the dog's attention.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"For an answer, the dog curled its thin lips, which were the color of smoked herring, and bared its yellow sand-incrusted fangs.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The brute certainly couldn't have much appetite for him, he mused.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It had a beastly large throat, though.He had better manage to get him on the first try, but…Abruptly the dog looked away, his scruff went down, and he ambled lazily off as if nothing had happened.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It had apparently given in to his unbending will.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His mental power was not in bad shape if he could stare a wild dog down.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He let himself slide into the hollow and lay as he was, against the slope.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was screened from the wind, and he gave a sigh of relief and contentment.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The dog, staggering under the gusts, disappeared beyond the blowing sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The fact that a wild dog had made the place its home was a guarantee that people did not come around.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As long as the dog did not go tale-bearing to the office of the farm co-op, his safety here seemed assured.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In spite of the sweat that began slowly and steadily to ooze out, he felt well.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
How quiet!… Quite as if he were enveloped in gelatin.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Although he was clutching a time bomb, set for moment X, it bothered him no more than the sound of the balance wheel of his alarm clock.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His Mobius friend would have immediately analyzed the situation, so:—My friend, what you're doing is consoling yourself with the means of your escape and not keeping your eye on the goal.And he would have agreed easily:—Very true.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But I wonder if you have to distinguish so precisely between means and end.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Wouldn't it be all right to use the definitions as need dictates?—No, no, that wouldn't do at all.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You can't spend time vertically.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It's an accepted fact that time really goes horizontally.—What happens if you try spending it vertically?—You're a mummy if you do!He chuckled and took off his shoes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Indeed, time did seem to run horizontally.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He could not stand the sand and sweat that had collected between his toes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He took off his shoes and socks and stretched his toes, letting the air in between them.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Hmm, why did places where animals live have such an unpleasant smell?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Wouldn't it be fine if there were animals that smelled like flowers!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
No.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was the smell of his own feet.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A curious feeling of friendliness welled up in him when he realized this.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He recalled that someone had said that there was nothing that tasted so good as one's own ear wax, that it was better than real cheese.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even if it weren't that bad, there were all kinds of fascinating things one never tired of smelling… like the stink of a decaying tooth.The entrance to the house was more than half blocked with sand, and it was almost impossible to see in.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Was it the remains of an old well?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It would not be so strange if a shack had been built over a well to protect it from the sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, you could hardly expect to find water in a place like this… He tried to look in, and this time he was enveloped by the real smell of dog.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Animal smell is beyond philosophy.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He remembered a socialist saying that he liked a Korean's soul but he couldn't stand his smell.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Well then, if time did run horizontally, it had better show him how fast it could run… Hope and uneasiness… a feeling of release and impatience.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He found it most unbearable to be tantalized this way.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He put the towel over his face and lay down on his back.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It might be his own smell, but he was not about to pay it compliments.Something was crawling fitfully up the instep of his foot.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Its manner of walking could hardly be like that if it belonged to the beetle family.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He decided it must be some kind of ground bug, for it drew itself along with difficulty on its six weak legs.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He didn't even feel like finding out.Supposing for the time being it did belong to the beetle family; even, so he still hesitated, wondering whether he really felt like going after it or not.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was apparently incapable of a definite decision.A breeze flipped the towel from his face.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Out of the corner of his eye he could see a ridge of dunes glistening and golden.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A smoothly rising curve cut off the line of gold and abruptly slipped away into the shadows.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was something strangely tense in the spatial composition, and he shuddered with an uncanny loneliness for people.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"(Yes, this certainly is a romantic landscape… A setting like this would be a great attraction for young tourists these days.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Precious, gilt-edged stock it is… I can guarantee its future development as someone who's experienced in this profession.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But if you're going to develop it, first you've got to advertise!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Even flies won't come if you don't advertise.The place might just as well not be here if no one knows about it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It's like having a precious stone and not finding a practical use for it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Well then, what shall we do?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I'll put the thing in the hands of a first-rate photographer and have him make me up some good-looking picture postcards.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
In the old days you used to find a beauty spot and then have your postcards made.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But now, it's common sense to have the cards made first… and afterwards think up a beautiful place.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"I have brought along two or three samples, if you'd care to look them over.)",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The poor postcard salesman had come with the intention of taking the villagers in, but he had been the one to be taken in, and in the end he had got sick and died.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But then, he certainly could not imagine that the card man had been particularly eloquent.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had probably been surprisingly sincere in his hopes for the place and had doubtless staked all he had on the business.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What in heaven's name was the real essence of this beauty?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Was it the precision of nature with its physical laws, or was it nature's mercilessness, ceaselessly resisting man's understanding?Until yesterday the very thought of this landscape had filled him with nausea.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had actually thought, in a fit of spleen, that the holes were just right for swindlers like picture-postcard vendors.However, there was no reason to think of the life in the holes and the beauty of the landscape as being opposed to each other.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Beautiful scenery need not be sympathetic to man.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His own viewpoint in considering the sand to be a rejection of the stationary state was not madness… a 1/8-mm.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
flow… a world where existence was a series of states.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The beauty of sand, in other words, belonged to death.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was the beauty of death that ran through the magnificence of its ruins and its great power of destruction.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
No.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Just a minute.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He would be in a spot if he were criticized for holding on to his round-trip ticket and not letting go of it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"You like movies of wild animals and of war because you find that the same old day, following the same old yesterday, is waiting for you as soon as you come out of the movie house… you even like the films that stick so close to reality they nearly give you a heart attack.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Is anybody really foolish enough to go to the movies with a real gun, loaded with real bullets?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Certain kinds of mice that are said to drink their own urine in place of water, or insects that feed on spoiled meat, or nomadic tribes who know only the one-way ticket at best, can adjust their lives to the desert.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If from the beginning you always believed that a ticket was only one-way, then you wouldn't have to try so vainly to cling to the sand like an oyster to a rock.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But nomads have gone so far as to change their name to ""stock breeders,"" so…Yes, perhaps he should have spoken about this scenery to the woman.Perhaps he should have sung her the song of the sands, which has absolutely no room for a round-trip ticket, even though he might have sung it badly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At best he had given a poor imitation of a gigolo trying to catch a woman by dangling the bait of a different kind of life.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But with his face pressed in the sand, he had been like a cat in a paper bag.The light on the ridge suddenly vanished.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The whole landscape sank into darkness before his eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Unnoticed, the wind had died down, and now the mist was coming back strongly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
That was probably why the sun had set so abruptly.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Well then, let's go!25HE would have to escape by passing through the village before the basket gangs began their work.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Judging by experience, there should be about an hour left or, to be on the safe side, forty-five minutes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The spit of the promontory, as if embracing the village, gradually curved in toward the land, reaching as far as the inlet on the east side and squeezing the village road into a single lane.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There the sheer cliffs of the promontory ended in what seemed to be slightly elevated, washed-out dunes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he went straight ahead, keeping the mist-shrouded lights of the village on his right, he could expect to come out just about where the cliffs stopped.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It would be a little over a mile.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And beyond that lay the outskirts of the village.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could not remember any houses, only occasional plots of peanuts here and there.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he could just get across the dunes, then it would probably be safe to walk down the road.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At least the roadbed was red clay, and if he were to run with all his might it would take him about fifteen minutes to get to the highway.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he could get that far, then he would have won the game.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Buses would be running, and people would be in their right minds.Thus, according to his calculations, he had thirty minutes to get through the village.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"What was bad about the sand was that one wasted strength, not because one's feet sank into it but because there was no resistance.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Running was most wasteful of all.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Walking with long, careful steps would probably be more effective.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And yet, the sand compensated for sucking away one's strength by deadening the sound of footsteps.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was good, at least, that he didn't have to worry about his footsteps being heard.Well, look where you're walking!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It didn't really make any difference whether he fell or not, and he frequently would stumble on the little rises and hollows and sink to his knees.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"That was all right, but if by chance he were to fall into another sand hole, what in heaven's name would he do then?It was dark, and the sand stretched forever on in irregular undulations.There were waves within waves, and within the small ones there were many still smaller ridges and hollows.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The lights of the village, on which he had made his fix, seldom came into his view, for they were screened off by the crests of the endless undulations.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he could not see the lights, he went on by instinct.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His mistakes were always appallingly major.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Perhaps it was because his feet turned irresistibly toward the higher places, unconsciously seeking the lights.Ah!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Again he had made a mistake!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was more to the left.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
If he went on like this he would end up by going straight into the village.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Although he had crossed over three small hill-like dunes, the lights did not seem to be getting much nearer.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It seemed as if he were circling around in the same place.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perspiration ran into his eyes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He paused and took a deep breath.He wondered whether the woman was awake yet.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He also wondered what kind of reaction she would have when she did awake and realize that he was not there.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No, I she probably wouldn't realize it right away.She would I doubtless suppose he was just relieving himself behind^the house.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Tonight she would be tired.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She would be surprised she had slept until it was dark and would probably be barely able to get herself up.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Then, finally, she would remember what had happened between them in the morning from the lingering warmth between her legs, still slightly painful and dry.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She would smile bashfully as she groped for the lamp.But anyway, there was no reason for him to feel any obligation or responsibility for her smile.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"By his disappearance she would lose only a fragment of her life, one that could be easily replaced by a radio or a mirror.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""You're really a great help,"" she had said.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""It's so different from when I was alone.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"I can take it easy in the mornings, and the work is finished at least two hours sooner.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I think I'll ask the village association to give me some kind of extra work to do at home.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I'll save the money.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And someday, maybe I'll be able to buy a radio or a mirror or something.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""(Radio and mirror… radio and mirror…) As if all of human life could be expressed in those two things alone.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Radios and mirrors do have a point in common: both can connect one person with another.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Maybe they reflect cravings that touch the core of our existence.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"All right, when he got home he would buy a radio right away and send it off to her.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He would put all the money he had into the best transistor on the market.But he couldn't promise the minor so easily.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A mirror would go bad here.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The quicksilver on the back would peel , off in half a year; even the surface of the glass would get cloudy with the constant chafing of the sand in the air.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Just like the mirror she had now: you looked in it with one eye, and you couldn't see your nose… and if you could see your nose you couldn't see your mouth.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No, it didn't matter to him how long it lasted.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A mirror was different from a radio; for it to be a means of connection she would first have to have somebody else there to see her.What use would a mirror be to someone who no longer could be seen?She would be feeling surprised about now.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She'd prick up her ears.Wasn't he taking too long about his business?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He certainly was… the rascal had been clever enough to get awayl Would she set up a howl?he wondered.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Would she collapse?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Or would her eyes just dim with tears?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Whatever she did, it was no longer his responsibility.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was the one who had refused to recognize the necessity for a minor.—It's a story I read some place… Leaving home is all the fashion now.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"I thought it was because of bad living conditions, but that doesn't seem to be the only reason.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"They mentioned a middle-class farm family that had recently added land to its holdings, bought machinery, and was doing quite well, when the eldest son suddenly left home.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was a quiet, hard-working young man, and his parents were completely puzzled; they didn't know why.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In country villages you have social obligations and reputation to think of, so there really must have been a reason for the heir of the family to have left home…—Yes, certainly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"An obligation is an obligation.—Then, it appears that one of the relatives took th$ trouble to find the young man and hear his story.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He wasn't living with a woman, and he didn't seem to be driven by debts or pleasure; there was no single concrete motive.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Then whatever was the reason?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And what the young man said made absolutely no sense at all.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He seemed unable to explain it very well himself, beyond saying he just couldn't stand it any longer.—There really are foolish people in the world, aren't there!—But when you think about it, you can understand his feelings.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When farmers increase their workable land they have that much more to do.In the final analysis, there's no end to their labor, and they only wind up with more to do.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"However, the farmer at least has a return on his potatoes and rice.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Compared with a farmer's work, shoveling away the sand is like trying to pile up rocks in the River of Hades, where the devils cart them off as fast as you throw them in.—Well, what happens with the River of Hades in the end?—Not a thing.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It's an infernal punishment precisely because nothing happens.—Well then, what happened to the son after that?—He had planned the whole thing in advance and had probably even settled on a job beforehand.—And then what did he do?—Well, he went and took his job.—And after that?—Well, after that he probably got his pay on payday, and on Sundays I suppose he put on a clean shirt and went to the movies.—And then…?—We'll never know unless we put the question to him directly, will we?—And when he saved up some money, he probably bought himself a radio, didn't he…?At last, he thought, he had finished his climbing, but he had come only halfway.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No, that was wrong.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was already flat here.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Where had the lights that he had fixed on gone to?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He continued walking with a feeling of disbelief.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The place where he stood was apparently the ridge of a rather high dune.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Why ever couldn't he see the lights from here?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A feeling of apprehension paralyzed his legs.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps his previous laziness was the cause of his failure.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He slid down the steep slope, heedless of the direction.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was an unexpectedly long ravine, not only deep but wide too.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Many lines of rippling sand lay tangled and confused at the bottom; they troubled his judgment.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even so, he couldn't understand at all why the lights of the village were not visible.His margin of error was not more than a half mile on either side of his line of advance.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He may have missed his way, but it could not be serious.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He wanted to go left, but, perhaps because of his fear of the village, he also felt he should strike out boldly to the right in order to get nearer to the lights.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Soon the mist would lift and the stars would come out.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The quickest way, in effect, would be to climb up to any elevated place, regardless of where it was, and get the best perspective he could.Still, he couldn't understand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He did not understand at all the reason why the woman had to be so attached to that River of Hades… Love of Home and obligation have meaning only if one stands to lose something by throwing them away.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What in the world did she have to lose?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
(Radio and mirror… radio and mirror…)Of course he would send her a radio.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But wouldn't it work out, to the contrary, that she would lose more than she would gain?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"For instance, there would be no ceremony of giving him a bath, which she liked so much.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She always used to save water for washing him, even at the expense of the laundry.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She would splash warm water between his legs and, quite as if she were doing it to herself, bend over squealing in laughter.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There would not be another chance for her to laugh like that again.No, she shouldn't be under any misapprehension.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"From the beginning there had been no contract between him and her, and since there had been no contract there could be no breach of contract.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Furthermore, he too was not completely untouched.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"For instance, the stink of the cheap sake"" that came once a week and seemed as if it had been squeezed from a compost heap… the flexing of the flesh on the inner side of her thighs where he could see the muscles standing out in ridges… the sense of shame in scraping away, with a finger he had wet in his mouth, the sand like burnt rubber that had gathered on the dark lips of her vulva… And her bashful smile that had made these things appear more indecent.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he added them all up, they would come to quite a lot.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even if his involvement seemed unbelievable, it was nonetheless a fact.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A man, more than a woman, tends to abandon himself to bits and pieces of things.When he thought about what the villagers had done, he realized that it would be almost impossible to calculate the harm he had suffered.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The relationsip between him and the woman was of little importance.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He intended sometime to take a full measure of revenge on them.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He hadn't yet decided what would be the worst.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At first he had thought of setting fire to the whole village, or putting poison in the wells, or laying a trap to lure them one by one into a hole in the sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had spurred himself on, whipping up his imagination by thinking up such direct measures.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But now that he would have the opportunity of actually putting them into practice, he couldn't continue thinking such childish things.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"After all, the violence of a single person wouldn't amount to much.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The only way was to make his complaint to the authorities.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even if he did, he was somewhat concerned as to how much of the cruel significance of the experience they would grasp.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Well, for the time being, he would report it at least to the pre-fectural police.Ah yes, and then there was one more thing…Wait!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What was that noise?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He could no longer hear it Maybe it had been his imagination.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"By the way, wherever had the lights of the village gone?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even though the land was uneven, it was really too absurd that they were nowhere to be seen.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could easily conceive that he had tended to swing to the left and, having veered too far in the direction of the promontory, was screened from the village by some high ridges.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He could waste no time.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He would strike out boldly to the right.… Finally, there was one more thing he did not want her to forget… she had never been able to answer his question.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It had been raining for two days.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When it rained, the force of the sand slides increased, but there was much less flying sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Since they had done a little extra work on the first day of rain, they had been able to take it easy on the next.Taking advantage of the first period of leisure in some time, he had determined to push on tenaciously with a project.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had decided he would try to get at the reason that kept her in the hole, and he would go about it with the same patience one has in picking at a scab left from some skin disease.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His perseverance had surprised even himself.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At first she had cheerfully let the rain strike on her naked body, but at last she had been driven to the point of tears.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Finally she began to say something to the effect that she couldn't leave simply because of the remains of her child and her husband, who had been buried along with the chicken houses on the day of the typhoon.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Well, that was understandable.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was quite rational of her, and he could even comprehend her reticence in not speaking to him about it until then.But anyway, he had decided to believe her; he at once determined on the following day to devote some of his sleeping time to looking for the remains.He had continued digging for two days at the place she had indicated.But he had not found even a trace of the chicken houses, to say nothing of any bones.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Then she had pointed out another place.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He could not find anything there either.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And then she indicated still another.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had dug vainly in this way for nine days, in five different places, and then she had begun to make excuses, looking as if she were about to begin crying again.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She had said that the location of the house had evidently changed, shifted by the constant pressure of the sands.Or perhaps it might have been that the hole itself had shifted.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She had also said that the chicken houses and the remains of her husband and child might well have been buried under the thick wall of sand thatdivided her house from her neighbor's, and that they might have moved into the neighbor's garden.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was theoretically possible, certainly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Her unhappy, beaten expression obviously showed that she hadn't meant to lie, but that she had had no intention of telling him from the very beginning.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The remains, after all, were no more than an excuse.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had not had the strength to get angry.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And then he had decided to leave off trying to figure out who was indebted to whom.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She would certainly understand this, he thought, but…What's that?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He threw himself headlong to the ground.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Everything had happened too quickly; he couldn't grasp the situation.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Suddenly the village lay before him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had apparently been walking straight toward the sandy promontory that was adjacent to it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At the instant the prospect opened before him he found himself in the very center of the hamlet.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Before he could collect his thoughts, a hostile barking sounded from a nearby brushwood fence and was picked up by one dog and then another.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In the dark, a circle of white fangs pressed in upon him.He pulled out the rope with the shears, sprang up, and began to run.There was no choice.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The only thing to do was to make a direct run for the village gates.26HE ran.The houses, floating in the vague light of burning lamps, formed a maze of obstacles and passageways along the single path of his flight.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He could taste the wind wheezing through his tightened throat like luke-warm rust.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A desperate gamble on a sheet of thin glass that was already bent to the breaking point.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The basket gangs had certainly left their houses already, but it was still too soon to expect them to have covered the distance to the seashore.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In fact, he did not remember hearing the sounds of the three-wheeler.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could not possibly have missed the put-put of the crazy two-cylinder engine from at least a half mile away.The situation was extremely serious.A black lump suddenly sprang out of the shadows.It was a fairly big dog, judging from its breathing.The dog, however, had evidently received notraining in attack and had committed the blunder of barking just before it was about to sink its teeth in him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He lashed out with his rope, and the shears struck something; the dog let out a baleful howl and melted again into the shadows.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Fortunately it had only bitten into the cuff of his trousers.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His legs slipped out from under him as he recoiled, and he turned a somersault as he fell.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At once he was on his feet again and running.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"However, there was not just one dog, but, apparently, five or six.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Discouraged, perhaps, by the failure of the first, the others awaited their chance as they circled around him, barking.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Maybe the squat red dog from the shack was urging them on from behind.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Then he jumped over a mound of shells in an empty lot and ran between some narrow brushwood fences, cutting through a garden where straw was spread out to dry.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At last he came out on a broad road.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Only a little more and he would be out of the village.Just beside the road there was a small ditch.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Two children, who looked as if they were brother and sister, scrambled out.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He noticed them too late.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He did what he could to bring the rope around to the side, but it struck them and all three tumbled into the ditch.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Something like a wooden pipe lay at the bottom, and the dull sound of splintering wood accompanied their fall.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The children screamed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Damn!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Why did they have to yell so loud?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He pushed them away with all his strength and clambered out And at that very instant the beams of three flashlights lined up, blocking his way.At the same time the alarm bell started to ring.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The children were crying… the dogs were barking… and at every sound of the bell his heart jumped a beat.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His pores opened, and a thousand prickly little insects, like grains of rice, came crawling out One of the flashlights seemed to be of a type that had an adjustable focus, and just when he thought the light was dwindling it suddenly pierced him again like a white-hot needle.Should he try a frontal attack, kicking them aside as hard as he could?If he could just get across there, he would be outside the village.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He might regret the tactic later and then again he might not, but all depended on this instant.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Come on!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Don't hesitate!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he didn't seize the opportunity now, it would be too late.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He couldn't count on a second chance.Even as he was thinking this, the flashlights, poised in a half circle around him, spread out to the left and the right and slowly approached him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He grasped the rope more firmly and knew he must move, but he only stood there with his toes biting into the soft ground, unable to come to any decision.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The places between the flashlights were filled with the dark shadows of men.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And that obscure shape by the side of the road, which at first looked like a hole, was certainly the three-wheeler.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even if he were successful in getting through, he would be caught from behind.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In back of him he could hear the steps of the children, who had stopped crying, running away.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Suddenly a magnificent idea occurred to him: he would get the children and use them as a shield.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
By taking them hostage he could stop the men from coming nearer.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But when he turned to pursue them he could see other lights waiting for him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The road behind had been cut off too!He recoiled and, gathering his strength, ran back along the way he had just come.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His decision was a kind of reflex; he hoped to find some place where he could cut across the dune that lay adjacent to the promontory.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The men from the village yelled as they ran after him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His knees felt weak, as if his joints had loosened; perhaps he had been in too much of a hurry.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But for the time being, at least he seemed to have taken them by surprise, and he was able to keep enough distance between him and them in order to turn around now and then to see where they were.How far had he come?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
he wondered.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had already ruq up and down several dunes.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yet the more he strained, the more he seemed to be running vainly, dreamily, in one place.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But this was no time to reflect on efficiency.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was a taste of honey mixed with blood on the back of his tongue.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He tried to spit it out, but the substance was too viscid.He put his finger in his mouth and scraped at it.The alarm was still ringing, but it was already faraway and intermittent.The barking of the dogs, too, had become a peevish, distant chatter.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was his own breathing, like a file on metal, that was the disturbance he was aware of now.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The three pursuing lights were still in a line, wavering up and down, and while they did not seem to be coming closer, neither did they seem to be getting any further away.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was just as hard for him to run away as it was for them to run after him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
From now on it was a question of endurance.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But he could not be very optimistic about that.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The strain had perhaps lasted too long.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His mind suddenly seemed to buckle; in this moment of weakness he even hoped his strength would give out and he would have done with the whole thing.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The symptom was dangerous.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yet it was still well that he realized just how dangerous.His shoes were full of sand, and his toes began to hurt Looking around, he perceived that his pursuers had fallen back to seven or eight yards behind him, on the right Why had they gotten off the track like that?Perhaps they had tried too hard to avoid the slopes and had ended up by bungling the chase.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Apparently they were pretty tired too.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The pursuer, they often say, tires more quickly than the pursued.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He paused and hastily took off his shoes, to run barefoot.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He stuck them into his belt, since they would be a bother if he put them into his pocket.Recovering his spirits a little, he ran up a fairly steep slope in a single burst of speed.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If things went like this and he had a little luck, he might give them the slip yet.Although the moon had not risen, the countryside was splotched with faint patches of bright and dark from the starlight, and he could clearly distinguish the distant ridges.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He seemed to be heading for the end of the promontory.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Again he felt the urge to bear to the left.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As he was about to change direction, he was suddenly brought up short.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he changed, he would at once shorten the distance between his pursuers and himself.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was thunderstruck, aware for the first time of their plan.Their pursuit, which at first had seemed implausible, was in fact very well thought out: they were trying to push him in the direction of the sea.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Without knowing it, he had been guided.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he thought about it now, he realized that the flashlights were meant precisely to let him know their positions.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The way they kept their distance without coming near was certainly done on purpose.But it was still too soon to give up.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had heard that there was a way to climb up the cliffs somewhere, and if it turned out to be necessary it would not be impossible to swim over to the back of the promontory.He thought of being caught and taken back; there was no room for hesitation.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Abrupt descents followed long, gentle rises; abrupt rises, then long, gentle descents.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"One foot after another… one step added to the next, like stringing beads… patiently… patiently.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Unnoticed, the alarm had ceased.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He could no longer distinguish between the sounds of the wind and sea and the ringing in his ears.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He ran up a hillock and looked around.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The pursuers' lights had disappeared.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He waited for a moment, but they did not reappear.Had he really gotten away?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
he wondered.His rising hope made his heart beat faster.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If it were true, it was all the more reason he should not relax now… one more dash… on to the next rise!Suddenly it was hard to run.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His legs felt strangely heavy.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was not only the feeling of heaviness: his legs had actually begun to sink.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was like being in snow, he thought, and by then he had sunk to his calves.Astonished, he pulled out one foot and the other sank quickly until he was knee-deep.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What was happening?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had heard of sand that swallowed people up.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He struggled, trying to extricate himself some way, but the more he struggled, the more deeply he sank.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
His two legs were already buried up to the thighs.Ah!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
So this was the trap!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Their target had not been the sea at all, but here!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They intended quite simply to liquidate him without even going to the trouble of capturing him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Liquidation indeed!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Even a sleight-of-hand artist could not have done it more smoothly with his handkerchief.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Another puff of wind and he would be completely gone.Even the best police dog would be helpless.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The bastards didn't even have to show their faces any more.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They hadn't seen anything or heard anything.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A stupid outsider had lost his way by himself and had vanished.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They had managed the whole thing without soiling their hands in the slightest.Sinking… sinking… soon he would be up to his waist… What in God's name could he do?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he could increase the area of contact with the sand, his body weight per square inch would be lighter, and perhaps he would be able to arrest the sinking somewhat.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He flopped down, his arms spread out.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"However, it was already too late.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had intended to lie on his stomach, but the lower half of his body was now fixed vertically in the sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was impossible to keep his already exhausted hips at a right angle for any length of time.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Unless one were a trained trapeze artist, sooner or later there would be a limit to this position.How dark it was.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The whole world had closed its eyes and stopped its ears.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
No one would even turn around to look at his death spasms.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Fear convulsed his throat and suddenly burst out His jaw dropped open, and he gave an animal-like cry.""Help!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The stock expression!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Well, let it be a stock expression.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
What was the use of individuality when one was on the point of death?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He wanted to go on living under any circumstances, even if his life had no more individuality than a pea in a pod.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Soon he would be up to his chest, to his chin, to his nose… Stop!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"This was enough!""Help!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Please!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I'll promise anything!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Please!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Help!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Please!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""At last he began to weep.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At first his sobbing remained under control, but soon it changed to unrestrained bawling.He submitted to his fear with the horrible feeling that all was lost.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There was no one to see him, it made no difference.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was too unfair that all this was actually happening without any of the formalities being observed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When a condemned criminal died, he at least left a record.He would yell as much as he wanted.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Since no one was there to see…he might as well…And so, when voices called to him suddenly from behind, his surprise was all the more shattering.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was completely defeated.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Even his feeling of shame vanished like the shriveled ash of a dragonfly's wing.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Hey, there!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Take hold of this!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""A long piece of board slid down to him and hit his side.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A circle of light cut through the darkness and fell on the board.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He twisted the disabled upper part of his body, entreating the men he felt were behind him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Pull me up with this rope, won't you?…""""No, no.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"We can't pull you out as if you were a root.""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A laughing voice broke out behind him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could not be sure, but there seemed to be four or five of them.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Just hold on a little longer; we've sent for a shovel.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Just put your elbows on that piece of wood and you'll be all right.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""He placed his elbows as he was told and cradled his head in his arms.His hair was soaked with perspiration.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He felt no particular emotion except that he wanted to have done with this shameful situation as quickly as possible.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Say, there… You're lucky we followed you.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
This is a regular mush around here; even the dogs stay away.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"You really were in danger… Lots of people have wandered in here without knowing it, and they've never come back.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The place is a mountain cove; there's a lot of drifting.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In winter the snows blow over, and the sand over that, then the snow comes again.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
This has been going on for about a hundred years until it's become like a pile of thin crackers.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At least that's what the old union chiefs second boy said, the one who went to school in town.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It's interesting, isn't it?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If you dig down to the bottom you may find something valuable…""Whatever was he telling him this for?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could stop talking so innocently any time, as if he didn't know the truth!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It would be better if he would just show his colors.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Or he would at least prefer to be left alone with his own tattered resignation.At length there was a commotion behind him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The shovel had evidently arrived.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Three men wearing boards attached to the soles of their shoes clumsily began to shovel around him in a wide circle.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
They stripped the sand away in layers.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His dreams, desperation, shame, concern with appearances—all were buried under the sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And so, he was completely unmoved when their hands touched his shoulders.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If they had ordered him to, he would have dropped his trousers and defecated before their very eyes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The sky had grown lighter, and it looked as though the moon would soon rise.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
How would the woman welcome him back?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It really made no difference to him any more.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Now, he was nothing more than a punching bag to be knocked around.27A ROPE was passed under his arms, and like a piece of baggage, he was again lowered into the hole.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
No one said a word; it was as if they were at an interment.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The hole was deep and dark.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The moonlight enveloped the dune landscape in a silken light, making the footprints and the ripples of sand stand out like pleated glass.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But the hole, refusing a role in the scenery, was pitch-black.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It didn't particularly bother him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was so exhausted that merely raising his head to look at the moon made him feel dizzy and nauseated.The woman was a black splotch against the black.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She walked with him as he went toward the bed, but for some reason he could not see her at all.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No, it was not the woman alone; everything around him was blurred.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even after he had fallen onto the bed, in his mind he was still running with all his might over the sands.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Even in his dreaming he continued to run.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But his sleep was light.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The memory remained of the distant barking of the dogs, and he could hear the coming and going of the baskets.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was aware that the woman had come back from her work once during the night for something to eat and that she had lit the lamp beside his pillow to eat by.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He awoke completely when he got up for a drink of water.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But still he did not have enough energy to go and help her.Having nothing to do, he lit the lamp again and absent-mindedly smoked a cigarette; a fat but agile spider began to circle around the lamp.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It would be natural for a moth, but it was strange that a spider should be drawn by light.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was on the point of burning it with his cigarette, but he suddenly held back.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It continued to circle around, quite precisely, within a radius of seven to ten inches, like the second hand of a watch.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Or perhaps it was not a simple phototropic spider.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was watching it expectantly when a moth with dark-gray wings, mottled with white and black crests, came fluttering along.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Several times its enormous shadow was projected on the ceiling as it crashed against the lamp chimney; then it perched on the metal handle, motionless.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was a strange moth despite its vulgar appearance.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He touched his cigarette to its body.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Its nerve centers were destroyed, and he flicked the writhing insect into the path of the spider.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

How clever to use the lamp in place of a web.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In a web it could only wait passively, but with the lamp it could engage its prey.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"However, a suitable light was the prerequisite of the method.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was impossible to get such a light naturally.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It would not do to look for a forest fire or wander about under the moon.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Could this be a new species of spider, then, that had developed its instincts by evolving with man?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It wasn't a bad hypothesis.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But, in that case, how could you explain the attraction of a moth for light?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A moth is different from a spider, and lamplight can hardly be thought of as useful in maintaining the species.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And yet the point was the same: both phenomena had come about after man-made lights had come into being.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The fact that moths did not all go flying off to the moon was irrefutable proof of it.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It would be understandable if this were the habit of only one species of moth.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But since it was common to moths of about ten thousand varieties, he could only assume that it was an immutable law.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"This crazy, blind beating of wings caused by man-made light… this irrational connection between spiders, moths, and light.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"He was slow, as if he were forcing his way through the musty pages of some book.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Yet he was able to turn the pages.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

It was as if the sand had filled his whole skin.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
(What was the other woman doing now?he wondered.),Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"What had happened before yesterday seemed like ages ago.The woman began to rub some soap on a wet cloth.PART III28OCTOBER.During the day the traces of summer, reluctant to depart, still set the sand afire, and their bare feet could not stand it for more than five minutes at a time.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But when the sun set, the crack-ridden walls of the room let in the cold night damp, and they had to get on with the work of drying out the wet ashes in the hearth.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Because of the change in temperature on windless mornings and evenings, the mist rose like a muddy river.One day he tried setting a trap to catch crows in the empty space behind the house.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He named it ""Hope.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The device was exceptionally simple.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It made use of the special properties of the sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He dug a rather deep hole, and in the bottom he buried a wooden bucket.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
With three sticks the size of matches he propped open a cover slightly smallerthan the mouth of the bucket.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Toeach stick he tied a thin thread.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Thethreads ran through a hole in themiddle of the lid and were connected to a wire on the outside.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
To the end of the wire he attached a piece of dried fish as bait And the whole thing was carefully concealed with sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
From the outside the only thing visible was the bait at the bottom of a sand bowl.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As soon as a crow took the bait, the sticks would slip out, the lid would fall down, the sand would slide in, and the crow would be buried alive.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had made two or three trial runs; everything worked perfectly.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could visualize the pitiful figure of the crow swallowed up by the sliding sand, without having had the time even to flap its wings.And then he would write a letter and fasten it to the crow's leg.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, it was all a question of luck.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In the first place, the possibility was very slight that, when he released the crow, it would fall into anyone's hands.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He would never know where it would fly off to.Usually, the radius of a crow's flight was very limited.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The worst risk was that the villagers would notice one crow in the flock with a piece of white paper attached to its legs and leam all about his plans.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"All his long-suffering patience would have been for nought.Since he had failed in his escape, he had become extremely cautious.He adjusted himself to the life of the hole, as if it were a kind of hibernation, concentrating his efforts on making the villagers relax their vigilance.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Repetition of the same patterns, they say, provides an effective form of protective coloring.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he were to melt into a life of simple repetition, there might possibly come a time when they could be quite unconscious of him.There was another effective element in repetition.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"For example, the woman had devoted herself for the last two months, day in and day out, to stringing beads, concentrating so fiercely that her face seemed bloated.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Her long needle seemed to dance as she picked up with its fine tip the metallic beads scattered in the bottom of a cardboard box.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He estimated her savings to be around two thousand yen, enough to make a down payment on a radio in another two weeks.There was an importance about the dancing needle that made him feel it was the center of the world.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Her repetitious movements gave color to the present and a feeling of actuality.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The man, not to be outdone, decided to concentrate likewise on some especially monotonous handwork.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Sweeping sand from the ceiling, sifting rice, washing—such work had already become his major daily occupations.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The time flew by, at least while he was at work.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His invention of a small tent made of plastic to shelter them from the sand while they slept, and the device for steaming fish by burying it in hot sand—such things made time pass rather pleasantly.Since he had come back, in order not to upset himself, he had really tried to get along without reading any newspapers.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"After a week, he had no longer thought about reading.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"After a month, he almost forgot there were such things as newspapers.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Once he had seen a reproduction of an engraving called ""Hell of Loneliness"" and had thought it curious.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In it a man was floating unsteadily in the air, his eyes wide with fright, and the space around him, far from being empty, was so filled with the semi-transparent shadows of dead persons that he could scarcely move.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The dead, each with a different expression, were trying to push one another away, talking ceaselessly to the man.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"What was this ""Hell of Loneliness""?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
he wondered.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Perhaps they had misnamed it, he had thought then, but now he could understand it very well.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Loneliness was an unsatisfied thirst for illusion.And so, one bit one's nails, unable to find contentment in the simple beating of one's heart… one smoked, unable to be satisfied with the rhythm of one's brain… one had the shakes, unable to find satisfaction in sex alone.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Breathing, walking, bowel movements, daily schedules, Sundays coming every seven days, final exams after every four months, far from quieting him, had had the effect rather of pushing him toward a new repetition of them.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Soon his cigarette smoking had increased, and he had had terrible nightmares in which he was looking for a hiding place away from the eyes of people with a woman who had dirty fingernails, and when finally he noticed that he was beginning to show toxic symptoms, he suddenly awoke to the heavens governed by an extremely simple elliptic cycle, and the sand dunes ruled by the i/8-mm.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"wavelengths.Even though he felt a certain gentle contentment in the handwork which he performed daily and in the repeated battle with the sand, his reaction was not quite masochistic.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He would not find it strange if such a cure really existed.But one morning, along with the regular deliveries, he was presented with a cartoon magazine.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The magazine was nothing in itself.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The cover was worn and greasy with fingerprints; it must have been something they had gotten from a junkman.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Yet, except for the fact that it was dirty, it was the kind of thoughtfulness the villagers were likely to display.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"What puzzled him was that he had rolled over in laughter at it, beating the floor and writhing as if he were having convulsions.The cartoons were exceedingly stupid.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"They were meaningless, vulgar sketches that had been dashed off, and had he been asked, he would never have been able to explain why they were so amusing.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"One was so very funny only because of the expression on the face of a horse that had fallen down, its legs broken under the weight of the big bruiser who had mounted it.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
How could he laugh so when he was in such a position?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Shame on him!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was a limit to how far he should accommodate himself to his present plight.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had intended this accommodation to be a means, never a goal.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It sounded all right to talk of hibernating, but had he changed into a mole and lost all desire to show his face in the sunlight again for the rest of his life?When he thought about it, he realized there was absolutely no way of knowing when and in what way an opportunity for escape would come.It was possible to conceive of simply becoming accustomed to waiting, with no particular goal in mind, and when his hibernation was at last over, he would be dazzled by the light, unable to come out.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Three days a beggar, always a beggar, they say.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Such internal rot apparently comes on unexpectedly fast.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was thinking seriously about this, but the moment he recalled the expression on the horse's face he was again seized with moronic laughter.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In the lamplight the woman, concentrating as usual on the fine work of stringing beads, raised her head and smiled back at him innocently.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could not bear his own deception, and, tossing the magazine away, he went out.A milky mist billowed and swirled above the cliff.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Spaces of shadow, speckled with the remains of night… spaces that sparkled as if with glowing wire… spaces flowing with particles of shining vapor.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The combination of shadows was filled with fantasies and stirred limitless reveries in him.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He would never tire of looking at the sight.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Every moment overflowed with new discoveries.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Everything was there, actual shapes confounded with fantastic forms he had never seen before.He turned toward the swirling mass and appealed to it involuntarily.—Your Honor, I request to be told the substance of the prosecution.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I request to be told the reason for my sentence.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"You see the defendant before you, awaiting your pleasure.Then a voice he remembered hearing before answered him from the mist.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It sounded suddenly muffled, as if it were coming through a telephone.—One out of every hundred, after all…—What did you say?—I am telling you that in Japan schizophrenia occurs at the rate of one out of every hundred persons.—What in the name of…—Kleptomania also seems to occur in about one out of every hundred.—What in the name of heaven are you talking about?—If there is one per cent of homosexuality among men, then naturally there must also be about one per cent of lesbianism among women.Incendiaries account for one per cent; those who tend to be vicious drinkers, for one per cent; mentally retarded, one per cent; sexual maniacs, one per cent; megalomaniacs, one per cent; habitual swindlers, one per cent; frigid women, one per cent; terrorists, one per cent; paranoiacs, one per cent…—I wish you'd stop talking nonsense.—Well, listen to me calmly.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Acrophobes, heroin addicts, hysterics, homicidal maniacs, syphilitics, morons—suppose there were one per cent of each of these, the total would be twenty per cent.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
If you could enumerate eighty more abnormalities at this rate—and of course you could—there would be statistical proof that humanity is a hundred per cent abnormal.—What nonsense!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Abnormality would not come into being if there were no standard of normality!—Come, come.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

Why does resisting illegal detention make me a strange bird?—Don't pretend you're so innocent.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In Japan, a typical area of high humidity and heat, eighty-seven per cent of annual damage is by water; damage by wind-blown sand, as in your case, would hardly come to a thousandth of one per cent.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"You're a valuable possession for the villagers…—Oh, balls!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even I have more of a reason for existence than that—You're quite sure it's all right to find fault with your beloved sand?—Fault?—I hear there are people in the world who, over a period of ten years, have calculated the value of pi to several hundred decimal places.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"All right, I suppose they have that much reason for existence.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But you took the trouble of coming to such a place as this precisely because you rejected such a reason for existence.—No, that's not true.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Even sand has a completely opposite face.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You can use it to make casting molds.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And it's also an indispensable material for setting concrete.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"No matter from what angle he looked, he could find nothing suspicious about the trap.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Crows were uncommonly cautious because they scavenged for human refuse around where people lived.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Well then, it was a question of who would have the most patience… until they became completely accustomed to the rotten fish in the hole.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Patience itself was not necessarily defeat.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

"Or maybe they were mindless man-eating plants, or avaricious sea anemones, and he was supposed to be a pitiful victim who happened to be in their clutches.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But from the standpoint of the villagers, they themselves were the ones who had been abandoned.Naturally there was no reason why they should be under obligation to the outside world.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes

It was the marrow of his bones rather than the surface of his skin that was trembling.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And it was like ripples of water, spreading in slowly widening circles out from the center.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A dull and ceaseless ache echoed from bone to bone.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was as if a rusty tin can, clattering along in the wind, had gone through his body.As he stood there, trembling, looking at the moon, a series of associated ideas occurred to him.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The surface of the moon was like a grainy, powder-covered scar… cheap, dried-out soap… a rusty aluminum lunchbox.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Then, as it came into focus, it assumed an unexpected form: a white skull—the universal symbol for poison… white, powder-covered tablets at the bottom of his insect bottle… an amazing resemblance between the texture of the moon's surface and that of the efflorescent tablets of potassium cyanide.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He wondered if the bottle were still hidden under the ledge that ran around the earthen floor, near the entrance, where he had left it.His heart began to jump irregularly, like a broken ping-pong ball.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Why did he have to think up such sinister things?… A pretty sad association of ideas.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And even if he hadn't, the October wind carried an oppressive echo of regret, its reedy voice sounding through empty, seedless husks.As he looked up at the rim of the hole, faintly limned in the moonlight, he mused that this searing feeling of his was perhaps jealousy.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Maybe it was a jealousy of all things that presented a form outside the hole: streets, trolley cars, traffic signals at intersections, advertisements on telephone poles, the corpse of a cat, the drugstore where they sold cigarettes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Just as the sand nibbled aw?y at the insides of the wooden walls and the uprights, so his jealousy was gnawing holes in him, making him like an empty pot on a stove.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But the temperature of an empty pot rises quickly.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And it might happen that soon, unable to stand the heat any longer, he would give up.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"First came the problem of weathering this moment, before he could talk about hope.He wanted lighter air!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At least fresh air, unmixed with his own breath.How wonderful it would be if once a day, even for a half hour, he could climb up the cliff and look out over the sea.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He should be allowed to do that much.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Their check on him was too strict for him to escape, and then too it would seem to be a very reasonable request, considering the faithful work he had performed for them over more than three months.Even a prisoner in confinement had the right to a period of exercise.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""I really can't stand it!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If I keep on like this, sticking my nose in the sand every day in the year, I'll turn into a human pickle!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I wonder if I could get them to let me walk around once in a while?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The woman kept her mouth closed as if annoyed.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She looked like someone who does not know what to do with a peevish child who has lost his candy.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""I won't let them say I can't!""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Suddenly the man became angry.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He even mentioned the rope ladder, so hard for him to talk about because of the loathsome memories.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The other day, when I was running away, I saw it with my own eyes.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Some houses in this row actually had rope ladders hanging down to them.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""Yes… but…"" she said timidly as if apologizing, ""most of those people have been living there for generations.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""Well, do you mean that there's no hope for us?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The woman bent her head with resignation, like a dejected dog.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even if he swallowed the potassium cyanide before her very eyes, she would probably let him go through with it without saying a word.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""All right.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I'll try to negotiate directly with them.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""However, in his heart he did not expect that such negotiations would be successful.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He was quite used to being disappointed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And so, when the old man at once brought back an answer with the second gang of basket bolsters, he was surprised and bewildered.But his surprise was unimportant compared with the contents of the answer.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Well, let's see…"" the old man said slowly and falteringly, speaking as if he were arranging his old papers in his head.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""It's, ah… not… ah…absolutely impossible to arrange… Well, this is just an example, but if the two of you came out front… with all of us watching you… and if you'd go to it… and let us see… Well, what you want is reasonable enough, so we've all decided… uh… that it's all right…""""What do you mean, let you see?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""Well… uh… the two of you… doing it together… that's what we mean.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Around him the gang of basket carriers suddenly broke out in a mad laughing.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The man stood numbly, as if someone v/ere strangling him, but slowly he began to understand exactly what they meant.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And he began to understand that he understood.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Once he had comprehended, their proposal didn't seem particularly surprising.The beam of a flashlight skimmed by his feet like some golden bird.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As if it were a sign, seven or eight more shafts fused into a dish of light and began to creep around the bottom of the hole.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Overpowered by the burning, resinous ardor of the men at the top of the cliff he was almost caught up in their madness before he could resist.Slowly he turned toward the woman.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She had been wielding her shovel there until a moment ago, and now she had vanished.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Had she fled into the house?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He looked in at the door and called to her.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""What shall we do?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""The woman's muffled voice came from directly behind the wall.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Let them be!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""But I want to get out I really do…""""But how can you...""You mustn't take it so seriously.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""""Have you gone out of your mind?""",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
the woman suddenly gasped.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""You must have.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You've left your senses.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I couldn't do a thing like that.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
I'm not sex-mad.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Was it really true?",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
he wondered.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Had he gone out of his mind?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He winced from the woman's vehemence, but inside him spread a kind of perverse blankness.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had been trampled this much… what difference could appearances make now?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If there was something wrong from the standpoint of the one who was being watched, then there was just as much wrong from that of the ones who were watching.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
There was no need to distinguish between watcher and watched.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There might still be some difference between them, but this little ceremony would be enough to make it vanish.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And just think what he could get as a prize…ground on which he could walk where he wished.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He wanted to take a deep breath with his face above the surface of this stagnant water!Sensing where the woman was, he suddenly threw his whole body upon her.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Her cries and the sound of the two of them, entangled, falling against the sand wall, roused an animal-like excitement and frenzy at the top of the cliff.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Whistling, clapping… obscene, wordless screams…The number of watchers had grown and now included some young women among the men.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And the number of flashlights whose light flooded over the doorway had increased at least three times.He had been successful, perhaps because he had taken her by surprise.Somehow he was able to drag her outside, holding her by the collar.She was a dead, baglike weight.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The lights, in a tight semicircle around three sides of the hole, were like the bonfires of some nocturnal festival.Although it was not really that hot, perspiration like a layer of flayed skin poured from his armpits, and his hair was soaked as if he had poured water over it.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The cries of the onlookers were like compressed reverbera tions, filling the sky over his head with great black wings.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He felt as if the wings were his own.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could feel the breathless villagers looking down from the top of the cliff, so clearly they could have been himself.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"They were a part of him, their viscid, drooling saliva was his own desire.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
In his mind he was the executioner's representative rather than the victim.The string of her trousers was unexpectedly troublesome.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was dark, and his trembling fingers seemed twice as clumsy as-usual.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When at last he had torn them off, he grabbed her buttocks in his two hands and shifted his hips under her, but at that instant she twisted her body and wrenched away.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He churned through the sand as he tried to catch her, but again he was pushed back with a steel-like resistance.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He grabbed her violently, entreating: ""Please!",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Please!,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"I can't really do it anyway…just pretend…""However, there was no need to grasp at her any longer.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
She had already lost all desire to escape.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He heard a noise of cloth tearing, and at the same instant he was struck a terrible blow in the belly by the point of her shoulder, which bore the weight and anger of her whole body.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He simply grasped his knees and bent in two.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The woman, leaning over him, struck his face again and again with her fists.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At first her movements seemed slow, but each blow, delivered as though she were pounding salt, carried weight.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Blood gushed from his nose.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Sand clung to the blood; his face was a lump of earth.The excitement at the top of the cliff rapidly folded like an umbrella with broken ribs.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Although they tried to join their voices of discontent and laughter and urging into one, they were already out of step and ragged.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The obscene and drunken boos and hisses did nothing to arouse enthusiasm.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Someone threw something, but he was at once reproved by someone else.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The end was as abrupt as the beginning.Cries urging the men back to work trailed in the distance, and the line of lights disappeared as if they had been drawn in.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"All that remained was the dark north wind, blowing away the last traces of excitement.But the man, beaten and covered with sand, vaguely thought that everything, after all, had gone as it was written it should.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The idea was in a corner of his consciousness, like a. sodden undergarment, where only the beating of his heart was painfully clear.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The woman's arms, hot as fire, were under his armpits, and the odor of her body was a thorn piercing his nose.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He abandoned himself to her hands as if he were a smooth, flat stone in a river bed.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It seemed that what remained of him had turned into a liquid and melted into her body.31MONOTONOUS weeks of sand and night had gone by.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"""Hope,"" as before, lay neglected by the crows.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
And the bait of dried fish had become not even that.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Although spurned by the crows, it had not been spurned by the bacteria.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"One morning when he felt the end of the stick, he found that only the skin remained; the fish had turned into a black, almost liquid pulp.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"As he was changing the bait, he decided at the same time to check on the contraption.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He scraped away the sand and opened the cover; he was thunderstruck.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Water had collected at the bottom of the bucket.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"There were only about four inches, but it was more clear by far—indeed it was almost pure—than the water with the metallic film which was delivered to them daily.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Had it rained some time recently?,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
he wondered.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
No.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Not for a half month at least.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If that were true, then could it be the rain that was left from a half month ago?He would like to think so, but what puzzled him was that he knew the bucket leaked.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And when he raised it up, as he had expected, water at once began to fall from the bottom.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At that depth there could be no underground spring, and he was obliged to recognize that the escaping water was being constantly replenished from somewhere.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At least, that must be theoretically so.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But wherever could the replenishment come from in the midst of this parched sand?He could scarcely contain his gradually rising excitement There was only one answer he could think of.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
That was the capillary action of the sand.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Because the surface sand had a high specific heat, it was invariably dry, but when you dug down a little the under part was always damp.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It must be that the surface evaporation acted as a kind of pump, drawing up the subsurface water.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"When he thought about it, everything was easily explained—the enormous quantity of mist that came out of the dunes every morning and evening, the abnormal moisture which clung to the pillars and walls, rotting the wood.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In short, the dryness of the sand was not due simply to a lack of water, but rather, it would seem, to the fact that the suction caused by capillary attraction never matched the speed of evaporation.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In other words, the water was being constantly replenished.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But this water circulated at a speed unthinkable in ordinary soil.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"And it had happened that ""Hope""had cut off the circulation some place.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Probably the chance placing of the bucket and the crack around the lid had been enough to prevent evaporation of the water that had been sucked up in the bucket.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He could not yet explain exactly the placing and its relationship to the other elements, but with study he would surely be able to repeat the experiment Moreover, it should not be impossible to construct a more efficient device for storing the water.If he were successful in this experiment he would no longer have to give in to the villagers if they cut off his water.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But more important, he had found that the sand was an immense pump.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was just as if he were sitting on a suction pump.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He had to sit down for a moment and control his breathing in order to quiet the wild beating of his heart.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Of course, there was no need yet to tell anyone about this.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It would be his trump card in case of emergency.But he could not suppress the natural laughter that welled up in him.Even if he were able to keep silent about ""Hope,"" it was hard to conceal the elation in his heart.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He suddenly let out a cry and put his arms around the woman's hips from behind as she was getting the bed ready.And when she dodged away he fell over on his back and lay kicking his legs and laughing all the while.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was as if his stomach were being tickled by a paper balloon filled with some special light gas.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He felt that the hand he held to his face was floating free in the air.The woman laughed reluctantly, but it was probably only to be agreeable.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was thinking of the vast network of water veins creeping up through the sand, but the woman, on the contrary, was surely thinking that his actions were sexual advances.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
That was all right.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Only a shipwrecked person who has just escaped drowning could understand the psychology of someone who breaks out in laughter just because he is able to breathe.The fact that he was still just as much at the bottom of the hole as ever had not changed, but he felt quite as if he had climbed to the top of a high tower.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps the world had been turned upside down and its projections and depressions reversed.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Anyway, he had discovered water in this sand.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
As long as he had his device the villagers would not be able to interfere with him so easily.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"No matter how much they cut off his supply, he would be able to get along very well.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Again laughter welled up in him at the very thought of the outcry the villagers would make.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He was still in the hole, but it seemed as if he were already outside.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Turning around, he could see the whole scene.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You can't really judge a mosaic if you don't look at it from a distance.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
If you really get close to it you get lost in detail.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
You get away from one detail only to get caught in another.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps what he had been seeing up until now was not the sand but grains of sand.He could say precisely the same thing about the other woman and his former fellow teachers.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He had been con cerned up until now only with curiously exaggerated details: nostrils in a thick nose, wrinkled lips or smooth, thin lips, spatulate fingers or pointed fingers, flecked eyes, a string of warts under a collarbone, violet veins running over a breast.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
If he looked very closely at those parts alone he would feel like vomiting.But to eyes with magnifying lenses everything seemed tiny and insectlike.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The little ones crawling around over there were his colleagues having a cup of tea in the faculty room.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The one in this comer was the other woman, naked, on a dampish bed, her eyes half closed, motionless although the ash of her cigarette was about to fall.Moreover, he felt, without the slightest jealousy, that the little insects were like cookie molds.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Cookie molds have only edges and no insides.Even so, there was no need to be such a dedicated cookie maker as to be unable to resist making unneeded cookies just to use the mold.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If the chance occurred for him to renew his relationship with them, he would have to start all over again from the very beginning.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The change in the sand corresponded to a change in himself.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Perhaps, along with the water in the sand, he had found a new self.Thus, work on a water trap was added to his daily occupations.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Figures and diagrams began to accumulate—the place to bury the bucket, the shape of the bucket, the relationship between daylight hours and the rate of water accumulation, the influence of temperature and barometric pressure on the efficiency of the apparatus.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
But it was incomprehensible to the woman why he could be so enthusiastic about anything so insignificant as a crow trap.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She recognized that no man can get along without some sort of plaything, and if he was satisfied with that one, it suited her.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Moreover, she did not know why, but he had begun to show more interest in her own craft work.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It wasn't at all a disagreeable feeling.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The question of the crow trap aside, she had still benefited considerably.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"But he too had his own reasons and motives.His work on the device was unexpectedly troublesome, for it was necessary to combine many elements.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The number of materials increased, but it was hard to find a law that would govern them all.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"If he wanted to make his data more precise, he needed a radio in order to tune in the weather reports.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The radio had become their common objective.At the beginning of November he had recorded the daily intake of water at one gallon, but after that the quantity began to fall off every day.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was perhaps because of the temperature, and it appeared that he would have to await spring to try a full-scale experiment.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The long, hard winter had at last come, and bits of ice were blown along with the sand.In the meantime, in order to get a somewhat better radio, he decided to give the woman a hand with her craft work.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"One good point was that the inside of the hole was protected from the wind, yet it was unbearable with the sun scarcely visible throughout the day.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Even on days when the sand froze over, the amount that blew along in the wind did not decrease, and there was no respite from the work of shoveling.Many times the chilblains on his fingers broke and began to bleed.In some way, winter passed and spring came.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
At the beginning of March they got the radio.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
On the roof they erected a high antenna.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The woman joyfully and repeatedly voiced her wonder, turning the dial left and right for half a day.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"At the end of that month, she found herself pregnant.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Two more months went by.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Large white birds kept flying over from east to west for three days in succession, and on the following day the lower part of her body was covered with blood and she complained of violent pain.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"One of the villagers, who was said to have a veterinarian among her relatives, diagnosed it as an extra-uterine pregnancy, and it was decided to take her to the hospital in the city in the three-wheeled truck.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The man sat with her as they waited for the truck to come, letting her hold one of his hands, while with the other he kept rubbing her belly.Finally the three-wheeler stopped at the top of the cliff.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"A rope ladder was let down for the first time in a half year, and the woman, wrapped in her blankets as in a cocoon, was hauled up by rope.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"She looked at him beseechingly with eyes almost blinded by tears and mucus, until she could see him no longer.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"The man looked away as if he did not see her.Even though she had been taken away, the rope ladder remained as it was.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He hesitantly reached out and touched it with his fingertips.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"After making sure it would not vanish, he slowly began to climb up.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The sky was a dirty yellow.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"His arms and legs felt heavy, as if he had just come out of water.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
This was the long-awaited rope ladder.The wind seemed to snatch the breath from his mouth.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Circling around the edge of the hole, he climbed to a spot where he could view the sea.The sea too was a dirty yellow.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He breathed deeply, but the air only irritated his throat, and it did not taste as he had expected.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He turned around.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
A cloud of sand rose on the outskirts of the village.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"It was probably the three-wheeler with the woman, he thought.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"Oh, yes…maybe he should have told her the real significance of the trap.Something moved at the bottom of the hole.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
It was his own shadow.Just near it stood the water trap.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
One part of the framework had come loose.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
Perhaps someone had accidentally stepped on it when they had come to take the woman out.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He hastened back down the ladder to repair it The water, as his calculations had led him to expect, had risen to the fourth mark.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The damage did not appear to be too great.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In the house, someone was singing in a rasping voice on the radio.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
He tried to stifle the sobbing that seemed about to burst from him; he plunged his hands into the bucket.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
The water was piercingly cold.,Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He sank down on his knees and remained inert, his hands still in the water.There was no particular need to hurry about escaping.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"On the two-way ticket he held in his hand now, the destination and time of departure were blanks for him to fill in as he wished.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"In addition, he realized that he was bursting with a desire to talk to someone about the water trap.And if he wanted to talk about it, there wouldn't be better listeners than the villagers.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
"He would end by telling someone—if not today, then tomorrow.He might as well put off his escape until sometime after that.NOTIFICATION OF MISSING PERSONSNAME OF PERSON: Niki Jumpei DATE OF BIRTH: March 7, In view of the fact that a notice of missing person (s) has been filed by Niki Shino (mother), notification of the existence of the missing party should be made to this court by September 21, 1962.",Kobo Abe,The Woman In the Dunes
