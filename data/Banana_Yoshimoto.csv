The place I like best in this world is the kitchen.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"No matter where it is, no matter what kind, if it's a kitchen, if it's a place where they make food, it's fine with me.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Ideally it should be well broken in.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Lots of tea towels, dry and immaculate.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
White tile catching the light (ting!,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
ting!,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
").I love even incredibly dirty kitchens to distraction—vegetable droppings all over the floor, so dirty your slippers turn black on the bottom.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Strangely, it's better if this kind of kitchen is large.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I lean up against the silver door of a towering, giant refrigerator stocked with enough food to get through a winter.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When I raise my eyes from the oil-spattered gas burner and the rusty kitchen knife, outside the window stars are glittering, lonely.Now only the kitchen and I are left.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It's just a little nicer than being all alone.When I'm dead worn out, in a reverie, I often think that when it comes time to die, I want to breathe my last in a kitchen.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Whether it's cold and I'm all alone, or somebody's there and it's warm, I'll stare death fearlessly in the eye.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"If it's a kitchen, I'll think, ""How good.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Before the Tanabe family took me in, I spent every night in the kitchen.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"After my grandmother died, I couldn't sleep.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
One morning at dawn I trundled out of my room in search of comfort and found that the one place I could sleep was beside the refrigerator.My parents—my name is Mikage Sakurai—both died when they were young.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
After that my grandparents brought me up.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I was going into junior high when my grandfather died.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"From then on, it was just my grandmother and me.When my grandmother died the other day, I was taken by surprise.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"My family had steadily decreased one by one as the years went by, but when it suddenly dawned on me that I was all alone, everything before my eyes seemed false.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The fact that time continued to pass in the usual way in this apartment where I grew up, even though now I was here all alone, amazed me.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was total science fiction.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The blackness of the cosmos.Three days after the funeral I was still in a daze.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Steeped in a sadness so great I could barely cry, shuffling softly in gentle drowsiness, I pulled my futon into the deathly silent, KITCHENgleaming kitchen.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Wrapped in a blanket, like Linus, I slept.The hum of the refrigerator kept me from thinking of my loneliness.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"There, the long night came on in perfect peace, and morning came.But.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I just wanted to sleep under the stars.I wanted to wake up in the morning light.Aside from that, I just drifted, listless.However!",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I couldn't exist like that.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Reality is wonderful.I thought of the money my grandmother had left me—just enough.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The place was too big, too expensive, for one person.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I had to look for another apartment.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
There was no way around it.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I thumbed through the listings, but when I saw so many places all the same lined up like that, it made my head swim.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Moving takes a lot of time and trouble.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It takes energy.I had no strength; my joints ached from sleeping in the kitchen day and night.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
When I realized how much effort moving would require—I'd have to pull myself together and go look at places.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Move my stuff.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Get a phone in-stalled—I lay around instead, sleeping, in despair.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It was then that a miracle, a godsend, came calling one afternoon.I remember it well.Dingdong.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Suddenly the doorbell rang.It was a somewhat cloudy spring afternoon.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I was intently involved in tying up old magazines with string while glancing at the apartment listings with half an eye but no interest, wondering how I was going to move.Flustered, looking like I'd just gotten out of bed, I ran out and without thinking undid the latch and opened the door.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Thank god it wasn't a robber.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
There stood Yuichi Tanabe.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Thank you for your help the other day,"" I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"He was a nice young man, a year younger than me, who had helped out a lot at the funeral.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I think he'd said he went to the same university I did.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I was taking time off.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Not at all,"" he said.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Did you decide on a place to live yet?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Not even close.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I smiled.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I see.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Would you like to come in for some tea?""""No.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I'm on my way somewhere and I'm kind of in a hurry.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
He grinned.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I just stopped by to ask you something.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I was talking to my mother, and we were thinking you ought to come to our house for a while.""""Huh?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I said.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""In any case, why don't you come over tonight around seven?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Here's the directions.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Okay ..."" I said vacantly, taking the slip of paper.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""All right, then, good.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Mom and I are both looking forward to your coming.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
His smile was so bright as he stood in my doorway that I zoomed in for a closeup on his pupils.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I couldn't take my eyes off him.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I think I heard a spirit call my name.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Okay,"" I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I'll be there.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Bad as it sounds, it was like I was possessed.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"His attitude was so totally ""cool,"" though, I felt I could trust him.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"In KITCHENthe black gloom before my eyes (as it always is in cases of"" bewitchment), I saw a straight road leading from me to him.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
He seemed to glow with white light.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
That was the effect he had on me.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Okay, see you later,"" he said, smiling, and left.Before my grandmother's funeral I had barely known him.On the day itself, when Yuichi Tanabe showed up all of a sudden, I actually wondered if he had been her lover.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
His hands trembled as he lit the incense; his eyes were swollen from crying.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When he saw my grandmother's picture on the altar, again his tears fell like rain.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"My first thought when I saw that was that my love for my own grandmother was nothing compared to this boy's, whoever he was.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"He looked that sad.Then, mopping his face with a handkerchief, he said,""Let me help with something.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"After that, he helped me a lot.Yuichi Tanabe .",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I must have been quite confused if I took that long to remember when I'd heard grandmother mention his name.He was the boy who worked part-time at my grandmother's favorite flower shop.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I remembered hearing her say, any number of times, things like, ""What a nice boy they have working there.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
That Tanabe boy .,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"today, again ..."" Grandmother loved cut flowers.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Because the ones in our kitchen were not allowed to wilt, she'd go to the flower shop a couple of times a week.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When I thought of that, I remembered him walking behind my grandmother, a large potted plant in his arms.He was a long-limbed young man with pretty features.I didn't know anything more about him, but I might have seen him hard at work in the flower shop.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Even after I got to know him a little I still had an impression of aloofness.No matter how nice his manner and expression, he seemed like a loner.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I barely knew him, really.It was raining that hazy spring night.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"A gentle, warm rain enveloped the neighborhood as I walked with directions in hand.My apartment building and the one where the Tanabes lived were separated by Chuo Park.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"As I crossed through, I was inundated with the green smell of the night.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I walked, sloshing down the shiny wet path that glittered with the colors of the rainbow.To be frank, I was only going because they'd asked me.I didn't think about it beyond that.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I looked up at the towering apartment building and thought, their apartment on the tenth floor is so high, the view must be beautiful at night.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
".Getting off the elevator, I was alarmed by the sound of my own footsteps in the hall.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I rang the bell, and abruptly, Yuichi opened the door.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Come in.""""Thanks.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I stepped inside.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The room was truly strange.First thing, as I looked toward the kitchen, my gaze landed with a thud on the enormous sofa in the living room.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Against the backdrop of the large kitchen with its shelves of pots and pans—no table, no carpet, just ""it.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""8KITCHENCovered in beige fabric, it looked like something out of a c o m m e r c i a l .",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
An entire family could watch TV on it.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
A dog too big to keep in Japan could stretch out across it—sideways.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It was really a marvelous sofa.In front of the large window leading onto the terrace was a jungle of plants growing in bowls, planters, and all kinds of pots.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Looking around, I saw that the whole house was filled with flowers; there were vases full of spring blooms everywhere.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""My mother says she'll get away from work soon.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Take a look around if you'd like.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Should I give you the tour?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Or pick a room, then I'll know what kind of person you are,""said Yuichi, making tea.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""What kind?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"m I seated myself on the deep, comfy sofa.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I mean, what you want to know about a house and the people who live there, their tastes.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"A lot of people would say you learn a lot from the toilet,"" he said, smiling, unconcerned.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
He had a very relaxed way of talking.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""The kitchen,"" I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Well, here it is.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Look at whatever you want.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""While he made tea, I explored the kitchen.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I took everything in: the good quality of the mat on the wood floor and of Yuichi's slippers; a practical minimum of well-worn kitchen things, precisely arranged.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"A Silverstone frying pan and a delightful German-made vegetable peeler—a peeler to make even the laziest grandmother enjoy slip, slipping those skins off.Lit by a small fluorescent lamp, all kinds of plates silendy awaited their turns; glasses sparkled.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It was clear that in spite of the disorder everything was of the finest quality.There were things with special uses, like .",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"porcelain bowls, gratin dishes, gigantic platters, two beer steins.Somehow it was all very satisfying.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I even opened the small refrigerator (Yuichi said it was okay)—everything was neady organized, nothing just ""left.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I looked around, nodding and murmuring approvingly,""Mmm, mmm.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was a good kitchen.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I fell in love with it at first sight.I went back and sat on the sofa, and out came hot tea.Usually, the first time I go to a house, face to face with people I barely know, I feel an immense loneliness.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I saw myself reflected in the glass of the large terrace window while black gloom spread over the rain-hounded night panorama.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I was tied by blood to no creature in this world.I could go anywhere, do anything.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It was dizzying.Suddenly, to see that the world was so large, the cosmos so black.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The unbounded fascination of it, the unbounded loneliness.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"For the first time, these days, I was touching it with these hands, these eyes.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I've been looking at the world half-blind, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Why did you invite me here?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I asked.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""We thought you might be having a hard time,"" Yuichi said, peering kindly at me.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Your grandmother was always,so sweet to me, and look at this house, we have all this room.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Shouldn't you be moving?""""Yes.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Although the landlord's been nice enough to give me extra time.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""KITCHEN""So why not move in with us?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"he said, as though it were the most natural thing in the world.He struck just the right note, neither cold nor oppres-sively kind.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It made me warm to him; my heart welled up to the point of tears.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Just then, with the scratch of a key in the door, an incredibly beautiful woman came running in, all out of breath.I was so stunned, I gaped.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Though she didn't seem young, she was truly beautiful.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"From her outfit and dra-matic makeup, which really wouldn't do for daytime, I understood that hers was night work.Yuichi introduced me: ""This is Mikage Sakurai.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""How do you do,"" she said in a slightly husky voice, still panting, with a smile.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I'm Yuichi's mother.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
My name is Eriko.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""This was his mother?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Dumbfounded, I couldn't take my eyes off her.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Hair that rustled like silk to her shoulders; the deep sparkle of her long, narrow eyes; well-formed lips, a nose with a high, straight bridge—the whole of her gave off a marvelous light that seemed to vibrate with life force.She didn't look human.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I had never seen anyone like her.I was staring to the point of rudeness.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""How do you do,"" I replied at last, smiling back at her.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""We're so pleased to have you here,"" she said to me warmly, and then, turning to Yuichi, ""I'm sorry, Yuichi.I just can't get away tonight.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I dashed out for a second saying that I was off to the bathroom.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But I'll have plenty of time in the morning.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I hope Mikage will agree to spend the night.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She was in a rush and ran to the door, red dress flying.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I'll drive you,"" said Yuichi.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Sorry to put you to so much trouble,"" I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Not at all.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Who ever would4have thought the club would be so busy tonight?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It's me who should apologize.Well!,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
See you in the morning!,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""She ran out in her high heels, and Yuichi called back to me, ""Wait here!",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Watch TV or something!""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"then ran after her, leaving me alone in a daze.I felt certain that if you looked really closely you would see a few normal signs of age—crow's feet, less-than-perfect teeth—some part of her that looked like a real human being.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Still, she was stunning.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
She made me want to be with her again.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"There was a warm light, like her afterimage, softly glowing in my heart.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"That must be what they mean by ""charm.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Like Helen Keller when she understood ""water"" for the first time, the word burst into reality for me, its living example before my eyes.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It's no exaggera-tion; the encounter was that overwhelming.Yuichi returned, jingling the car keys.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""If she could only get away for ten minutes, she should have just called,"" he said, taking off his shoes in the entryway.I stayed where I was on the sofa and answered ""Mmm,""noncommittally.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Mikage,"" he said, ""were you a little bit intimidated by my mother?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Yes,"" I told him frankly.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I've never seen a woman that beautiful.""""Yes.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But .,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

".""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Smiling, he sat down on the floor 12k i t c h e nright in front of me.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""She's had plastic surgery.""""Oh?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I said, feigning nonchalance.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I wondered why she didn't look anything like you.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""And that's not all.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Guess what else—she's a man.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
He could barely contain his amusement.This was too much.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I just stared at him in wide-eyed silence.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I expected any second he would say, ""Just kidding.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Those tapered fingers, those mannerisms, the way she carried herself...",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I held my breath remembering that beautiful face; he, on the other hand, was enjoying this.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Yes, but..."" My mouth hung open.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""You've been saying all along, 'my mother' this, and 'my mother' that...""Yes, but.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Could you call someone who looked like that'Dad'?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
he asked calmly.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"He has a point, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
An extremely good answer.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""What about the name Eriko?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""It's actually Yuji.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
";It was as though there were a haze in front of my eyes.When I was finally ready to hear the story, I said, ""So, who gave birth to you?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Eriko was a man a long time ago.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
He married very young.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The person he married was my mother.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Wow .",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I wonder what she was like.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I couldn't imagine.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I don't remember her myself.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
She died when I was litde.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I have a picture, though.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Want to see it?""""Yes.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I nodded.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Without getting up, he dragged his bag across the floor, then took an old photograph out of his wallet and handed it to me.She was someone whose face told you nothing about her.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Short hair, small eyes and nose.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The impression was of a very odd woman of indeterminate age.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When I didn't say anything, Yuichi said, ""She looks strange, doesn't she?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I smiled uncomfortably.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""As a child Eriko was taken in by her family.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I don't know why.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
They grew up together.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Even as a man he was good-looking, and apparently he was very popular with women.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Why he would marry such a strange .,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""he said smiling, looking at the photo.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""He must have been pretty attached to my mother.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
So much so he turned his back on the debt of gratitude he owed his foster parents and eloped with her.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I nodded.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""After my real mother died, Eriko quit her job, gathered me up, and asked herself, 'What do I want to do now?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"'What she decided was, 'Become a woman.'",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
She knew she'd never love anybody else.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
She says that before she became a woman she was very shy.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Because she hates to do things halfway, she had everything 'done,' from her face to her whatever, and with the money she had left over she bought that nightclub.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She raised me a woman alone, as it were.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
He smiled.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""What an amazing life story!",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""She's not dead yet,"" said Yuichi.Whether I could trust him or whether he still had something up his sleeve .",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"the more I found out about these people, the more I didn't know what to expect.But I trusted their kitchen.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Even though they didn't KITCHENlook alike, there were certain traits they shared.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Their faces shone like buddhas when they smiled.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I like that, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I'll be out of here early in the morning, so just help yourself to whatever you want.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""A sleepy-looking Yuichi, his arms full of blankets, pil-lows, and pajamas for me, showed me how the shower worked and pointed out the towels.Unable to think of much of anything after hearing such a (fantastic!)",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"life story, I had watched a video with Yuichi.We had chatted about things like the flower shop and my grandmother, and time passed quickly.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Now it was one in the morning.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
That sofa was delectable.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It was so big, so soft, so deep, I felt that once I surrendered to it I'd never get up again.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Your mother,"" I said after a while.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I bet the first time she sat on this sofa in the furniture store, she just had to have it and bought it right then and there.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""You got it,"" he said.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""As soon as she gets an idea in her head she does it, you know?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I just stand back in amazement at her way of making things happen.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""No kidding.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""So that sofa is yours for the time being.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It's your bed.It's great for us to be able to put it to good use.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Is it,"" I ventured sofdy, ""is it really okay for me to sleep here?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Sure,"" he said, without a hint of hesitation.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I'm very grateful.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""After the usual instructions on how to make myself at home, he said good night and went to his room.I was sleepy, too.Showering at someone else's house, I thought about what was happening to me, and my exhaustions washed away under the hot water.I put on the borrowed pajamas and, barefoot, went into the silent living room.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I just had to go back for one more look at the kitchen.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was really a good kitchen.Then I stumbled over to the sofa that was to be my bed for the night and turned out the lamp.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Suspended in the dim light before the window overlooking the magnificent tenth-floor view, the plants breathed softly, resting.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"By now the rain had stopped, and the atmosphere, sparkling, replete with moisture, refracted the glittering night splendidly.Wrapped in blankets, I thought how funny it was that tonight, too, here I was sleeping next to the kitchen.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I smiled to myself.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But this time I wasn't lonely.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Maybe I had been waiting for this.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Maybe all I had been hoping for was a bed in which to be able to stop thinking, just for a little while, about what happened before and what would happen in the future.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I was too sad to be able to sleep in the same bed with anyone; that would only make the sadness worse.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But here was a kitchen, some plants, someone sleeping in the next room, perfect quiet .",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
this was the best.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
This place was .,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"the best.At peace, I slept.16I awoke to the sound of running water.Morning had come, dazzling.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I arose drowsily and went into the kitchen.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"There was ""Eriko-san,"" her back turned to me.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Her clothing was subdued compared to last night's, but as she turned to me with a cheery ""Good morning!""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"her face, even more brilliantly animated, brought me to my senses.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Good morning,"" I answered.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She opened the refrigerator, glanced inside, and looked at me with a troubled air.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""You know,"" she said, ""I'm always hungry in the morning, even though I'm still sleepy.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But there's nothing to eat in this house.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Let's call for takeout.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
What would you like?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I stood up.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Would you like me to make something?""""Really?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"she said, and then, doubtfully, ""Do you think you can handle a knife, half-asleep?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""No problem.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""The entire apartment was filled with light, like a sun-room.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I looked out at the sweet, endless blue of the sky; it was glorious.In the joy of being in a kitchen I liked so well, my head cleared, and suddenly I remembered she was a man.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I turned to look at her.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Deja vu overwhelmed me like a flash flood.The house smelled of wood.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I felt an immense nostalgia, in that downpour of morning light; watching her pull a cushion onto the floor in that dusty living room and curl up to watch TV,17• • •She attacked the food—cucumber salad and soupy rice with eggs—with gusto.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was midday.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
From the building's garden we could hear the shouts of children playing in the springlike weather.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The plants near the window, enveloped in the gende sunlight, sparkled bright green; far off in the pale sky, thin clouds gently flowed, suspended.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It was a warm, lazy afternoon.I couldn't have dreamed of this yesterday morning, this scene of having breakfast at the house of someone I had just met, and it felt very strange.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"There we were, eating breakfast, all sorts of things set out directly on the floor (there was no table).",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The sunlight shone through pur cups, and our cold green tea reflected prettily against the floor.Suddenly Eriko looked me full in the face.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Yuichi told me before that you reminded him of Woofie, a dog we used to have.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
And you know—it's really true.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""His name was Woofie?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

You really do look like him.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Is that right?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Not that I believed I looked like a dog, but I thought, if Woofie was a Saint Bernard, that would be pretty awful.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""When Woofie died I couldn't get Yuichi to eat a bite, not I grain of rice, nothing.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
So it follows that Yuichi feels 18KITCHENclose to you.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I can't guarantee it's romantic, though!",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Mom shook with laughter.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Okay,"" I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"""""Grandmother was really fond of him.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"Yours is so much better than Yuichi's,"" she said, smiling.To live alone with an old person is terribly nerve-racking, and the healthier he or she is, the more one worries.Actually, when I lived with my grandmother this didn't occur to me; I enjoyed it.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But looking back, I can't help thinking that deep down I was always, at all times, afraid:""Grandma's going to die.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""When I came home, my grandmother would come out of the Japanese-style room where the TV was and say,""Welcome home.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
If I came in late I always brought her sweets.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
She was a pretty relaxed grandmother and never gave me a hard time if I told her I was going to sleep over somewhere or whatever.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"We would spend a little time together before bed, sometimes drinking coffee, sometimes green tea, eating cake and watching TV.In my grandmother's room, which hadn't changed since I was little, we would tell each other silly gossip, talk about TV stars or what had happened that day; we talked about whatever.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I think she even told me about Yuichi during those times.No matter how dreamlike a love I have found myself in, no matter how delightfully drunk I have been, in my heart KITCHENI was always aware that my family consisted of only one other person.The space that cannot be filled, no matter how cheerfully a child and an old person are living together—the deathly silence that, panting in a corner of the room, pushes its way in like a shudder.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I felt it very early, although no one told me about it.I think Yuichi did, too.When was it I realized that, on this truly dark and solitary path we all walk, the only way we can light is our own?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Although I was raised with love, I was always lonely.Someday, without fail, everyone will disappear, scattered into the blackness of time.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I've always lived with that knowledge rooted in my being: perhaps that's why Yuichi's way of reacting to things seemed natural to me.And that's why I rushed into living with them.I gave myself permission to be lazy until May.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I was in paradise.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I still went to my part-time job, but after that I would clean house, watch TV, bake cakes: I lived like a housewife.Little by little, light and air came into my heart.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I was thrilled.What with Yuichi's school and job, and Eriko's working at night, the three of us were almost never home at the same time.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
At first I would get tired.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I wasn't used to sleeping in the living room, and I was constantly coming and going between the Tanabes' and the old apartment to get things in order, but I soon got used to it.I loved the Tanabes' sofa as much as I loved their kitchen.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I came to crave sleeping on it.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Listening to the quiet breathing of the plants, sensing the night view through the curtains, I slept like a baby.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
There wasn't anything more I wanted.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I was happy.I've always been like that—if I'm not pushed to the brink, I won't move.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
This time it was the same.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"For having been granted such a warm bed after finding myself in the direst straits, I thanked the gods—whether they existed or not—with all my heart.One day I went back to the old apartment to take care of the last of my things.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"It was like coming back to a stranger's house.Cold and dark, not a sigh to be heard.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Everything there, which should have been so familiar, seemed to be turning away from me.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I entered gingerly, on tiptoe, feeling as though I should ask permission.When my grandmother died, time died, too, in this apartment.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The reality of that fact was immediate.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
There was nothing I could do to change it.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Other than turning around and leaving, there was only one thing to do—humming a tune, I began to scrub the refrigerator.Just then the telephone rang.I picked up the receiver, knowing who it would be.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

The sky outside was a dull gray.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Waves of clouds were being pushed around by the wind with amazing force.In this world there is no place for sadness.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"No place; not one.Sotaro loved parks.Green places, open spaces, the outdoors—he loved all of that, and at school he was often to be found in the middle of a garden or sitting on a bench beside a playground.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The fact that if you wanted to find Sotaro you'd find him amid greenery had entered into university lore.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
He was planning to do some kind of work with plants.For some reason I keep getting connected to men who have something to do with plants.We were the very picture of a student couple in my happier days (Sotaro is always cheerful).,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Because of his obsession we would plan to meet outside even in the middle of winter, but I was late so often that we found a compromise meeting place.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"We hit on a ridiculously large coffee shop on the edge of the park.So this day, too, there was Sotaro, sitting in the seat nearest the park in that large coffee shop, looking out the window.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Outside, against the backdrop of the entirely overcast sky, the trees trembled in the wind, rustling.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I made my way over to him, snaking around the comings and goings of the waitresses.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"He was very tall, and I was always looking up at him.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Glancing at his profile, I thought, if I were with him, he would ... he would grab me by the hair, force me to decide on an apartment, and pull me kicking and screaming back to school.I loved his hearty robustness, I thirsted after it, but in spite of that I couldn't keep pace with it, and it made me hate myself.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"In the old days.He was the eldest son of a large family; without being aware of it he got his sunny outlook from them, and I had been drawn to it.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But what I needed now was the Tanabes'strange cheerfulness, their tranquility, and I didn't even consider trying to explain that to him.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It wasn't especially necessary, and I knew it would be impossible anyway.When I got together with Sotaro, it was always like that.Just being myself made me terribly sad.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

Yuichi helped me; he seemed to have some spare time tonight.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Something else I realized was that he hated spare time.The scratching of our pens mingled with the sound of raindrops beginning to fall in the transparent stillness of the evening.Outside, a warm wind came roaring up, a spring storm.It seemed to shake the very night view out the terrace window.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I continued down the list of my friends' names, quietly nostalgic.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I accidentally skipped Sotaro.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The wind was... strong.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
We could hear the trees and telephone lines rattling.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I closed my eyes, my elbows resting on the small folding table, and my thoughts skittered out to the row of shops along the now-silent street below.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

.We laughed.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"After that, somehow the conversation strayed off the subject.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Even I, slow as I am, finally understood his excessive unnaturalness.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When I took a good look in his eyes, I understood.He was terribly, terribly sad.Sotaro had said that even though she'd been seeing him for a year, Yuichi's girlfriend didn't understand the slightest thing about him, and it made her angry.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She said Yuichi was incapable of caring more for a girl than he did for a fountain pen.Because I wasn't in love with Yuichi, I understood that very well.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The quality and importance of a fountain pen meant to him something completely different from what it meant to her.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Perhaps there are people in this world who love their fountain pens with every fiber of their being—and that's very sad.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"If you're not in love with him, you can understand him.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""It couldn't be helped,"" said Yuichi without raising his head.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
He seemed bothered by my silence.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""It was in no way your fault.""""Thanks.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
For some reason I was thanking him.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""You're welcome,"" he said, laughing.I've touched him, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"After a month of living in the same place, at close quarters, I've touched him for the 29first time.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"In that case, I might end up falling in love with him.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When I've fallen in love before, I've always tried to run it down and tackle it, but with him it would be different.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The conversation we just had was like a glimpse of stars through a chink in a cloudy sky—perhaps, over time, talks like this would lead to love.But—I was thinking while I wrote—I must move out.It was patendy obvious that the trouble between Yuichi and his girlfriend was my living here.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"As to how strong I was, or whether I would soon be ready to go back to living alone, I couldn't venture a guess.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Still, I told myself, soon, of course, very soon—although telling myself this while writing my change-of-address cards could be considered a contradiction.I had to move out.Just then the door opened with a squeal of hinges, and in came Eriko holding a large paper bag.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I looked at her in surprise.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""What's going on?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"What's happening at the club?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"""I just came home to drop it off.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Go ahead, use it.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"""I hear fresh-squeezed juice gives you beautiful skin,""said Eriko, delighted.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""It's a little late for that at your age,"" retorted Yuichi, not raising his eyes from the instruction booklet.The incredible ease and nonchalance of the conversation made my brain reel.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was like watching Bewitched.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"That they could be this cheerfully normal in the midst of such extreme abnormality.""Oh!""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
cried Eriko.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Is Mikage writing her change-of-address cards?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
This is perfect.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I have a moving-in gift for her.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Then she produced another package, this one wrapped round and round with paper.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When I opened it, I saw that it was a pretty glass decorated with a banana motif.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Be sure to drink lots of juice, okay?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
said Eriko.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Maybe we should drink banana juice,"" said Yuichi with a straight face.""Wow!""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I said, on the verge of tears.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I'm so happy!",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""When I move out I'll take this glass with me, and even after I move out I'll come back again and again to make soupy rice for you.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I was thinking that but wasn't able to say it.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"What a special, special glass!The next day was when I had to clear out of the old apartment for good; at last I got it cleaned out completely.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I was feeling very sluggish.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It was a clear, bright afternoon, windless and cloudless, and a warm, golden 31sunlight filled the empty rooms I had once called home.By way of apology for taking so much time, I went to visit the landlord.Like we often did when I was a child, we drank tea and chatted in his office.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I felt very keenly how old he had become.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Just as my grandmother had often sat here, now I was in the same little chair, drinking tea and talking about the weather and the state of the neighborhood.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was strange; it didn't seem right.An irresistible shift had put the past behind me.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I had recoiled in a daze; all I could do was react weakly.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But it was not I who was doing the shifting—on the contrary.For me everything had been agony.Until only recently, the light that bathed the now-empty apartment had contained the smells of our life there.The kitchen window.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The smiling faces of friends, the fresh greenery of the university campus as a backdrop to Sotaro's profile, my grandmother's voice on the phone when I called her late at night, my warm bed on cold mornings, the sound of my grandmother's slippers in the hallway, the color of the curtains.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.. the tatami mat.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.. the clock on the wall.All of it.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Everything that was no longer there.When I left the apartment it was already evening.Pale twilight was descending.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The wind was coming up, KITCHENa little chilly on the skin.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I waited for the bus, the hem of my thin coat fluttering in the gusts.I watched the rows of windows in the tall building across the street from the bus stop, suspended, emitting a pretty blue light.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The people moving behind those windows, the elevators going up and down, all of it, sparkling silently, seemed to melt into the half-darkness.I carried the last of my things in both hands.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When I thought, now at last I won't be torn between two places, I began to feel strangely shaky, close to tears.The bus appeared around the corner.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It seemed to float to a stop before my eyes, and the people lined up, got on, one by one.It was packed.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I stood, with my hand on the crowded strap, watching the darkening sky disappear beyond the distant buildings.When the bus took off my eye came to rest on the still-new moon making its gentle way across the sky.My angry, irritable reaction to the jarring each time the bus lurched to a stop told me how tired I was.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Again and again, with each angry stop, I would look outside and watch a dirigible drifting across the far-off sky.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Propelled by the wind, it slowly moved along.Staring at it intendy, I felt happy.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The dirigible traversed the sky like a pale moonbeam, its tiny lights blinking on and off.Then an old lady sitting beside her little granddaughter, who was direcdy in front of me, said in a low voice,""Look, Yuki, a dirigible.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Look!,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Look!,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Isn't it beautiful?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""The little girl, whose face epitomized ""grandchild,"" was in a very bad mood, perhaps because of the traffic jam and crowdedness.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She said angrily, fidgeting, ""I don't care.And it's not a dirigible!",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Maybe you're right,"" said the grandmother, smiling brightly, not at all annoyed.Yuki continued her whiny pouting.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"You don't want to wake her, do you, Yuki?""""Oh!",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She is, isn't she?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Turning around to look at her sleeping mother in the back of the bus, Yuki finally smiled.Isn't that nice, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Hearing the grandmother's gentle words and seeing the child's face suddenly turn adorable when she smiled, I became envious.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I'd never see my own grandmother again.Never again.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I don't care for the loaded sentimentality of those words or for the feeling of limitation they impose.But just then they struck me with an unforgettable intensity and authority.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I intended to think them over dispas-sionately.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Josded by the motion of the bus, I was determined to keep that dirigible, so far off in the sky, in sight no matter what.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But then, overpowered by their enormous weight, I found that tears were pouring down my cheeks and onto my blouse.KITCHENI was surprised.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Am I losing my mind?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I wondered.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was like being falling-down drunk: my body was independent of me.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Before I knew it, tears were flooding out.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I felt myself turning bright red with embarrassment and got off the bus.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I watched it drive away, and then without thinking I ducked into a poorly lit alley.Jammed between my own bags, stooped over, I sobbed.I had never cried this way in my life.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"As the hot tears poured out, I remembered that I had never had a proper cry over my grandmother's death.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I had a feeling that I wasn't crying over any one sad thing, but rather for many.Looking up, I saw white steam rising, in the dark, out of a brightly lit window overhead.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I listened.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"From inside came the sound of happy voices at work, soup boiling, knives and pots and pans clanging.It was a kitchen.I was puzzled, smiling about how I had just gone from the darkest despair to feeling wonderful.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I stood up, smoothed down my skirt, and started back for the Tanabes'.I implored the gods: Please, let me live.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I'm sleepy,"" I announced to Yuichi, and went straight to bed.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It had been a prodigiously tiring day.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But still, unburdened after my good cry, I slept like a baby.I had a feeling that I heard, in some part of my brain, Yuichi going into the kitchen for tea and saying, ""What?Are you really already asleep?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""• • •I had a dream.I was scrubbing the sink in the kitchen of the apartment I had cleared out of that day.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"But, in fact, everything had been packed away ages ago.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Then I realized that Yuichi was there, cleaning the floor with a rag.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"The room was so unearthly quiet, I lost all sense of time being divided into seconds.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I felt that I was the only person alive and moving in a world brought to a stop.Houses always feel like that after someone has died.I sank into the sofa and stared blankly at the melancholy early-winter gray outside the large window.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The heavy, cold air of winter permeated every part of this little neighborhood—the park, the walkways—like a fog.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I couldn't bear it.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It oppressed me, and I felt like I couldn't breathe.Truly great people emit a light that warms the hearts of those around them.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When that light has been put out, a heavy shadow of despair descends.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Perhaps Eriko's was only a minor kind of greatness, but her light was sorely missed.I flopped down on my back and looked up at the dear, familiar ceiling.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Right after my grandmother died, I had stared at this same ceiling many an afternoon while Yuichi and Eriko were out.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I remember thinking to myself, my grandmother is dead, I've lost my last blood relation, and things can't get any worse.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But now they had.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Eriko been enormously important to me.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"In the six montl spent together she had always been there for me; she spoiled me.To the extent that I had come to understand that despair does not necessarily result in annihilation, that one can go on as usual in spite of it, I had become hardened.Was that what it means to be an adult, to live with ugly ambiguities?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I didn't like it, but it made it easier to go on.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
My heart was so heavy now because of just that.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I watched the gloomy clouds and the orange of the sunset spreading across them in the western sky.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Soon the cold night would descend and fill the hollow in my heart.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I felt sleepy but said to myself, if you sleep now, you'll have bad dreams.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
So I got up.After a long absence I was once again in the Tanabe kitchen.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"For an instant I had a vision of Eriko's smiling face, and my heart turned over.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I felt an urge to get moving.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It looked to me like the kitchen had not been used in quite a while.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was somewhat dirty and dark.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I began to clean.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I scrubbed the sink with scouring pow-der, wiped off the burners, washed the dishes, sharpened the knives.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I washed and bleached all the dish towels, and while watching them go round and round in the dryer I realized that I had become calmer.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Why do I love everything that has to do with kitchens so much?It's strange.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Perhaps because to me a kitchen represents some distant longing engraved on my soul.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"As I stood there, I seemed to be making a new start; something was coming back.KITCHEN* • •That summer I had taught myself to cook.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The sensation that my brain cells were multiplying was exhilarating.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I bought three books on cooking— funda-mentals, theory, and practice— and went through them one by one.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"On the bus, in bed, on the sofa, I read the one on theory, memorizing caloric content, temperatures, and raw ingredients.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Every spare minute I cooked.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Those three books grew tattered with use, and even now I always have them near at hand.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Like the picture books I loved when I was little, I know the illustrations on each page by heart.Yuichi and Eriko took to saying to each other, ""Mikage has gone completely nuts, hasn't she?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"And it's true that for the whole summer I went about it with a crazed enthusiasm: cooking, cooking, cooking.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I poured all my earnings from my part-time job into it, and if something came out wrong I'd do it over till I got it right.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Angry, fretful, or cheery, I cooked through it all.When I think about it now, it was because of my cooking that the three of us ate together as often as we did; it was a good summer.Looking out the window as the evening wind came through the screen door, a remnant of pale blue stretching over the hot sky, we ate boiled pork, cold Chinese noodles, cucumber salad.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I cooked for them: she who made a fuss over everything I did; he who ate vast quantities in silence.Complicated omelets, beautifully shaped vegetables cooked in broth, tempura—it took a fair amount of work to be able to make those things.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Because my biggest flaw is lack of precision, it didn't occur to me that dishes turn out badly or well in proportion to one's attention to detail.For example, if I put something in the oven before it had come to temperature, or if I got the steam going before I had everything chopped, that sort of triviality (or so I thought) was precisely reflected in the color and shape of the final product.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Which surprised me.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Although that kind of cooking made my dinners no worse than those of the average housewife, they by no means resembled the illustrations in the books.There was only one way to learn: I tried making anything and everything, and I tried to do it right.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I would carefully wipe out the bowls, replace the caps on the spices every time, calmly chart out the steps in advance, and when I began to make myself crazy with irritation I would stop what I was doing and take a few deep breaths.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"At first my impatience would lead me to the brink of despair, but when I finally learned to correct my mistakes coolly, it was truly as if I had somehow reformed my own slapdash character.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Or so I felt (of course, it wasn't true).Getting the job I have now, as an assistant to a cooking teacher, was incredible.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She not only teaches cooking classes, but also gets a lot of important television and magazine work, and she is actually rather famous.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
An amazing number of candidates apparently tested for the job.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Why was it that I—a novice with only one summer of study under my belt—got hired?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When I saw the women who KITCHENattend the classes, it made sense.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Their attitude was completely different from mine.Those women lived their lives happily.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"They had been taught, probably by caring parents, not to exceed the boundaries of their happiness regardless of what they were doing.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But therefore they could never know real joy.Which is better?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Who can say?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Everyone lives the way she knows best.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"What I mean by ""their happiness"" is living a life untouched as much as possible by the knowledge that we are really, all of us, alone.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"That's not a bad thing.Dressed in their aprons, their smiling faces like flowers, learning to cook, absorbed in their little troubles and per-plexities, they fall in love and marry.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I think that's great.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I wouldn't mind that kind of life.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Me, when I'm utterly exhausted by it all, when my skin breaks out, on those lonely evenings when I call my friends again and again and nobody's home, then I despise my own life—my birth, my upbringing, everything.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I feel only regret for the whole thing.But—that one summer of bliss.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
In that kitchen.I was not afraid of burns or scars; I didn't suffer from sleepless nights.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Every day I thrilled with pleasure at the challenges tomorrow would bring.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Memorizing the recipe, I would make carrot cakes that included a bit of my soul.At the supermarket I would stare at a bright red tomato, loving it for dear life.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Having known such joy, there was no going back.No matter what, I want to continue living with the awareness that I will die.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Without that, I am not alive.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"T1is what makes the life I have now possible, v/Inching one's way along a steep cliff in the dark: on reaching the highway, one breathes a sigh of relief.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Just when one can't take any more, one sees the moonlight.Beauty that seems to infuse itself into the heart: I know about that./It was evening by the time I'd finished cleaning up and preparing for dinner.Yuichi rang the doorbell and, carrying a large plastic bag in his arms, pushed the door open with a great show of difficulty and stuck his head inside.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I walked toward him.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Unbelievable,"" he said, putting down his burden with a thud.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""What is?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""I bought everything you said to, but I can't carry it all in one trip.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
There's too much.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Oh,"" I said, pretending not to catch on, but Yuichi's snort of irritation let me know there was no getting out of it.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I went down with him to the garage.In the car were two more gigantic bags.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Even carrying them from the car to the garage entrance was back-breaking.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I bought a few things for myself, too,"" said Yuichi, carrying the heavier of the two.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

Yuichi pointed to the winter moon with his chin.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Oh, isn't it,"" I said sarcastically (his diversionary tactics were so obvious), but as I stepped into the building I turned to glance at it.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It was almost full and shed an incredible brightness.In the elevator on the way up, Yuichi said, ""Of course there's a relationship.!",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"'""Between what?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"""A moment before, my heart had seemed to stop.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Now that feeling voiced itself in my mind: If Yuichi is with me, 6*I need nothing else.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It flashed for only an instant, but it left me extremely confused, dazzled as I was by the light given off by his eyes.It took me two hours to make dinner.Yuichi peeled potatoes and watched TV while I cooked.He had very nimble fingers.For me, Eriko's death was still a distant event.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I couldn't deal with it head-on.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Faced with a tempest of shock, I could only approach the dark fact of her death little by little.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"And Yuichi—Yuichi was like a willow beaten down by the driving rain.So even though it was now just the two of us, we avoided talking about Eriko's death, and that omission loomed larger and larger in time and space.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But for the time being, ""just the two of us"" was a warm, safe place where the future was on hold.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"And yet there was—how should I put this?—a huge, terrifying premonition that those unpaid bills would inexorably come due.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The enormity of it only heightened our feeling of being orphans alone in the dark.The limpid night descended, and we began to eat the extravagant dinner I had prepared.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"It was an international hodge-podge, but we ate it all (it took hours), with wine, until we couldn't face another bite.Yuichi, uncharacteristically, was very drunk.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Just as I 62KITCHENwas thinking that it was odd—I didn't see him have that much at dinner—I noticed, with a start, an empty bottle on the floor.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Apparently he had been at it while I was cooking; no wonder he was three sheets to the wind.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

I couldn't destroy Yuichi's picture of us starving together.At that moment I had a thrillingly sharp intuition.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"Now I felt really alone, at the bottom of a deep loneliness that no one could touch.People aren't overcome by situations or outside forces; defeat invades from within, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

I took out my gloves and put them on.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I climbed the hill in the moonlight, the katsudon in my backpack.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I had an uneasy premonition and it didn't prove wrong.The inn where Yuichi was staying was not the old-fash-ioned kind, which would have been easy to get into in the middle of the night.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"At the front entrance the automatic glass door was securely locked, as was the emergency exit at the bottom of the outer stairs.I walked back down the path to call the inn, but no one answered.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
That was reasonable.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It was midnight, after all.I felt puzzled as I stood before the darkened building: What on earth am I doing all the way out here?Then, unwilling to give up, I walked around to the back, inching my way along a tiny path next to the emergency exit.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Just as Yuichi had said, from the garden you could see the waterfall, and each room faced the garden, which was no doubt a selling point.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But every window was dark.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I sighed, contemplating the situation.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"A railing ran along the cliff, and the high, thin stream kept up a steady sound of falling water against the mossy rocks below.White flecks of cold-looking spray gleamed in the dark.The whole waterfall was illuminated here and there by amazingly bright green lights that brought the trees into almost unnatural relief.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The scene reminded me of the 95Jungle Cruise at Disneyland.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Thinking, what a fake-looking green, I turned around and once more gazed up at the row of darkened windows.Just then, somehow, I knew.The room in the near comer, the window reflecting green light—that was Yuichi's.I felt at any moment I would be peering through that window.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I began to climb up a pile of garden stones against the wall.Looking up, I saw the edge of an ornamental ledge that ran around the building between the first and second floors.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It occurred to me that I could just reach it on tiptoe.Carefully gauging the stability of the haphazardly stacked pile of stones, I took a second step, then a third, and I got even nearer.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Facing a pair of shutters, I tentatively stretched out a hand.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I just barely got a grip.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Determined, I jumped and managed to cling fast to a shutter with one hand.Making a supreme effort, I was able to launch the other hand over the top of the ornamental ledge and h^ld onto the tile with all my strength.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Suddenly, as I hung there, pressed vertically against the side of the building, what few athletic skills I had seemed to leave me with an audible sssshhhhh.Still holding fast to the tile at the jutting edge of the ornamental ledge, stretched to the maximum, I found myself in a fix.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"My arms were numb with cold, and my backpack was working itself off one shoulder and down my arm.Look at you, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Thanks to a sudden whim, here you are hanging from a roof, panting white puffs of breath.You've really outdone yourself this time.96KITCHENThe stones I had climbed up on seemed to loom dark and far away.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The roaring of the waterfall reverberated desperately.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I had no choice: I gave it everything I had and pulled myself up, dangling from the ledge.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I lifted the top half ofmy body up and over, kicking off the wall with grim determination.I heard a ripping sound, and a searing pain shot up my right arm.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I managed to roll myself onto the roof on all fours.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"My legs made a splashing noise as I lolled in a filthy pool of what must have been rain water.Still lying down, but having reached a haven, I looked at my arm.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was covered in red from the bleeding wound.It made me dizzy to look at it.I shrugged off my pack.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Lying there on my back, I looked up at the roof of the inn and, staring at the glowing moon and clouds, I thought, really, we're all in the same position.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"(It occurred to me that I had often thought that in similar situations, in moments of utter desperation.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I would like to be known as an action philosopher.),Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
We all believe we can choose our own path from among the many alternatives.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But perhaps it's more accurate to say that we make the choice unconsciously.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I think I did—but now I knew it, because now I was able to put it into words.But I don't mean this in the fatalistic sense; we're con-standy making choices.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"With the breaths we take every day, with the expression in our eyes, with the daily actions we do over and over, we decide as though by instinct.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"And so some of us will inevitably find ourselves rolling around in a puddle on some roof in a strange place with a takeout katsudon in the middle of winter, looking up at the night sky, as if it were the most natural thing in the world Ah, but the moon was lovely.I stood up and knocked on Yuichi's window.I waited for a response for what seemed like a pretty long time.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"""I took it from my backpack.The fluorescent light shone on the new green tatami mat.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"he said laughing, and—although it wasn't the most creative gift-took it from my palm and wrapped it carefully in his handkerchief as if it were something precious.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"He surprised me: it was not typical behavior for a boy that age.As it turns out, it was love.Whether he did it because the gift was from me or because that was how he was raised, not to treat a gift carelessly, it amazed me and made me warm to him.There was electric charge between our hearts, and its conduit was the sound of the bell.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The whole time we spent apart on that class trip, we each had the bell on our minds.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Whenever he heard it ring, he would remember me and the time we had spent together; I passed the trip imagining I could hear the bell across the vast sky, imagining the person who had it in his possession.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"After we got back, we fell deeply in love.For nearly four years the bell was always with us.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Each and every afternoon and evening, in each and every thing we did—our first kiss, our big fights, rain and shine and snow, the first night we spent together, every smile and every tear, listening to music and watching TV—whenever Hitoshi took out that case, which he used as a wallet,•we heard its faint, clear tinkling sound.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It seemed as though I could hear it even when he wasn't there.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
You might say it was just a young girl's sentimentality.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But I did think I heard it—that's how it felt to me then.There was one thing that always disturbed me profoundly.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Sometimes, no matter how intently I would be staring at him, I would have the feeling that Hitoshi wasn't there.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"So many times, when he was asleep, I felt the need to put my ear to his heart.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"No matter how bright his smile, I would have to strain my eyes to see him.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"His facial expressions, the atmosphere around him, always had a kind of transparency.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The whole time I was with him there was that feeling of ephemerality, uncertainty.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"If that was a premonition of what was to come, what a sorrowful one it was.A lover should die after a long lifetime.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I lost Hitoshi at the age of twenty, and I suffered from it so much that I felt as if my own life had stopped.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The night he died, my soul went away to some other place and I couldn't bring it back.It was impossible to see the world as I had before.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"My brain ebbed and flowed, unstable, and I passed the days in a relendess state of dull oppression.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I felt that I was feted to undergo one of those things it's better not to have to experience even once in a lifetime (abortion, prostitution, major illness).After all, we were still young, and who knows whether it would have been our last love?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
We had overcome many first hurdles together.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"We came to know what it is to be deeply tied to someone and we learned to judge for ourselves the weight of many kinds of events—from these things, one by one, we constructed our four years.Now that it's over, I can shout it out: The gods are assholes!",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I loved Hitoshi—I loved Hitoshi more than life itself.• • •For two months after Hitoshi died, every morning found me leaning over the railing of the bridge on the river drinking hot tea.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I had begun to go jogging every day at dawn, since I slept very badly, and that point on the bridge was where I rested before the run back home.Sleeping at night was what I feared most.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
No—worse than that was the shock of awakening.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I dreaded the deep gloom that would fall when I remembered he was gone.My dreams were always about Hitoshi.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"After my painful, fitful sleep, whether or not I had been able to see him, on awakening I would know it had been only a dream—in reality I would never be with him again.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
And so I tried not to wake up.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Going back to sleep was no answer: depressed to the point of nausea, I would toss around in a cold sweat.Through my curtains I would see the sky getting lighter, blue-white, and I would feel abandoned in the chill and silence of dawn.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It was so forlorn and cold, I wished I could be back in the dream.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"There I would be, wide-eyed, tortured by its lingering memory.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was always then that I truly woke up.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Finally, exhausted from lack of sleep, beginning to panic at the prospect of that lonely time—like a bout of insanity—in which I would wait for the first morning light, I decided to take up running.I bought myself an expensive two-piece sweatsuit, running shoes, and even a small aluminum container in which to carry a hot drink.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I thought, ironically, that beginners always over-equip—but still, it was best to look ahead.I began running just before spring vacation.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I would run m^M*•:MOONLIGHT SHADOWto the bridge, turn around, and head home, where I would carefully wash out my neck towel and sweaty clothes.While they were in the dryer I would help my mother make breakfast.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Then I'd go back to bed for a while.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
That was my life.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"In the evenings I'd get together with friends, watch videos, whatever, anything to leave myself as litde free time as possible.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But the struggle was fruidess.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
There was only one thing I had any desire to do: I wanted to see Hitoshi.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Yet at all costs I had to keep my hands and body and mind moving.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Doing that, I hoped, albeit listlessly, would somehow, someday, lead to a breakthrough.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"There was no guarantee, but I would try to endure, no matter what, until it came.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When my dog died, when my bird died, I had gotten through in more or less the same way.But it was different this time.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Without a prospect in sight, day after day went by, like losing one's mind bit by bit.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I would repeat to myself, like a prayer: It's all right, it's all right, the day will come when you'll pull out of this.The river, spanned by a white bridge, was wide, and divided our part of the city almost exacdy in half.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It took me about twenty minutes to reach it.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I loved that place—it was there that I used to meet Hitoshi, who had lived on the other side of the river.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Even after he died I still loved the place.On the deserted bridge, with the city misted over by the blue haze of dawn, my eyes absendy followed the white embankment that continued on to who knows where.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I rested, enveloped in the sound of the current, leisurely drinking hot tea.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Standing there in the clear air that tingled with cold, I felt just the tiniest bit close to death myself.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was only in the severe clarity of that horribly lonely place that I could feel at ease.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
My self-torture stopped when I was there.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Without this respite I would never have been able to get through the days.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I was pierced by how much I needed it.That morning I awoke with a start from a vicious nightmare.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was five-thirty.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
In the dawn of what promised to be a clear day I dressed and went out as usual.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was still dark; not a soul was out.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The air was bitingly cold, the streets misty white, the sky a deep navy blue.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Rich grada-tions of red were coming up in the east.I had to force myself to run.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"My breath was labored; the notion that running this much on not enough sleep was only tormenting my body passed through my mind, but I ignored it: I can sleep when I get home, I thought in my befuddled brain.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The streets were so utterly quiet that I struggled to remain fully conscious.The sound of the current grew louder as I approached the river; the colors in the sky were changing moment by moment.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I was leaning over the railing the way I always did upon reaching the bridge, absently looking at the rows of buildings on the street, which hung in a faint mist, as if submerged in an ocean of blue air.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The river was roaring, sweeping along anything and everything in its way on a stream of white foam.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The wind it gave off blew cold and seemed to suck the perspiration from my face.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
A half-MOONLIGHT SHADOWm6on shone serenely in the still-brisk March sky.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
My breath came out in puffs of white.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I took the cap off my aluminum bcfttle and poured out some tea, still looking out over the river.Just then I suddenly heard a voice from behind me pipe up, ""What kind of tea is that?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Could I have some?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It startled me—so much so that I dropped the bottle in the river.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I still had a full cup of steaming tea in one hand.Imagining god knows what, I turned around, and there stood a young woman with a smile on her face.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I knew she was older than me, but for some reason I couldn't guess her age.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Maybe about twenty-five .,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She had short hair and very clear, large eyes.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She wore a thin white coat, but seemed not to feel the cold in the least.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She had popped up before I had a clue that anyone was there behind me.Then, looking cheerful, she said in a slighdy nasal but sweet voice, ""It's just like that Brothers Grimm story about the dog, isn't it?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Or was that Aesop?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
She laughed.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""In that instance,"" I said coolly, ""the dog dropped his bone when he saw his own reflection in the water.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"""""Thank you,"" I said, showing her a smile in return.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She spoke so calmly that I was not afraid of her, and she wasn't attempting familiarities.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She didn't seem crazy, nor did she look like a drunk on her way home at dawn.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Her eyes were too knowing and serene; the expression on her face hinted that she had tasted deeply of the sorrows and joys of this world.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The air around her seemed somehow charged.After taking one sip to wet my throat, I offered her the cup.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Here, have the rest.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It's Pu-Arh tea.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Oh, I love that,"" she said, taking the cup with a slender hand.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"Her eyes had the bright sparkle of a traveler's.""Sightseeing?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I asked, wondering what could have brought her to this particular place.""Yes.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Soon, on this spot, there'll be something to see that only happens every hundred years.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

",""Something to see?""""Yes.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"""""I can't tell you yet.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But I promise I will, because you shared your tea with me.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She laughed as she said it, and I almost failed to catch that last part.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The mood of approaching morning seemed to fill the whole world.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The rays of the rising sun spread over the blue sky, illuminating the faintly sparkling layers of air with white light.It was time to be getting back, so I said, ""Well, good-bye.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
At that she looked me direcdy in the eye with that same bright expression.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""My name is Urara,"" she said.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""What's yours?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Satsuki,"" I answered.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Let's get together again,"" said Urara, waving good-bye.I waved back and started running home.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
She was an odd one.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I had no idea what she was talking about, but somehow I knew that she was someone who did not live like MOONLIGHT SHADOWother people.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"With each step I took I grew more uneasy, and I couldn't help but turn and look back.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Urara was still on the bridge.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I saw her face in profile as she watched the river.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It shocked me—it was not that of the person I had just talked with.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I had never seen such a severe expression on anyone.She noticed me standing there, smiled brighdy again, and waved.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Flustered, I returned her wave and broke into a run.In heaven's name, what kind of person was she?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I pondered it for quite some time.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"More and more, that morning in the sunlight, the impression of that mysterious Urara carved itself with baroque fdigree into my sleepy brain.Hitoshi had an extremely eccentric younger brother.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"His way of thinking, his responses to events, were ""curioser and curioser.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"He lived exactly as if his awareness of things had been formed in some other dimension, after which he was plopped down on this planet to fend for himself.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"That was my first impression of him, and I stick by it.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
His name was Hiiragi.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"He was to turn eighteen this month.Hiiragi and I had arranged to meet, after he got out of school, in a coffee shop on the fourth floor of a department store.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"In he came, wearing a sailor-style girl's high school uniform, complete with middy blouse and skirt.The truth is I was mortified, but he acted so natural that U?banana y o s h i m o t oI managed to feign calmness.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Sitting down across from me he asked, breathless, ""Were you waiting long?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
When I shook my head he smiled brightly.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"After he had ordered the waitress stared him up and down and muttered, ""Yes sir,"" mystified.He didn't look much like Hitoshi, but sometimes the way his face and fingers moved would remind me so much of his brother that my heart would stop.""Oh!""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I said, purposely giving voice to my surprise, as I always did when he reminded me of Hitoshi.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was part of a ritual between us.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"he said, looking at me, cup in hand.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""You .",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"you reminded me of him, just then,"" I said.Then, according to our ritual, he said, ""I'll do Hitoshi,""and imitated his brother.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
We both laughed.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"That was the only way the two of us had to make light of the wounds in our hearts.I'd lost my boyfriend, but he had lost both brother and girlfriend at once.His girlfriend, Yumiko, had been a small, pretty girl his own age, and a tennis ace.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The four of us were close in age, got along well, and had often hung out together.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I would go over to Hitoshi's house and Yumiko would be there with Hiiragi—I couldn't count how many times the four of us stayed up all night, playing games.The night it happened, Hitoshi was giving Yumiko a ride from his house, where she'd been visiting Hiiragi, to the train station.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

It wasn't his fault.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Still, the two of them were killed instantly.MOONLIGHT SHADOW• • •""So, you're jogging?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"""Although Hitoshi and Hiiragi had been very different from each other, they were both just naturally kind in a way that was without affectation or ulterior motives.That's how they were raised.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The sort of kindness that makes a person wrap a bell in a handkerchief.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I'd love to,"" I said.The girl's school uniform Hiiragi was wearing had been Yumiko's.After she died he had started wearing it to school, though he went to one where uniforms were not required.Yumiko had liked to wear the uniform.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

His sailor outfit—my jogging.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
They served exactly the same purpose.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I wasn't as eccentric as him, so I was satisfied with mere jogging.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Because nothing so conventional would do for Hiiragi, he chose the sailor outfit, as a variation.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Neither recourse was anything more than a way of trying to lend some life to a shriveled spirit.It was a way to divert our minds, to kill time.Both Hiiragi and I, in the last two months, had unconsciously assumed facial expressions we had never worn before, expressions that showed how we were battling not to think of what we had lost.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"If, in a flash, we remembered, we would suddenly be crushed with the knowledge, the knowledge of our loss, and find ourselves standing alone in the darkness.I got up.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

The windows of the white school building reflected the darkening dead-of-winter sky.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I remember climbing step by step in my black shoes and knee socks; the swish, swish of the skirt of my school uniform.Outside, the night was filled with the scent of spring.Hiiragi's sailor-style uniform was hidden under his coat, which was a relief to me.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The light given off by the department-store windows shone white on the faces of the bustling crowd.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"In spite of the sweet smell of spring on the wind, it was still cold.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

He had interpreted my silence as worrying about how I'd get home.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""No, no, that's no problem.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It's still early,"" I said, confused, thinking, you ... you reminded me of him just then, although this time I didn't say it.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"At that moment he was so like Hitoshi there was no need to ask Hiiragi to do him.A kindness spoken out of reflex, at once impersonal and generous, but by no means bridging the distance established between two people—it always produces in me that sense of transparency, that deeply moving emotion I was being reminded of right then.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
An unbearable sense of loss.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""The other day,"" I said as we set off, ""one morning when I was jogging, I met a strange person on the bridge.I was just remembering that.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

It was unforgettable.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I felt that my own pain and sadness had never even come close to hers.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Perhaps there was still much worse in store for me.We came to a large intersection.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Both Hiiragi and I felt a little ill at ease; this was the scene of the accident.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"But I felt I understood it now.This intersection, the colors of these buildings, and rows of shops in the darkness were Hitoshi's last sights.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
And it wasn't all that long ago.How afraid was he?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

I heard little puffs of laughter.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I just say to myself, 'I must get this phone number,' and it just naturally comes to me,"" Urara said, as if reciting a spell.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"What motivated me was probably that litde light still left in my half-dead heart, glittering in the darkness.Yet without it, perhaps, I might have slept better.I bundled up in warm clothing and got on my bike.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was a noon enveloped in warm sunlight—it made you think that spring would truly come.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"A light wind was blowing, soft and gende on the face.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The trees on the street were beginning to sprout their tiny infant leaves.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
A thin veil of mist hung distantly in the pale blue sky far beyond the city.Such blossoming delegability did not make my own insides flutter; it left me unmoved.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

The tinkle of the bell disappeared into the night.Hitoshi and I both cherished that sound.We had horrible fights and we both had our little outside flings.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
We suffered from the changing balance between love and desire.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

So it isn't that we were always as happy as we were that day; our times together were often painful.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Still, it was a good four years, and that day was an unusually perfect one for us, so much so as to make us fearful it would end.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"It would be enough for me.That was what I was thinking as I walked along, holding my thermos.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"On the way to get my bike where I'd left it at the station, I spotted Hiiragi.There he was, in the middle of the street, wearing his regular clothes.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"He must be skipping school, I thought, which made me smile.It wasn't that I was hesitant to run up to him and call his name—it was just that because of my fever I couldn't muster the energy, so all I did was walk toward him without changing my pace.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Just then he set off in the direction I was going anyway, so quite naturally I followed him up the street.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

I knew that.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

Or maybe it was just that I was terribly tired.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Nothing could enter directly into my heart.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"All I wanted was to get through this as quickly as possible, to see the day when memories would be just memories.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But the more I wanted that, the further away it seemed.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Thinking of the future only made me shudder.Then Hiiragi suddenly stopped, and I automatically stopped, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Now you really are trailing him, I said to myself, smiling.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I took a step toward him and was about to call out—then I realized what he was looking at and froze in my tracks.He was staring into the window of a tennis shop.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
How well I understood the blank look on his face as he peered MOONLIGHT SHADOWinto that window.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"He seemed to be feeling nothing at all.But in that very lack of expression, the profundity of what he was doing was transmitted nonetheless.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It's like unconscious conditioning, I thought, like a baby duck trailing after some moving object, taking it for its mother.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Though the baby duck is unaware of it, it's very touching for the observer.That's how I felt, watching Hiiragi.In the spring light he stood among the crowd, staring, staring detachedly into that window.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The sight of all that tennis equipment must have had a powerful effect on him.It did the same thing for Hiiragi that being with him did for me: thanks to the trace of Hitoshi in him, his very presence calmed me.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I thought how sad that was.I myself saw one of Yumiko's tennis matches.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The first time I met her I thought she was cute, all right, but she struck me as a bit average, rather overly cheerful, not too deep, and I couldn't imagine what Hiiragi saw in her that bewitched him so.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"With Yumiko, Hiiragi was in a dream.On the surface he was the same old Hiiragi, but something in her quieted his spirit.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"In real strength, she was his match.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""What is it about her?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I asked Hitoshi one time.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Apparendy it's tennis,"" he said, smiling.""Tennis?""""Yes.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"According to Hiiragi, she's incredible.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""It was summer.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"Still, after the deciding shot, the instant she'd won, she turned to Hiiragi with her old baby-faced smile.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It was impressive.The four of us had a lot of fun together, and I liked her very much.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She'd say to me, ""Satsuki, let's the four of us always hang out together, don't you two ever break up.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Teasing, I would smile and say, ""Well, it won't be us.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She would laugh and say, ""Well, it won't be us either!",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

It's too horrible.I doubted if he was recalling her at this moment like I was.Boys don't go out of their way to feel pain.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But still, his eyes, his whole person, were saying one thing only.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
He himself would never speak it.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"At the very least, I wanted to say a proper good-bye.I knew I wouldn't tell Hiiragi what I'd seen today.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I re-solved to speak up cheerfully the next time, but for now I left without calling to him.With all that activity, my fever went up.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It makes sense, I thought; it simply follows that if one goes ginning around town in the condition I was in, delirious, this would be the result.My mother laughed and asked me if it might not be like a teething fever.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Weakly, I laughed back.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But in a sense I think it was.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Perhaps my unproductive thoughts had spread like poison throughout my body.That night, as usual, I awoke from a dream of Hitoshi.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I dreamed that in spite of my fever I had run to the river and Hitoshi was there.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"He said to me, smiling, ""You've got a cold; what are you doing?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"That was the lowest point yet.When I opened my eyes it was dawn, time to get up and get dressed.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But it was cold, so very cold, and in spite of the fact that my whole body felt flushed, my hands and feet were like ice.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I had the chills; I shuddered, my whole body in pain.I opened my eyes, trembling in the half-darkness.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I felt I was battling something absurdly enormous.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Then, from t deep within, I began to wonder if I mightn't lose.It hurt to have lost Hitoshi.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"It hurt too much.When we were in each other's arms, I knew something that was beyond words.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was the mystery of being close to someone who is not family.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"My heart dropped out, and I was feeling what people fear the most; I touched the deepest despair a person can know.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I was lonely.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Hideously lonely.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
This was the worst.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"If I could get through this, morning would come, and I knew without a doubt that I would have fun again, laugh out loud.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
If only the sun would rise.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"If only morning would come.Whenever it had been like this before, I had set my teeth and stood up to it; but now, lacking the strength to go to the river, I could only suffer.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Time inched along, as if I were walking on shards of glass.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I felt that if I could only get to the river, Hitoshi really would be there.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I felt insane.I was sick at heart.I sluggishly got up and went to the kitchen for some tea.My throat was parched.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Because of my fever, the whole house looked surreally warped, distorted; the kitchen was ice-cold and dark.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Everyone was asleep.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Delirious, I made tea and went back to my room.The tea seemed to help.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It soothed my dry throat and my breathing became natural again.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I sat up in bed and parted the curtains.From my room I had a good view of the front gate and yard.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The trees and flowers rusded, trembling in the blue morning air—they seemed painted in flat colors, like a diorama in a museum.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was pretty.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
These days I was well MOONLIGHT SHADOWaware of how the blue air of dawn makes everything seem purified.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"As I sat there peering out the window, I saw the shadow of a person coming up the sidewalk in front of my house.I wondered if it was a dream and blinked my eyes.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was Urara.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Dressed in blue, grinning broadly, she looked at me and came toward me.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"At the gate she mouthed, ""May I come in?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I nodded.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
She crossed the yard and reached my window.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I opened it, my heart pounding.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Sure is cold out,"" she said.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"An icy wind came in through the window, freezing my feverish cheeks.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The pure, clean air tasted delicious.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""What's up?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I asked.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I must have been beaming like a happy little kid.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"Your cold is looking worse, you know.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Here, I'll give you some vitamin C candy.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Taking the candy from her pocket, she handed it to me, smiling artlessly.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""You're always so good to me,"" I said in a hoarse voice.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""You look like your temperature is very high.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
You must feel rotten.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""""Yes,"" I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I couldn't go running this morning.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
For some reason I felt like crying.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""With a cold""—she spoke evenly, lowering her eyes a litde—""now is the hardest time.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Maybe even harder than dying.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But this is probably as bad as it can get.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"You might come to fear the next time you get a cold; it will be as bad as this, but if you just hold steady, it won't be.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
For the rest of your life.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
That's how it works.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
You could take the negative view and live in fear: Will it happen again?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But it 139banana y o s h i m o t owon't hurt so much if you just accept it as a part of life ""With that she looked up at me, smiling.I remained silent, my eyes wide.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Was she only talking about having a cold?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Just what was she saying?,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The blue of the dawn, my fever, everything was spinning, and the boundary between dream and waking blurred.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"While her words were making their way into my heart, I was staring absently at her bangs, which were fluttering in the wind.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Well, see you tomorrow.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"With a smile, Urara gently shut the window from the outside.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"She skipped lightly out the gate.Floating in a dream, I watched her walk away.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
That she had come to me at the end of a long night of misery made me want to cry tears of joy.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I wanted to tell her: ""How happy I am that you came to me like an apparition in that bluish mist.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Now everything around me will be a little bit better when I wake up.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
At last I was able to fall asleep.When I awoke I knew that my cold was at least a little better.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I slept so soundly that it was evening before I woke up.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I got out of bed, took a shower, put on a fresh change of clothes, started drying my hair.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"My fever was down and I felt quite well, except for the sensation of my body having been through the mill.I wondered, under the hot wind of the hair dryer, if Urara had really come to see me.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Maybe it was just a dream—her words resounded in my brain as if it had been.And had she really only been talking about having a cold?My face in the mirror had a touch of dark shadow on it, 140MOONLIGHT SHADOWmaking me wonder—was this a harbinger of other terrible nights to come, like the aftershocks following an earth-quake?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I was so tired that I couldn't bear to think about it.I was truly exhausted.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
But still .,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"more than anything, I wanted to evade those thoughts, even if I had to do it on my hands and knees.For one thing, I was breathing more easily than I had been even yesterday.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I was sick to death at the prospect of more suffocatingly lonely nights.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The idea that they would be repeated, that that was just how life was, made me shudder with horror.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Still, having tasted for myself that moment when I suddenly could breathe easy again made my heart beat faster.I found I was able to smile a litde.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
The knowledge of how quickly my fever had dissipated made me a litde giddy.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Just then there was an unexpected knock at my bedroom door.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I thought it was my mother and said,""Come in.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When the door opened, I was amazed to see Hiiragi.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""Your mother says she kept calling you, but you didn't answer,"" he said.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I was drying my hair, I guess I couldn't hear.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I was embarrassed to be caught in the intimacy of my room with just-washed, unstyled hair, but he said, nonplussed,""When I phoned, your mother said you had a cold, like a terrible teething fever, so I thought I'd come and see how you're doing.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I remembered that he'd been here with Hitoshi, like the day of the festival and that time after the baseball game.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"So, just like old times, he grabbed a cushion and flopped down.HIIt was only I who had forgotten how well we knew each other.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I brought you a get-well present.""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
Hiiragi laughed indicating a large paper bag.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
At this point I couldn't tell him I was actually just about over it.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I even forced a cough.He had come all this way because he thought I was sick.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""It's a chicken filet sandwich from Kentucky Fried, which I know you love, and some sherbet.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Cokes, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"And, I brought enough for myself, so let's eat.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""He was treating me like I was made of brittle glass.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
My mother must have said something to him.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I was embarrassed.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Still, it wasn't as if I were so much better I could say flat out, ""I'm completely well!",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""In the brightly lit room, warmed by my little heater, the two of us calmly ate what he had brought.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"The food was delicious, and I realized how very, very hungry I was.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It occurred to me I always enjoyed what I ate when I was with him.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"How wonderful that is, I thought.""Satsuki.""""What?""",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"In a reverie, realizing he had said my name, I looked up.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""You've got to stop torturing yourself, all alone, getting thinner and thinner—you even got a fever from it.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"When you feel like that, call me up.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"We'll get together, go do something.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Every time I see you you look more frail, but you pretend everything's all right.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
That's a waste of energy.I know you and Hitoshi were so happy together that now you could die of sadness.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It's only natural.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""He had never said anything like that.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
It was odd—that was the first time I had seen him express such emotion: MOONLIGHT SHADOWsympathy as open and unguarded as a child's.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Because I had thought his style too cool for that, it was totally unexpected, this purehearted concern.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But then I remembered Hitoshi saying how Hiiragi, usually old beyond his years, reverted to a childlike state where the family was concerned.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I had to smile—I felt I understood now what Hitoshi had meant.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"""I know I'm still a kid, and when I take off the sailor outfit I feel so alone I could cry, but we're all brothers and sisters when we're in trouble, aren't we?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"Although my health was not quite back to normal, I got dressed and went running.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"There was no question, it was Hitoshi's.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"Then I opened them, and when I looked across the river I felt crazier than I had in the whole last two months.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I just barely managed to keep from crying out.There was Hitoshi.Across the river, if this wasn't a dream, and I wasn't crazy, the figure facing me was Hitoshi.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Separated from him by the water, my chest welling up, I focused my eyes on that form, the very image of the memory I kept in my heart.Through the blue haze, he was looking in my direction.He had that worried expression he always had when I acted recklessly.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"His hands in his pockets, his eyes found mine.The years I had spent in his arms seemed both very near and very far away.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
We simply gazed at each other.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Only the fading moon saw the too-violent current, the too-distant chasm between us.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"My hair, the collar of Hitoshi's dear, familiar shirt fluttered in the wind off the river as softly as in a dream.Hitoshi, do you want to talk to me?",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I want to talk to you.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"I want to run to your side, take you in my arms, and rejoice in being together again.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"But, but—the tears 145flowed—fate has decided that you and I be so clearly divided like this, facing each other across the river, and I don't have a say in it.My tears fell like rain; all I could do was stare at him.Hitoshi looked sadly back at me.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
I wished time could stop—but with the first rays of the rising sun everything slowly began to fade away.,Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"I, too, waved.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen
"Dear, much-missed Hitoshi—I tried to burn the line of his dear shoulders, his dear arms, all of him, into my brain.",Banana Yoshimoto,Kitchen

"The first time Nakajima stayed over, I dreamed of my dead mom.Maybe it was having him in the room that did it, after having been alone so long.I hadn’t slept next to anyone since my dad and I stayed in my mom’s hospital room.I kept waking up and then, relieved that she hadn’t stopped breathing, going back to sleep.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The floor was dustier than you’d expect in a hospital, and I lay staring at a ball of lint that was always in exactly the same place.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t sleep well, and whenever I drifted into wakefulness I would hear the footsteps of nurses moving down the hallway.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And it occurred to me that I was surrounded by people who could die at any minute, and in some odd way their presence made me feel more at ease here, in the hospital, than I did outside.When things get really bad, you take comfort in the placeness of a place.I hadn’t dreamed of my mom since she died.Or rather, sometimes she would appear in disconnected fragments of dream as I drifted off to sleep, but until that night she had never been there so clearly or for so long.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Somehow I had the feeling, when I awoke, that I had been with her again, for real, after a very long separation.That’s an odd thing to say about someone who’s dead, but that’s how it felt.You could almost say my mom had two different faces.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Two selves that came and went inside her, went and came, like distinct personalities.One was sociable and upbeat, a woman of the world who lived in the moment and seemed like a really cool person to be around; the other was extremely delicate, like a big, soft flower nodding gently on its stem, looking as if the slightest breeze would scatter its petals.The flowerlike side wasn’t easy to recognize, and my mom, always eager to please, tried hard to cultivate the feisty, easygoing side of her personality.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Watering it, rather than the flower, with lots of love, fertilizing it with people’s approval.My mom wasn’t married to my dad when she had me.My dad was the president of a small import-export company in a large town on the outskirts of Tokyo, and my mom was the reasonably beautiful owner, the “Mama-san,” of a ritzy club in the entertainment district of that same town.One night, a business associate invited my dad out drinking and took him to my mom’s club.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
My dad fell for my mom the moment he set eyes on her.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She had a good feeling about him, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When it came time to close up shop, they went to a Korean restaurant and ordered all sorts of dishes, laughing like crazy and having a ball, sharing their food like old friends.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"My dad went back to the club the next night, and the next, and so on, even when it had snowed—he went so often that in two months they were a couple.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Considering how they met, two months seems like a pretty long time.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s what makes it seem like the real thing.They always gave the same answer when I asked what made them laugh so hard.“Because it was a restaurant with no Japanese customers, just a place we’d stumbled across, wandering around in the middle of the night.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And since we couldn’t read the menu, we ended up ordering a whole bunch of things at random, and the waiter kept carting out one dish after another, foods we didn’t recognize at all, some of them incredibly spicy, and the portions were much bigger than we had expected … it was hilarious.”I don’t buy it, though.I think they were just so happy to be sitting across the table from each other that night that the excitement made them giddy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m sure they had to endure all kinds of social pressure, but in front of me they were always very sweet to each other.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They used to quarrel all the time, it’s true, but even that was kind of cute—like little kids having an argument.My mom really wanted a baby, and she got pregnant with me immediately; but even then my parents never officially married.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It wasn’t the usual story, though.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"My dad didn’t already have a wife and family, and he doesn’t have anyone else now.His relatives were the problem.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They were dead set against the union, and my dad didn’t want to drag my mom into a fight.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
So I grew up as an acknowledged but illegitimate child.You hear a lot of talk about families like ours.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"In the end, though, my dad was home more than he was away, and I wasn’t miserable at all.Except for being totally sick of that environment.Sick of the town, sick of the situation, sick of everything.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I was dying to get away from it all.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I could almost convince myself it was a good thing my mom had died, because now I would never, ever have to go back there.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Except for the fact that I no longer saw my dad as much as I used to, I didn’t regret anything.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He had already sold the apartment where my mom and I used to live, to keep it from becoming the epicenter of an all-out dogfight among his relatives, and he’d put the money in my bank account.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt like I was being awarded damages for her death or something, and I didn’t like that; but on the other hand, the cash was my inheritance from her.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And that was all I needed to be free.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There was nothing left in my old hometown now to show that I had ever been there.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I couldn’t say that made me sad, though.Take my mom’s club, for instance: When you went in during the daytime, the place looked dark and a little dingy, and it stank faintly of alcohol and cigarettes.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt utterly, totally blank there.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And when my mom’s flashy outfits came back from the cleaners and I saw them in the daylight, they seemed so cheap and flimsy it was pathetic.All those emotions, balled up, were how I felt about the town.It’s no different, even now that I’m going on thirty.Last time I saw my dad, he stared at me with moist eyes.I’ve come to resemble her.“It’s such a waste—the best times of our life were still to come.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We were looking forward to old age, relaxing, traveling together.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
We were planning to go on a round-the-world cruise.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If I’d known things would end this way, we could have gone and done all that stuff instead of making excuses about my job, about how your mother couldn’t spare the time, couldn’t afford to leave the club.”I’m sure my dad must have played around when he was younger, since he could hold his liquor and loved to socialize, but as far as I know he was never seriously involved with another woman after he and my mom got together.My dad has this notion that he has to come across as a playboy, and even though he tries to act the role, it’s obvious that it’s just a pose.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He’s the sort of guy who looks like a dweeb no matter what he does—and what’s more, he’s the perfect image of a balding, middle-aged hick.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There’s nothing even remotely sexy about him.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He’s totally uncool.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So earnest that a real, bona-fide playboy would burst out laughing at the sight of him.At heart my dad is an uncomplicated guy, but his position, the need to take over his father’s business, put a lot of strain on him, and he never seems to have felt any desire to break out of that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So he’s muddled through life, going through the motions, doing whatever it takes to fit into a recognizable mold.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The son of a rich, land-owning family.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The president of an import-export company in a provincial town.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That, at any rate, is my take on him.I guess my mom was all he had—the one flower that smelled like freedom.He was careful never to let outside business intrude on the spaces he shared with my mom.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He made it seem like the man he was at home was who he really wanted to be.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Whenever he came to spend time with us, he threw himself into household tasks: fixing the roof, puttering in the garden, going out to eat with my mom, checking my homework, tuning up my bike.My parents never even considered leaving town to try and find a lifestyle that was actually their own.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because being there together, hemmed in—that was their way of life.I think now my dad is afraid, more than anything, that I’ll abandon him.He’s not really afraid.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He just thinks about it, with a shiver.He wonders if one day I’ll tell him: We never had the same family name anyway, so starting today, that’s how it’s going to be.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I don’t want anything more to do with you.Sometimes, for no reason, he puts money in my bank account or mails me food.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I call to say thank you.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His nervousness is palpable, radiating from the receiver.I know what he’s thinking: We’re still father and daughter, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Right?I thank him, and I accept the money, but I’ve never told him in so many words that our relationship will go on like this, like a real family, because I don’t feel I need to.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s not the kind of relationship we have: he’ll always be my dad, whatever anxieties the little prickings of his conscience may inspire in him, and even if I did try to abandon him.Unlike my dad, I don’t have to worry about these things.I wouldn’t be unwilling to lean on him for support if the need arose, but at the same time I know that if I let him give me anything too solid, too permanent, certain people out there who are driven by a jealousy and a desire I can’t fathom would come swooping in around me, eager to inspect it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s totally clear to me that all they’re after are the pleasures of voyeurism, but still it’d be a pain in the ass to have to deal with them.Everything that tied me to my hometown was a pain.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The less of it the better.I know my parents had their own ideas, but from my perspective their feet were shackled and the chains bound them to my hometown.All my life, I cherished the possibility of escape.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I worried that if I started going out with a guy and somehow botched things up and fell seriously in love, if we ended up having a splendid wedding in some hotel in town—or even worse, if I happened to get pregnant!—well, that would be the end of everything.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So while my classmates thrilled over their puppy loves and fantasized about getting married, I held myself back.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Before I did anything, I considered the possible consequences.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And as soon as I graduated from high school, on the pretext of attending an art school in Tokyo, I made my getaway.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I left home.My body knew.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It sensed the discrimination, subtle but real, all around me.Sure, she’s the daughter of a prominent local figure, but c’mon—he knocked up the Mama-san of a bar, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s the kind of girl she is.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The feeling oppressed me, squeezing all the more tightly because I knew it was only in this city, nowhere else, that my dad mattered.When I came to Tokyo and became an ordinary art school student, just like everyone else, I felt so free and light I thought I’d float up into the air.I remember how I felt when my father’s relatives came to see my mom laid out in her coffin, everyone overcome with curiosity, fascinated by her, jealous of her, putting on a show in their obligatory black mourning suits and dresses and kimono, all made up in their phony solemnity, their faces full of grief but their eyes shining, biting into her … I wanted to strip and dance naked in front of them, because maybe then I could have demolished the fake, slimy atmosphere they had created.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"As long as I live, I’ll never forget that feeling.But the mourners’ dirty stares couldn’t touch my mom’s body: her corpse was eased into the flames and made pure.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I hadn’t realized her cremation would bring me such relief.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I could see that their curiosity was perfectly well satisfied by the clothes my mom was wearing, by her ordinary good looks, and by the intensity with which my dad had prepared a funeral that was, in the end, magnificent, and for which no expense had been spared.It was my duty to lead the ceremony, so I made a speech, I smiled at people, and every so often I shed a tear and dabbed at it, just for show; but inside, I was raging, quivering with a sense of indignation that I couldn’t communicate to anyone.My fury was lofty, pure, cool.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was an emotion that none of these people, struggling so hard to impose a shape on a life when life has no shape, could begin to understand.I was grateful, though, despite everything, when one middle-aged woman who lived nearby and my mom’s few friends reached out to me; I had some good moments with them, and we shared a few cups of steaming tea.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Everything in life has some good in it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And when something awful happens, the goodness stands out even more—it’s sad, but that’s the truth.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The women didn’t have to say it, because their eyes did: We know, darling, we know you’re hurting.And yet … when I saw my dad clinging to the coffin, sobbing and wailing, I knew that I had gotten the short end of the stick in all this.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"My dad wasn’t paying the slightest attention to anyone but her, and here I was getting miffed about things that were totally pointless.Standing there, a witness to the end of the century’s greatest romance (even if my parents were the only ones who saw it that way), I was just a little girl, trembling at the death of a parent.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Of course, maybe that’s only to be expected.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"A husband is different from a daughter.At any rate … when my mom appeared in my dream that night, it was the flowerlike her, not the other one.The mom I really wanted to see, who seemed to be peeking out bashfully from underneath an umbrella of thin, fluttering petals.She spoke to me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
We were in the hospital room where she had lived out her last days.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She hadn’t sat up in the longest time, so when I saw her doing that in my dream, leaning against the headboard, I couldn’t help feeling nostalgic.A breeze blew in through the open window, making the sunlight churn brilliantly in the air, and in her pink pajamas my mom looked just like a high school girl on an overnight class trip.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
She was enveloped in a sort of beautiful haze.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The flowers her visitors had brought seemed like they were about to dissolve into her light.She was too dazzling to look at straight on, so I fixed my gaze on the film of dust that had accumulated on the windowsill.My mom spoke to me.“You know, Chihiro, darling—all it takes is one little wrong step and you end up feeling frustrated your whole life, like me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If you’re always angry, always yelling at people, ultimately that just means you depend on them.”I know, I thought, I know.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You weren’t really the sort to nag at people, to fawn over your regular customers to protect your business, or to snap at Dad over the phone when he was too busy to come see us; you weren’t the kind of person to grumble, at such times, What right do I have to complain?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m just your partner, after all, not a real wife.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Your outlook wasn’t so jaded … the truth is, Mom, you weren’t even a wildflower blooming in a field, as they say, you were such an extraordinarily delicate, transparent person that, if anything, you were like a blossom softly unfurling its petals on a cliff somewhere, so high that no one ever came your way, no one but birds and deer … I know, I thought, I know.Dad knew, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He understood, the best he could, and watched over you.Because when you were relaxing with him, you always looked like a little girl.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You were like children, both of you.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Only society, the world at large, wouldn’t let you be.I guess you just lacked the courage, the guts to strike out on your own.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And so when it all came to an end, you were still living that way, a life you never meant to be anything more than a stopgap, filling in for the real thing.These were all just thoughts running through my mind, but of course these things are easy in dreams.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
My mom nodded.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And then she continued.“I didn’t want things to be that way.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I never really liked makeup, either.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I hated the idea of having plastic surgery done so I’d look young again, I was terrified of the surgeon, and I was frightened of seeing people there, at the surgeon’s, who wanted to be beautiful.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"In one way or another, I was always in pain, always scared.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But when people told me I should do something, I started to think that maybe I had to, and so I would—it was as simple as that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And once I’d done it, it was done, and I had to cover up how scared it made me, so I’d turn it all into a joke, even though deep down inside my heart was aching.“Of course I didn’t want to be always griping at your dad.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I worried constantly that he might drift away from me, so I clung to him as hard as I could.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I knew there were other ways, besides anger, to show what I was feeling, but the anger just came.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Somehow I’d ended up on this path, instead of some other, and it turned out that on this path there was no turning back.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Being anxious only made me more anxious, and play-acting got a better response, so that was how it had to be.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I couldn’t stop myself.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"In the end, I died before anything could change.“But you know, Chihiro, from where I am now I can look out over it all, and I understand much better, I understand a lot.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I see so clearly now that a lot of what happened—it’s not that I’m regretting those things, it’s not that—but I didn’t really need to worry so much,” my mom said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“You see what I mean?”From where I am now … Is it heaven?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Is heaven real, then?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I thought.My mom smiled vaguely.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And she went on.“I was frightened of so many things, in my vanity, that ultimately I couldn’t protect myself any other way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Try not to be like that, okay?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Be sure to keep your tummy warm, try to relax, both your heart and your body, try not to get flustered.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Live like a flower.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
You have that right.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s something you can achieve, for sure, in your lifetime.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And that’s enough.”My mom smiled brightly, and all of a sudden I remembered how, when I was little, I used to push the blanket off my stomach when I slept, and when my mom came in to check on me she would tell me to keep my tummy warm.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even in my dream, tears came to my eyes.All throughout my childhood, whenever my eyes fluttered open at night, my mom would be there, giving my bare stomach a gentle pat, rearranging my pajamas, spreading the blanket over me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"How many times had I seen her do this?This is what it means to be loved … when someone wants to touch you, to be tender … My body still remembers that feeling, even now.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
My body knows not to respond to fake love.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I guess maybe that’s what it means to have been brought up well.Mom, let me see you once more, I prayed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I want to touch you.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"To smell your smell.I miss even the club, in all its daylight dinginess, now that I know it’s gone.Maybe it wasn’t the most gorgeous place, but that’s where I come from.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That world had my mom’s smell.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"In the end, I know it was as comforting to me as it was oppressive.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m still a child, I still need my parents, and yet, suddenly, I find that I am walking alone.In my dream, I felt twice as sad and so weak it almost crushed me.Tears were trickling down my cheeks when I woke.Waking up with a start, I glanced over at Nakajima, who was lying beside me on a futon of his own, sound asleep.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He had pushed his arm out from under the covers, and it looked cold, lying there on the tatami.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I gave the comforter a tug, pulling it up over him.Now that I was back in the real world, the dream didn’t seem so sad.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The sense of my mom, of her presence, kept radiating warmly through my chest, though I still didn’t feel any affection for the town where I’d grown up.Why, I wondered, had I suddenly gone back to being a child again?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Probably somewhere deep down, a part of me was still holding on to the past, just a little …I was here enough now, though, to analyze my emotions.The one thing I kind of miss is the apartment, now that it’s not ours anymore.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sometimes I wish I could go back and live there again, and go back to being a child …I cast my memory back.The cheerful mood on Sunday mornings—the sounds of programs more fun and easygoing than anything on TV today streaming into the room as my dad sat taking it easy, waiting for what would be breakfast and lunch combined, while in the kitchen my mom experimented with a palette of imported ingredients, mixing up some sort of ethnic dish.… They were both slightly hungover from the night before, and looking back now I realize that something of the tender lethargy that follows sex hung in the air.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Their languor made them seem so gentle, so sleepy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I used to lie in bed as a child, gazing out at that world, entranced.I wouldn’t mind going back to my hometown as it was then.And then, once again, I noticed with a start that Nakajima was lying beside me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s odd.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
What’s he doing here?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If this is a dream, don’t let me wake up.Right, I remember.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He decided to spend the night.Slowly my memory began to kick in.I found myself recalling, without exactly meaning to, the earnest sexual exchange we had bumbled through before we fell asleep, and I felt a bit embarrassed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Now we had our pajamas on, lying on our separate futons, as if nothing had happened.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was as though we had been living together for ages, and yet Nakajima’s presence still came as a shock.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt somewhat bewildered, somewhat calm, somewhat giddy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Maybe that’s why I had dreamed of my mom.I don’t often get to spend time with such an unusual guy.For some reason I had made up my mind that Nakajima wouldn’t want to stay in the same room with anyone else for long.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I had seen him in his apartment with a woman I assumed was his girlfriend, but I didn’t get the sense that they were always together.The night before, Nakajima had told me tearfully that he was afraid if he let this chance go, he’d never be able to have sex with anyone for the rest of his life.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Oh please, I had said, you’re exaggerating.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"At the same time, imagining what it took for him to confess something like that, I started to feel a bit sorry for him, and I got sad myself.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
My mood grew somber.And then what happened?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Did we go all the way?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Or not?We hadn’t been drinking, and yet I could remember only fragments of what had happened.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Whatever, I thought, who cares.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He’s still here.Again the sense of my mom’s presence wafted through my mind.That was a sad dream, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But it was beautiful.My mom was really there—the mom I wanted to see, who came so rarely.She always spoke her mind, she could laugh anything off, she was proud, and she made you feel that you could lean on her as much as you liked, it didn’t bother her, so eventually even I began to forget her true nature, which that façade concealed.But when I was little—on certain rare occasions when she smiled at me with a special, airy softness, or when we warmed our cold feet against each other in the futon we shared, or when we set out on an exhilarating walk the morning after a snowfall, leaving a line of footprints in the freshly fallen snow … at such times, her true self would surface, she was like a little girl, and it seemed as if she would stay that way forever.I stared blankly at Nakajima’s chest as I relived these memories, watching it rise and fall, and little by little I began to feel calmer, as if I were succumbing to hypnosis.Nakajima.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Nakajima … funny-looking Nakajima.Those pinched nostrils, his stick-thin wrists and long fingers, the way his mouth gaped as he slept, the almost touching scrawniness of his neck, the childish fullness of his cheeks, and the way his smooth hair tumbled over his eyes, so that his narrow eyes themselves, with their long eyelashes, seemed to be hiding … I adored it all, everything about him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I found myself thinking that when, far in the future, Nakajima heaves his final breath and floats up into the sky to take his place among the stars (I know I’ve heard that metaphor before, but it seems to fit him so perfectly—in fact, the image of him becoming a star is almost too appropriate, considering how weak a hold life seems to have on him), my spirit will be with him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"What I felt for him wasn’t exactly love, it was closer to a sense of surprise, even shock.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And so I just kept watching him, unable to get completely involved.He’s still here today, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He hasn’t disappeared.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And I still feel the same way!Each day was so fresh, now that I had become hopelessly attracted to this puzzling young man, Nakajima.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Ever since we started hanging out, I’d been out of sorts.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"For years now I had been thinking only of myself, struggling to get my own way, pressing relentlessly forward, my gaze trained on an ideal future—I’d been focused exclusively on putting as much distance as I could between me and my hometown, steadfastly refusing to put down roots.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But Nakajima was so intense he had rolled right over me, and now he was dragging me along behind him.Here, time didn’t exist.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
We were cut off from rest of the world.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Just being with Nakajima made me feel as if we were detached from history, and had no particular age.Sometimes I even wondered if what I was feeling was happiness.Time has stopped, and I’m looking at Nakajima, and that’s all I want.Yes, I felt, this must be what it’s like to be happy.I’ve lived an utterly ordinary life.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Well, maybe not—I guess in a town out in the middle of nowhere, where just about anything provides fodder for gossip, being an illegitimate child was enough to make me extraordinary.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But there’s nothing unusual about me as a person.So I can’t deny that Nakajima—who is rather odd—was sometimes a bit too much for me, and in my dealings with him, part of me was always ready to run away.All I knew about his past was that he had been through something terrible.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We had never talked in any depth about what it was.Nakajima had adored his mother, but he said she had died, and whenever he talked about her he cried.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Though I didn’t know the details, I could see he had been raised in a way that let him love her like that, openly and honestly; his heart, at least, was in the right place.And I could see that no one else in the world would ever be able to love him the way his mother must have loved him.I doubted I had the strength to deal with anything too awful, but somehow that realization seemed to make it easier for me to be around him.I’m not sure how long it took before Nakajima began staying over.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"At least a year.At some point, quite naturally, without either of us experiencing any big surge of excitement, he started coming to my apartment in the evenings.He’d drop by whenever I was there, and then when he felt the time had come, late at night, he would go home.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Things probably continued like that, one unremarkable visit after the next, for a total of about three months, though I can’t say for sure.It wasn’t at all like we were living together.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was more like being roommates.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We had our own rooms, they just happened to be a bit farther apart than usual.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Nakajima’s presence didn’t put any pressure on me, either.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Quite the reverse: there was a warmth in the core of my chest when he was around.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And that feeling stayed.When all this got started, I was living here in my own apartment, and Nakajima lived on the second floor of the building diagonally across from mine.I had a habit of standing at my window, looking out, and so did Nakajima, so we noticed each other, and before long we started exchanging nods.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I guess it must have been pretty rare in a busy city like Tokyo for two people in two windows to nod to each other when their eyes met, but where I come from, out in the boonies, that was the most natural thing in the world, and Nakajima isn’t the sort of person to bother about such things.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There’s a tenacity in him that’s beyond all that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The intensity of a person unafraid of death, at the end of his rope.Maybe that’s how I knew we would get along.That and the lankiness of his silhouette against the window, and the fact that it made such a perfect picture.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sometimes he let his scrawny arm dangle down over the sill, and I thought he looked wonderful when he did that, like a wild monkey.As time passed, I started opening my window when I woke up in the morning and glancing over at Nakajima’s.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t care whether I had gotten dressed, or what state my hair was in or anything—it didn’t matter.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt close to him, and I’d come to regard him as just another part of the scenery.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"For some reason I was convinced our paths would never actually cross.Even if I didn’t see Nakajima, I’d see his carefully hung-out laundry (he hung it so neatly it was practically an art form.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I bet he could have worn his clothes straight off the line, without even ironing them.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Compared to him, I was so slovenly I might as well have just bunched mine up and tossed them on the veranda), and every so often I’d see a woman who was clearly older than Nakajima lounging around near the window, and I’d think Ah, his girlfriend spent the night.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Good for him.Little by little, an inch at a time, the distance between us narrowed.I always like to be near the window, no matter how cold it gets, so even during the winter, he and I were constantly waving to each other.“How are you today?” I’d say.“I’m okay!” I couldn’t hear his voice, but I could read his lips.And he would smile.It was as if living where we did had imposed a special destiny on us, giving us feelings that no one else could share.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Day after day, we always kept an eye on each other’s windows, and so it felt almost as if we were living together.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When Nakajima’s lights went out, I’d start to think that maybe it was time for me to hit the sack, too, and whenever I came back after a trip home and opened my window, Nakajima would lean out his and shout, “Welcome back!”Neither of us realized what was happening.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That simply by keeping an eye on each other, without even giving it any thought, just by noticing the sound of a certain window sliding open, we were already starting to fall in love.Eventually, as I accompanied my mom down the long, long path she was headed down, making the trip back and forth from my apartment to my hometown again and again, I found myself taking as much comfort in the glow of Nakajima’s window as I did in returning to my own apartment.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"During those heartbreaking days, that was all the happiness I had.The time I spent with my dad and my dying mom in that other place left me with plenty of warm memories, it’s true, but the moment I stepped from the dark station platform into the train that would carry me back to my apartment, I would be alone.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"My mom’s only child, alone.I had to make this journey by myself.As I stood there on the platform, the hard reality of my mom’s imminent death would fuse with my memories of her, and with the air of boredom that clung to the people around me as they went about their ordinary lives—everything bled together, and I felt lost.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I had no idea where I belonged, whether I was an adult or a child, where my home was, where my roots were.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"My head began to swim.I was so agonized, I couldn’t even think, Why don’t you fall in love with Nakajima, then?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Let him be more of a comfort.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Go on, put yourself in his hands!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Wouldn’t it be nice to see that figure in the window up close?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"No, it never even occurred to me.And yet he was there, in exactly the right place, when I needed him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m convinced it would never have worked out if he had been any closer than he was, or any farther away.Our windows were pretty far apart, with a street running between them, but I didn’t feel the distance at all.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We seemed, somehow, to be connected.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It can’t have been that easy for us to hear each other over the voices of passersby and the noise of traffic, but I seemed to have uncannily little trouble making out what he was saying.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The sight of his pale face hovering dimly in the darkness, a carefree smile on his lips, made me feel better than anything.I didn’t go out of my way to tell Nakajima when my mom died.He and I used to go for tea sometimes if we met on the street, and that was what happened when I finally returned from the funeral.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I hadn’t been home for three weeks, so I cleaned the apartment and then went out to buy groceries; I ran into Nakajima on the way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We went into Starbucks, found two seats at the counter by the window, and sat down with our drinks.The hubbub of the place and the scent of coffee and the voices of so many young people left me feeling a bit dazed, since I had been away from these things for a while.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It occurred to me that if I were a ghost, this ambience was what I’d miss most: the ordinary, day-to-day bustle of the living.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Ghosts long, I’m sure, for the stupidest, most unremarkable things.“I won’t have to spend weekends away anymore,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I have hardly any family left in my hometown now, so I’ll just go for the occasional visit.”Nakajima took a sip of his coffee, frowning at its heat.“Your mother died?” he said.I was taken aback.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“How did you know?”“You’ve been going back so often lately that, well, I kind of …”His answer didn’t explain anything.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I guess he noticed how out of it I’ve been, I thought, that clued him in.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Nakajima picks up on these things.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
My reflection in the window looked a lot smaller than usual.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I looked kind of wilted, fuzzy around the edges.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Maybe if you knew what to look for, you could tell at a glance that I had lost a parent.“I won’t be lonely on the weekends, then.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I shouldn’t say this, I know, but I’m glad.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I mean, it was so dull without you, last week, and the week before that, with your window totally dark.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You have the nicest window, you know?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
None of the others can even compete.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s not flashy like the others, or bleary—your window gives off this nice, quiet light.”“Really?”I wasn’t sure I liked being told that it was good my mother had died, but I’d been subjected to so many formulaic expressions of shared grief in the past weeks that I was kind of touched by his honesty.“I mean it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When your light is out, Chihiro, I feel so alone I can hardly bear it.”Whenever Nakajima said my name, every single time, it sparkled like a treasure.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I had no idea why.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Wow—did you see how that flashed?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Say it again for me, please!Only I couldn’t tell him that, so I simply replayed his voice, speaking my name, within me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Something in his tone made me feel, for the first time, a sexy thrill in being with him; but that wasn’t all—for some reason, it also made me feel proud.“I guess it’s good I came back, then, huh?”I couldn’t suppress my tears as I said this; I cried a little.“I know, it hurts when your mom dies,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“It was hard for me, too.”Not knowing much about his background, I simply thought:So he doesn’t have a mother, either.“Yeah.” I sniffled.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“But it’s a road we all have to walk, right?”I squeezed the big cup of chai between my hands as if I were hugging it to me, clinging to it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And then, the very next moment, all the things I’d had to confront in such a short space of time, and the fear that maybe I no longer really had a home or a family to go back to—all that lifted, just a little, and I felt free, at ease.About two weekends later, Nakajima started coming over.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It wasn’t a big deal, he just came.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"One second, it seemed, he was in that window, and then the next he was in mine.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So I didn’t even feel the need to rethink our relationship.We had run into each other in the street earlier, just like always, when he asked:“By the way, Chihiro, do you have a boyfriend?”“Not anymore,” I replied.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I was dating this busy editor who only had weekends free, and after I started caring for my mother we never had time to get together, so he dumped me.”“Ah.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The bozo didn’t like it that your mom was more important.”His use of the word “bozo” made me grin.Everything he did was adorable.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I always saw the best in him.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We’d taken our time turning toward each other, from our two windows, piling each little moment on the next until, deep in our hearts, something clicked.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And so the surface remained unruffled.“Yeah, I think that was it,” I replied.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“So it was kind of hard to care.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Trying to make time to see him would have been much, much harder on me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I guess it was kind of a relief to see the last of him.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because more than anything, I really needed time alone—that and some serious sleep.”“I know what you mean …” Nakajima nodded.He had a habit of frowning slightly when he nodded.That same night, he started coming to my place to hang out.We took to doing things together: eating dinner, going out for yakiniku at a neighborhood bar (neither of us, especially Nakajima, liked eating out, and we never went drinking), taking turns having baths and cracking beers when we got out, sitting together without talking.It was odd, but somehow my apartment seemed brighter when Nakajima was there.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"For the first time in my life, I felt that I had a real friend, and that I wasn’t alone.At some point, I had decided that Nakajima was gay, and the woman who sometimes came to stay with him was just a friend, and that he had his own means of taking care of whatever urges he had, out in the city somewhere.I got the sense that he wasn’t really into sex, and he was shockingly thin, and although there were days when he would consume an astonishing amount, ordinarily he ate almost nothing, so overall he didn’t seem very energetic.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was that woman who came over, of course, but they didn’t really seem to be involved, and I assumed that on the rare nights when he went out, he headed to a part of town where guys like him gathered.Or maybe it was my pride that made me want to believe that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Because he seemed so totally uninterested in me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Like I could get dressed in front of him and he wouldn’t even blush.Then last night, Nakajima really, really hadn’t wanted to go home.He kept delaying, trotting out so many excuses that I made a joke of it.“What, are the debt collectors coming?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"An old girlfriend?”“I kind of think something bad happened to me on this day of the year, a long time ago—I feel really uneasy,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I’ve got a weirdly precise memory, mentally and physically, and I never do well on the anniversary of a bad day.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m sorry, though, I can’t tell you about what happened right now.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ll get even more agitated if I remember the details.”I was tempted to point out how self-centered he was being, seeing as it was my apartment and he was the one who had come over.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But Nakajima looked like he was really hurting, and I got the sense that whatever the story was it was pretty heavy, so I decided not to press him.I just asked if he wanted to stay over, and he nodded, and that was that.We left the lights on after we lay the futons out.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I read a book, and Nakajima asked if he could watch some movie on TV, and watched it, and for a very long time neither one of us spoke.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When the movie ended and Nakajima turned off the TV, I decided maybe it was time to go to bed, and I had just closed my book, thinking how nice it was to have someone else in the room, how reassuring it was to hear him doing this and that, when he spoke.“Actually, it’s not easy for me to have sex.”He was gazing up at the ceiling.“Ahh … really?” I said.I felt a light tremor of surprise, as if he had confessed that he loved me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’d assumed he was intentionally avoiding that topic.Just then, I was still dealing with the discovery that when someone important to you dies, you stop having sexual desires.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It’s like all the water in your body has dried up.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s how it was for me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So if Nakajima had been all slick and eager, I probably would have thrown him out on his ear.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I too had been trying, casually, to steer clear of that kind of talk, that mood.At the same time, I was afraid it would be worse if I lost him now, over this.I was so worn down from taking care of my mother that I doubted I’d feel like sleeping with anyone anytime soon.And I’d seen nothing but butts and bedpans and urine bottles, day in and day out; that might have had something to do with it, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’d had so much time to myself at the hospital, while my mom was getting tests done, that sometimes I even took care of the old man in the next bed.I was kind of tired, I guess, of knowing that people are flesh.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Flesh and water.When I changed my mom’s pajamas, a smell that you could only describe as the smell of water came wafting up from under her collar.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I miss it now, and wish I could smell it again; I wish I could go back to that moment and keep inhaling that smell forever—but at the time it made me think, God, it’s true, people are made of water, and the thought depressed me.I hadn’t told Nakajima this, but the real reason I’d broken up with my boyfriend was that he kept pushing me to have sex and I kept refusing.He was so busy with work that we could only really spend time together on Saturdays, if then, so he ended up dropping in on weekday nights, or on Sunday evening.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And we would end up in bed, of course.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But there was no way, just no way I could get myself into it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"As it happened, this guy was bursting with energy, raring to go, morning and night, no matter where we were.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s nice when you’re feeling good, but it’s not nice at all when you’ve got other things on your mind.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"In other words, I really didn’t like this guy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He was a sort of sex buddy, and when I first met him it just happened that that’s what I wanted.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"In the excitement of our new relationship, I’d mistaken my eagerness for affection.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I thought it was him I wanted.All along, I didn’t realize what had happened, and then one day it hit me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I noticed that I never felt like opening the curtains when he was over, and that clued me in.I didn’t want Nakajima to see him relaxing in my apartment.When it’s like that, no matter who it is, it’s clearly not going to work.On the other hand, here I was with Nakajima—a guy I really did like—hanging around all the time, and still I couldn’t do it because I didn’t feel happy enough.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Even I found it puzzling.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Here I had this young guy I liked in front of me, and I wasn’t holding back, I just didn’t feel turned on.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Needless to say, I wasn’t thinking at all about how Nakajima might be feeling.At most, I had a vague sense that maybe someday I’d fall for him.It’s hard to imagine, I know, but Nakajima had this particular aura about him that made it easy to accept anything, and when I luxuriated in that aura, even the most bizarre things came to seem perfectly ordinary.For instance, after I started spending time with Nakajima, I became clearly aware, for the first time in my life, of the way I had always looked at the world, and of how I wanted to see it in the future.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was because he was so steadfast.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"All the matters in which I’d let myself flip-flop, changing from day to day, all the times I’d tried to make myself into something I wasn’t in order to assuage little stabs of conscience—bitter thoughts about my parents’ relationship, say, or how my mother was living her life … I saw it all so clearly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’d always felt bad, somewhere in my heart, about my inability to sympathize with my mom, who had tried in her own wishy-washy way to accommodate herself to society, and remained like that until she died.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Of course you have to sympathize with her—she was weak, she was only human.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Out in the country, people aren’t as tough as they are in the city.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Living alone in Tokyo as I do now, I’m starting to forget what it’s like, but in the countryside those social connections still matter, and that’s the world Mom belonged to … See how arrogant you are?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I had told myself.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
You’ve got to change that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And I’d believed it.But after I met Nakajima and saw how he dove into each day, though only doing the bare minimum, only what he liked, I realized that I was exactly like my mother—the way she tried to be what others wanted her to be, because she was afraid to be different.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I had that same fawning impulse, too.And when it occurred to me that being that way really wasn’t going to help me get through the rest of my life, I realized that from now on, my mom’s life and mine would have to be completely, unmistakably different.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Nothing about us was the same: the times we lived in, the ways we regarded the world, the things we valued.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That wasn’t to say I didn’t love my mom, or that I couldn’t respect or forgive her.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s not what I mean.Tremulously peeling back that film of false sympathy, I discovered a smooth new willingness to let bygones be bygones forming like new skin underneath.Something flashed in my mind when I discovered that feeling inside me: So this is what it means to grow up.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And I realized, rather late, that Nakajima, who had been on his own for ages, had also been an adult for a very long time.And not just an adult: frail as he seemed, he was also a man.“So if I’m like this, Chihiro, it’s not because you’re not attractive.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’m sorry.”Nakajima peered awkwardly at me in the dimly lit room as he said this.“You don’t have to apologize.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Besides, who said I want you to do anything?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
How do you know what I’m feeling?” I said.“What?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I thought women were like that,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“They always get angry if I don’t try to come on to them after a while, once we get friendly.”“I’m not angry yet.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Besides, we’re kind of still in the process of getting friendly, or maybe that’s not quite right, I don’t know.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I guess I hadn’t really thought about it,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“So relax.”“Okay.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It’s just that all kinds of things happened to me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
A long time ago.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And so it’s like, that kind of stuff, it scares me so much, really, I hate it so much I shudder just thinking about it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Getting naked with people and stuff.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
People being naked.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m so scared I can’t even go to a public bath or a hot springs or anything—do you believe me?” Nakajima said.I had no idea what had happened, but clearly it was pretty serious.When someone tells you something big, it’s like you’re taking money from them, and there’s no way it will ever go back to being the way it was.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
You have to take responsibility for listening.My mother used to say that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"What a stingy way to look at the world, I thought, and yet at the same time I realized it was probably true.So I’d gotten into the habit of withdrawing into myself whenever people tried to talk.When you’ve got a parent who works in a club, you learn very early that the sky’s the limit when it comes to terrible stories.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Whenever a girl I got to know at school came and launched into some sad tale with a “I don’t like to talk about it, but …,” it all seemed totally trivial to me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I guess you could say I was mature for my years, at least in terms of the stories I’d heard.I was still very young, too, when I learned that on some level, whether or not two people had slept together really wasn’t such a big deal.“It’s okay, you don’t need to tell me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Especially if it hurts,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“If I should happen to start feeling that way for you and you still can’t perform, I’ll just go on out and find another boyfriend and chase you out of here.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I won’t give you another thought, really.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So don’t worry about it, okay?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It’s not a problem.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Right now, I’m not in the mood, either.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I mean it.”“… Okay.”Nakajima began sobbing quietly.All of a sudden I felt like I was with a little boy, and my heart ached.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Because he cried like a child.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was as if his tears had nowhere to go, they were meant for god alone.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I wanted to hug him to me, but I thought that might frighten him, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So I tried something else.“Here,” I said, “let’s hold hands as we sleep.”I took his hand in mine.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He had been hiding his eyes with the other hand since he started crying.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And now he was crying even harder.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I kept squeezing his thin, dry hand.The heat in his palm made me think that sometimes it’s too late, some things can’t be fixed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t know anything about his past, but I had the sense that long ago, someone had abused him sexually.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He had been completely crushed, pushed to a point where there was no hope he would ever recover—or maybe it was just a matter of giving it time, I thought.I felt bad for having spoken so flippantly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It’s so easy to be insensitive about things you have no personal experience of.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I couldn’t even guess what it was that had gone wrong inside him.No doubt every little thing I did to try and help him feel better, things any woman would do, only drove him further into a corner.At the same time, seeing how extremely sweaty his face had become when he made his confession earlier had left me feeling a little frightened myself, like he was telling me more than I needed to know.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Right now I was still too exhausted, too wasted to start anything new, but after a little while I hoped I could fall in love, and have more fun, and be young.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Go to the movies, argue, meet up somewhere, go out to eat (even though Nakajima didn’t like eating out), do all that, wasting time in a nice way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s what I wanted to do.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I didn’t want to deal with weighty matters.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s what I was hoping for, except that if I were to go out with him it seemed unlikely we could ever go to a hot springs together, and simply having sex would be an ordeal.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That would really be a pain.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I mean, I want to have fun with my life, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because I was still able, at that point, to treat it all lightly.And then, peering at me with the eyes of a boy in elementary school, his voice stuffy from crying, Nakajima spoke.“Is it all right if we try?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
If we see if I can do it?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If I can’t now, I feel like I never will.”Okay, if you want, I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And that was it.He said he’d be too scared if we were naked, so we fumbled over each other’s bodies in our pajamas.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Nakajima was kind of oddly built, and he didn’t really seem to be enjoying himself.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It felt like I was faking sex with a person who thought sex was a bad thing.The whole time, I kept thinking that it would take a pretty major shift in perspective for me to start wanting to go on doing this with this guy, and that made it even more bizarre.But occasionally something in our movements flashed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was hope.Those are my memories of our first night together.After I said goodbye to my mom, my life seemed to turn rapidly in a new direction.I no longer had to go back to my hometown all the time and Nakajima had begun coming over, and everything happened so suddenly … day after day, it was like living out some weird fantasy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Like I was inhabiting someone else’s dream, some stranger’s.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Did all that really happen?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I wondered, dazed, casting my mind back.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"To her bones, the crematorium.And then I got offered a big job.I was a fledgling painter, you see, who specialized in murals.My palette was unusual, unlike other painters’, so every so often my work got featured on TV programs and stuff, and since I was happy to go anywhere, all on my own—except that I often had to hire a student to take me, since I don’t drive—I had gotten a decent number of jobs, here and there.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s not like I was famous or anything, but there’s always a demand for that kind of work, more than you’d expect, and so I was constantly going off to do a mural on the side of someone’s house or in a garden, on a crumbling wall outside an aquarium, on the side of a shed owned by a neighborhood association.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The main point, as far as I was concerned, was to put my pictures outside, so as a rule I didn’t agree to requests regarding the subject matter.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I would talk things over with people, and to some extent I’d take general suggestions, like if someone said they wanted fruit, or animals, or the ocean or something.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So far I had painted about twenty pictures on walls, warehouses, and playground equipment.That said, I wasn’t passionately committed to earning a living this way or anything.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I tried it once and people liked it, so I kept doing it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s all there was to it.Basically, I just liked the lifestyle I had when I was painting my murals.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t think my work necessarily had much value as art.Sooner or later they were bound to be destroyed or painted over for bureaucratic reasons, after all, so there was no point obsessing over details.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"All I wanted was to have fun painting, to chat and make friends with people who came by while I worked, and for my mural to add just a little bit of warmth to the lives of the people in the vicinity.The wall I’d been asked to paint this time was on the grounds of my old art school.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was a fairly low wall that divided the campus from a place that used to be a preschool and was now a privately run Infant Development Center.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was already a mural on the art-school side, one from a long time ago, but the side facing the center was just plain yellow.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The people who hired me said I could paint whatever I wanted there.I had nice memories of the building itself, since it was near my school and I had seen it all the time when I was taking classes, so I accepted the job immediately when an old classmate of mine, Sayuri, offered it to me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She was the center’s piano teacher.The building that housed the center was a bit old but really charming: it had been designed by an architect who grew up in the neighborhood, and he had worked hard to make it special so that future generations of children could go to school in a fresh, innovative structure.Even when I was a student, I’d loved the center, I loved it more the more I saw it—the shape of the walls; the contour of the building itself; the yard, specially landscaped for children, with a little manmade hill—and I used to have my lunch leaning against that wall, watching the kids.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The building had such an aura of warmth to it that I thought if I had been young enough, I would have wanted to go to school there myself.Apparently it was getting dangerously run-down, though, and since it would cost a fortune to fix it up, someone had suggested that the whole structure be torn down.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
A TV crew came to report on it and everything.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
They presented it as the story of a community trying to save a local building and a painter they had hired to help.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I agreed to do an interview.I wasn’t particularly involved with the political stuff, though.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I just wanted to have fun with the kids who had to pass by to get in and out of the building, and to look into their eyes, and put the things I saw in them up on that wall.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I figured this job would keep me busy all spring; beyond that, I couldn’t say.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There’s no point thinking about the future.That’s what it’s like when you’re creating things.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"On the one hand, it really seems like you’re keeping it all moving on your own, and you can tell yourself that you’ve got inspiration raining down on you, but ultimately you can’t make anything happen on your own.I knew the kids would make it work.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
They would help me put something eternal onto that wall.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Something that would last forever, even if the wall did end up being knocked down.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And that was enough for me.I’d been through so many unfamiliar things recently, looking after my mom and managing her funeral and so on, and it was like this worldly grime had rubbed off on me from dealing with all that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I wanted to wash it all away, throwing myself into my work.Caring for my mom had taken all the energy I had, and I hadn’t had the mental space to think of anything but how overwhelmed I was.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’d always felt that I was striving for something good, though, reaching toward the light, and so it really hadn’t been that bad.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Things had come to feel so normal that I could hardly believe it when I would remember I couldn’t call her up to talk whenever I wanted to anymore, about whatever was on my mind.I had always been thinking about her, about what I could do for her, but she would be unconscious, or in a daze, out of it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That was what really hurt.The meeting that afternoon went smoothly.I had a pleasant discussion with the managers of the Infant Development Center—a couple who had worked, apparently, in a preschool in the United States—and we agreed that I would paint a cheery group of animals or something along those lines.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I was a bit troubled by the bumpiness of the wall, but it would take too long and be too expensive to fill in all the depressions, and I had the feeling I could obviate the need by brushing on a heavy undercoat.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was nothing but dirt in front of the wall, so I wouldn’t even have to spread a plastic sheet.These things would make the work a lot easier, and it sounded as if the local government could help out financially; I’d have about five hundred thousand yen, which was enough to allow me to hire a driver for at least a few days.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Having a helper would make things much easier: it was a boon to have a car, of course, and he could help me lug the twenty or so cans of water-based paint I’d need back and forth every day.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I got permission to borrow the school’s ladder, and with a bit of luck it sounded as if I might be able to leave my tools in the storage room, as long as there was space.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Everything was getting off to a good start.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When you’re working at a semipublic site like this, the least bit of friction at the beginning can make things drag on and on.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It looked as though things were going to work out this time.I wonder if Nakajima will come stay over tonight, too?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I thought as I stood gazing down the length of the wall, all alone.I wasn’t exactly excited, but I felt a warm glow inside.I felt like someone with a brand-new boyfriend.Sometimes, though, I imagined what it might be like if I happened to fall passionately in love with someone else, and it became inconvenient to have Nakajima around.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
What would I do then?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"At the moment, I wasn’t really sure.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He’d had a tremendous influence on me, that was true, but that seemed kind of different from being head over heels in love.Right now it wasn’t really an issue, because I was enjoying myself, but it would be a pain if something like that happened after we had become more deeply involved.And what would happen to Nakajima if I did meet someone else and just chased him out?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"How did I know he wouldn’t kill himself, or go crazy?I couldn’t begin to imagine how someone like him, with his awful past, might feel because I had never suffered any terrible wounds.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Of course, it would be even worse if I thought I could understand.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Recognizing how totally ignorant you are is the only honest way to deal with people who’ve been through something traumatic.Still, I had the feeling it would be okay.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I would go on liking Nakajima.I had taken such great care to reach this point, and now, little by little, I was falling in love.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even putting it in conservative terms, it would probably be fair to say that I needed him—no one else would do.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I had the sense that he was the one.It’s like when you decide to build a house: some people want to go and find the land first, then hire an architect to help them draw up the plans, and then choose the materials for the walls and everything all on their own.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’m not like that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I prefer to wander around until I stumble across something, then do the best I can with it, scrutinizing this thing I’ve discovered, getting to know it for what it is.By the same token, some muralists will neatly fill in all the joints in a wall, transform it into a perfectly white canvas, come up with a motif that harmonizes with the colors around the wall, then carefully block out the sketch on their pad and enlarge it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s one method.But I’m not that type at all.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I just lose myself in the joy of painting, getting the picture up there, and if something goes wrong in the creative process I find a way to fix it and finish the project, no matter what.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m a real believer in working on site, and I’ll be there no matter what’s going on in my life, and I don’t put any stock in whatever it is that happens inside my head.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I look, I sense time passing, I move my body, and I try as much as possible to stay outside.And usually, when it’s all over, I find that everything has come together surprisingly well.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When that happens, I feel like I’ve been dancing, perfectly in time, with the world.That sense of having partnered with the environment, the land, of moving, entranced … and then I say goodbye to it all forever, and head for the next location.Sure, I knew perfectly well that my way was sloppy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But for me, at that point, painting murals was more like a hobby than anything else; it wasn’t a true profession.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
So I was content with what I did.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"At some point I would have to decide whether or not to make this my occupation, and I assumed that as time passed, the problems that arose because I did things this way would sort themselves out in a manner that was right for me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And who knew, maybe in the process I’d become a professional painter.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I figured that if I could refine my method as much as possible, and if things went as well as I hoped, I was bound to produce good results.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
So I just kept pushing quietly ahead.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s the stage I was at then.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I was still at the very beginning.Of course, some people criticized me for doing things the way I did.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Look at her, they’d say, painting those childish pictures, she has practically no technique, and then she has the nerve to do interviews as if she were some kind of famous artist!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Stuff like that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But there was one area, just one, where I had honed my abilities to perfection, and I held to that absolutely.Since I was painting my pictures outside, I would think and think, extremely hard, until I was sure that even decades later my work wouldn’t look out of date.If I focus very hard, right at the beginning, on the scenery and the spirit that runs through the place, I start to get an image of colors and the motif that are right for it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"As long as I don’t misread that, as long as I manage to put myself in complete harmony with my surroundings, and as long as I don’t lose my concentration, the picture I paint will last ten years, twenty years, maybe even a hundred without looking dated.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s the one ability I have faith in.Just as the head carpenter takes pride in the house he’s built, I had made up my own mind, consciously, that I was right about this.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That was settled, and I stuck to my guns.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I was never wishy-washy about that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I stood up to the world, and I made my little mark.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sort of like a dog, I guess, pissing someplace to show it had been there.I don’t know if it’s appropriate to treat these things like they’re part and parcel of being in love, but Nakajima and I never talked about preparations or plans, even dreams.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We just kept going on as we were, here and now.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The two of us, on location.I couldn’t do anything.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Because I could tell—I felt it.No one else is like Nakajima.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"No one in the world is as peculiar as he is.I’d never seen anyone who looked the way he did standing by the window at night, so thin and detached.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He didn’t have the slightest faith in this human society of ours; he stood on the outside looking in.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was something sad in his posture, and something strong, and I wanted to go on watching him forever.Looking back now, I can see that the way I sat gazing at his silhouette against the window in those days, I might as well have been a girl in junior high with a crush on some boy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I wanted so badly to hold his image in my mind’s eye.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"How can he look so beautiful just standing there, I wondered.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And that’s really all it was.It hits so hard …I was staring up through leafless branches.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They were spread out like a hand, and that special, weak light particular to the time when winter ends and spring gets under way was filtering down through them.I used to come to this school every day, so I knew this place through and through.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I didn’t need to worry that I’d paint something weird.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But still, just in case, I kept standing there.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ll make the picture a little bit sad, and a little happy, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Already, like a lovely shadow, a hazy image began to project itself upon the wall.“Heading home, Chihiro?”It was Sayuri, the woman who had gotten me the job.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I assumed she had just finished one of her piano lessons.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She must be taking a break, I supposed, before the next stream of kids comes in the evening.I love feeling the rhythm of other people’s lives.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s like traveling.“Not necessarily,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“You want to go to a café?”“I don’t think I have time for that,” Sayuri said.So I gave her one of the two cans of coffee I’d bought earlier.“Still thinking about that guy?” Sayuri continued.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“The weirdo.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The thin one.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Smart, going to college.”“Yeah, that’s right.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I told you a little about him, I guess?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Nakajima.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m not just thinking about him anymore, actually—I think we’re dating, kind of.”“What did you say he studies?”“He said something about research on chromosomes, but I have to confess I have no idea what that means in terms of what he actually does.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Right now he’s working on an article about Down’s syndrome and the presence of chromosome 21 and what happens when you … I forget, he tried to explain it to me a couple times, but it was too complex, I didn’t get it at all.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Hardly a surprise, I suppose, seeing as he’s writing the article in English.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I couldn’t sneak a peek even if I wanted to.”“So it’s too complicated for even you to remember.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The main point is that you have no idea what the main point is—that much I get.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You seem to be getting along all right, though, even if you can’t make heads or tails of something that must matter a lot to him.”“It’s true, I know.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If only he were into cultural anthropology or folklore studies or French literature or something, it would be so much easier.…”“Then you’d be able to understand it, at least a little.”“Of course, sometimes it’s better not to understand.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I kind of like how our days are now.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I feel more at peace than I ever have,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Everything’s so calm, and quiet, and yet at the same time there’s something powerful—it’s like living underwater.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The rest of the world keeps seeming more and more remote.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s kind of like, I don’t know, I don’t imagine things will get any more exciting than they are now, but I can’t imagine us breaking up, either.”“You just started dating and already you feel that way?” Sayuri laughed.“I haven’t asked him about it,” I said next, “but it’s pretty clear that something happened to him, ages ago, something really bad.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But you know how it is when you’re with someone, you kind of figure stuff out, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So I decided there’s no hurry, I’m not going to rush him, and I guess now things have kind of settled into place.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Do you think I should ask him?”“I don’t see the need.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I mean, if things are going well.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I just hope that whatever that awful thing is, it isn’t something really awful.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Like he committed a crime, or ran away from his debts, or went bankrupt.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Or maybe that would be okay, as long as it doesn’t become an issue now.”“Yeah, well, judging from his personality I’d say it probably isn’t anything like that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Who knows, maybe it’ll turn out not to be such a big deal.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He did tell me that he was really close to his mother, and it was a huge shock when she died.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I get the sense he’s been hurt in some way much deeper than that.”“I hope whatever it is isn’t still an issue.”“Oh, I think it is—I feel it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’m just hoping it’s not so bad that he can’t go on living with it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And hey, he’s made it this far, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Maybe everything will be fine, and it’s just a matter of going on with his life, treating it as gently as possible.”I spoke like I was praying.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Please, I thought, keep living.Nothing I could ever do would relieve Nakajima of his pain.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That had only become clear once we started living together.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I had seen him wake up screaming in the middle of the night and bolt up, trembling; I’d seen him break into a sweat when he found himself in a crowd; I’d seen certain kinds of music give him terrible headaches; and I’d had to listen to him telling me that for a long time after his mother died, what he wanted more than anything was to follow her.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"These were just fragments, but the longer we were a couple, the more I saw.When there’s a plus, there’s always a minus.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If there’s a powerful light, the darkness that is its opposite will be just as strong.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"To me, Nakajima seemed like a creature in a legend, unable to control the forces raging within him.“In this line of work, I come into contact with kids who have all sorts of troubles,” Sayuri said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Some are just cruel by nature, and some have mental problems, but other than that I get the sense that usually it’s the parents who are the problem.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When something happens with the parent of a really young child, something seems to get paralyzed inside, or broken, and even if it’s a really tiny part, it has to be built up again.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I see that pretty often.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s really true, there’s something huge in people like that that can’t be whitewashed over.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s like, you’re at a loss for what to do, because they’ve been broken in so many different ways, so subtly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m just a piano teacher so I don’t actually have to deal with that stuff, but if you’re a preschool teacher or something, you have to interact with the parents a lot more, and I just think that would be so hard.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There are so many messed-up families these days, too many.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Screwed-up parents.”I nodded.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even out by the wall, where I was painting the mural, I could tell.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There were parents and children of a sort you never would have seen before, mixed in among all the rest.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t think Nakajima was one of them, though.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His problem was different.“I know something happened to him, that much is clear, and it obviously wasn’t a subtle sort of thing.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There must have been some really big event in his past.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Only in his case—well, from what I can tell, his parents were divorced, but I don’t have the sense it was particularly acrimonious, you know, and I know his mother loved him really deeply, and it doesn’t seem like anything happened with her, so I don’t think it was a problem with his parents.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s the impression I get, judging from the bits and pieces I’ve heard.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Above all, Nakajima himself is just such a nice person.… I know I keep repeating myself, but really the only thing I can be sure of is that something appalling happened.”“Appalling?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Like how?”“Like he was kidnapped, or sexually abused, though not by his parents.”The moment I heard myself saying that, something clicked.Every so often, that happens.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I say it, and I realize it’s true.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Something close to an answer lay in the words I’d just spoken.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I was convinced of it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I decided just to keep talking.“Anyway, he’s not like other people at all, it’s like, I don’t know how to describe it, like he’s living in the clouds, maybe.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Like when people talk about someone having transcended it all—he’s like that, I guess.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So part of me thinks it’s just in his makeup, and he would have been this way even if nothing had happened.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"For the time being I’ll just keep watching, I won’t rush it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He and I are the kind of people who need to take things slow anyway.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Getting to know each other, talking things through, everything has to go nice and slow,” I said.At some point, as I was talking, it hit me how deeply concerned about Nakajima I was.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That I wanted to know, sort of, except that at the same time I didn’t.That was why I felt this way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"As if maybe, maybe, I was starting to commit.Maybe I’d begun to love him, maybe at some point I’d actually fallen for him in a big way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"For the first time in my life I seemed to be in love, not just playing—a woman loving a man.I could tell because I was cautious, the way my mom had been with my dad.That’s how she was: the deeper she loved, the more hesitant she was.“How about money?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Does he have his own?”“Yes.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He says his father will keep supporting him until he finishes his Ph.D., and I guess he has whatever his mother left, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He still has his own apartment, but since he spends nights at my place he puts money in my account for food and utilities and stuff.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Every month.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And he calculates it all incredibly precisely.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Down to the hour, down to the yen.”“He’s good about those things, then.”“You’re pretty down-to-earth yourself, huh, asking about that?”“Well, anyway, it sounds to me like everything’s fine.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
You can go on living together like you are for the rest of your lives.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s kind of weird, but then so are you.”“Yeah, I guess I’ll just let things progress this way for a while,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Thinking to myself, Assuming there’s any progress.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“But enough about that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You came out because you had something to talk about, right?”“Right.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I wanted to apologize.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"For making you go on TV, about the mural.”“Oh, don’t worry about it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I don’t mind.”“You’re really famous now, huh?” Sayuri said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“Features on TV and everything.”I laughed.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I’m certainly not really famous.”“In this part of town, that’s enough to make you a celebrity.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And a lot of people are hoping that now that you’re painting this mural, if your work attracts attention, maybe the building won’t be torn down after all.”“Hmm.”“I’m sorry.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t mean to get you involved.”“Which side are you on?”“Oh, I don’t want them to tear it down—of course not!” Sayuri said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I live for this center.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Lots of my students have been coming here for years.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s not why I suggested you, though.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I just wanted to have one of your pictures here, a huge one, where I work.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s the truth.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I had no intention of using you, or of making you create something only to have it destroyed.”I knew Sayuri meant it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s the kind of person she is.She was staring at the ground.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I gazed at the fine hairs around her ears, her thick eyebrows, and I could feel how serious she was.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"No doubt all kinds of people had been pressing her to do all kinds of things, but she kept it all to herself, protecting me.“Really, I’m happy to do any number of interviews about the mural.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Only, when it comes to these other things, I don’t really understand the issues,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“Sorry.”“Thanks for being so willing to help.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And on the off chance that this place should happen to be torn down sometime soon, and this wall goes with it, I’m really sorry,” Sayuri said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I’ll do everything I can to protect it, as long as I’m here.”“It’s okay,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I don’t paint for the future.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Besides, it’s not your fault.”“Either way, I’m planning to take a lot of pictures,” Sayuri said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“And I’ll have them keep copies in the district document center.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s something I’m definitely going to do.”I would have been lying if I’d said I didn’t care at all whether the mural survived.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
But it’d be an even bigger lie to say I wanted it to survive forever.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I just liked coming here and feeling things each day, and recording those feelings in a kind of big way in a picture.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That was how I saw what I was doing.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I guess my attitude was sort of casual.When I compared myself to Sayuri, who was so incredibly dedicated and so earnest in her dealings with the kids, I felt sort of bad.The truth was, it didn’t make any difference to me whether my mural was knocked down or admired or whatever.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And if the Infant Development Center closed, as long as the people there were good and smart, I felt sure they would carry on their work somewhere else.Maybe I was afraid of seeing anything as absolute.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I wanted to keep moving, like a stream, and I wanted to go on watching everything from a distance.That’s how I was.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt close to people, but I didn’t have any friends I could really share my life with, our hearts melting together.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Something always failed to communicate.Nakajima was the first true friend I’d ever had, in my whole life … I really believed that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He was extremely frail, and yet there was something in him I could trust.I saw myself reflected in our relationship, as if in a mirror.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And I knew that I wasn’t wrong.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And I was at peace.All along, just because I lived away from my mom, I thought I’d achieved independence, but now that she was gone I finally realized how much, in my heart, I had depended on her.I never asked my mom for advice, but whenever I was going through an unsettled period like I was now, I’d call her up to talk, or go back to visit, just to see her face.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Now that she was gone, I realized these little things had given me a core to hold on to—or maybe brought me back, for better or worse, to the place I came from.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I wasn’t even sure what that meant … whether that place was something that had existed before I was born, or not.When I was young, I used to turn and look back at my mother’s face to make sure I knew where I was in relation to her; now, I had to take stock of my situation by myself.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sure, I could see myself through Nakajima, but the second I glanced away I lost it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Parents are absolute; he wasn’t.I’d watched my mother dying for so long that now I could hardly remember how, back when she was healthy, her spirit used to shine.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"All that came to me now was the agonizing sound of her final breaths, the smell of her dying body that had filled the hospital room, things like that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The sense of powerlessness, knowing that my mom was suffering alone, and that in her universe I was no help at all—I could recapture that feeling, but nothing else.I read in some book that if you try to hold people back too much when they’re dying it keeps them from being reborn as a Buddha, and that had stuck with me, somehow, maybe more than it should have, so I tried hard not to cry too much, and kept telling my mom how much I appreciated all she had done for me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Now all I can do is think how stupid I was to act like that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I should have cried my eyes out.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I should have thrown myself wailing at the coffin the way my dad did, and made a huge commotion.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Forgotten everyone watching, the mourners and what they’d think, and just been myself.If I had done that, I bet my mom wouldn’t have come in my dream the way she did that night, worried because she saw that part of me was holding back, unwilling to fall completely in love with Nakajima.About two weeks after Nakajima first stayed over, he asked me for a favor.“I want to go see some old friends, but I’m scared to go alone.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Will you come?”We hadn’t had sex again since that first time, but he’d been staying over at my apartment every night.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He always made sure to remind me that he’d recalculate the utility bills.My mural-painting days wouldn’t start until the following week, so the timing was perfect.Since I had so much time on my hands, I’d been cooking all kinds of dishes using a huge package of imported gourmet ham that my dad had sent.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Fried rice with pineapple and ham, ham and steak, steamed rice with ham, and so on.I tried so many different ham recipes that finally even Nakajima, who really wasn’t particular about what he ate and generally was fine with anything, blurted out, “Can we have something besides ham tonight?”Other than that, all I did was go with the guy I’d hired to help me work on the mural—a guy I knew from art school, younger than me—to buy the paints and assemble the various brushes I’d need, and then I sat at my desk working on preliminary sketches.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was a pleasant time.I love sitting at my desk drawing—it’s like painting in miniature.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Since I never simply transfer my sketches to a wall, it’s all about getting a sense of the partially formed image I have in mind—I’m just doodling, basically.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
But drawing on a small scale has its own particular pleasures.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It’s like when I used to play house as a kid.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Tiny little utensils, tiny little people.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And yet everything is blown up to actual size in my mind.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s the kind of pleasure I get out of drawing.The wall I’d be painting was long and low, so I planned to do something bold with a lot of monkeys linked in a kind of flow, but I was having a hard time envisioning a design for it, something that would look good and fit well with the site.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I couldn’t believe how poorly my imagination was serving me, and I started wondering if maybe it would be best to just go and start painting, or maybe take a survey of the kids.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I was coming to the end of my rope.If I were just going to paint the sort of design an amateur could come up with, they might as well call in a bureaucrat from city hall to do the job.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There needed to be a touch of eeriness in it, something private.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
But what?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"What sort of memories involving monkeys did I have—when, come to think of it, was the last time I had even seen a monkey?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Should I go to the zoo to see some?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Those are the kinds of issues I was grappling with.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So when Nakajima asked if I would accompany him, it sounded like a great way to get my mind out of its rut.“Sure,” I said, eyeing a magazine.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Maybe we can have a picnic on the way!”But when I glanced up and saw the expression on Nakajima’s face, the lighthearted feeling with which I’d replied withered.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I could see this was important to him.Until then, things had been going along the same as always, without any trace of progress.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We had gotten up that morning, shared an omelet that I’d made with our last eggs (and ham, needless to say); just then, I was sitting in a rather shocking pose, in the middle of doing my toenails, and Nakajima was tapping away on his PowerBook, working on a report.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’d just been thinking that when he got to a stopping place maybe I’d make some tea when he mentioned his friends and wanting to go see them.Sayuri had been right: Nakajima wasn’t like us.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She and I had gone to an art school that wasn’t very prestigious; he went to a university one district over that only people who are really, really good in school can get into.Naturally, I asked him about it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“How did you get so good at studying?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Did you like studying from the time you were little?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Was that it?”Nakajima sat thinking for a while without moving.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Then he said, “One day, all of a sudden, I felt this powerful urge to study, as if I were trying to get something back that I’d lost.”“Was that … after your mom died?” I asked.“Yes.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You see, during the time when I was away, my mother and father started arguing about all kinds of things, and then they started living apart, and in the end they divorced.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Since then I’ve been in a situation sort of similar to the one you’re in now—I still get living expenses and tuition and stuff, and I still go visit my father from time to time, and … well, anyway, the point is that I was in high school when my mother died, and I decided I didn’t want to go live with my dad.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I mean, he’d been living up in Gunma since the divorce—that’s the prefecture he grew up in—and I didn’t really feel like moving to a new place, just like that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He had remarried, too, and they had kids.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So I decided I’d live on my own, and then, well, I had enough money so it wasn’t like I had to work like mad to make ends meet or anything, and I’m certainly not a big spender, so all of a sudden I found myself with lots of time on my hands.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I thought a lot about what I should do.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I wanted something where I wouldn’t have to deal with people too much, and where I could keep my involvement to a minimum, so I’d be able to do my own stuff, and ideally I thought it’d be nice if I could make people’s lives better—that’s the life I wanted.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And after looking into various options, I settled on genetic research.”“But why would you want to pick something so difficult?” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“Did you know someone around you who did the same kind of thing?”He paused awkwardly again before he continued.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Well, yeah.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When I was away from my parents, the one adult I felt close to had graduated from a department like that with a degree in genetics, and hearing about the topic from him made me think it might be interesting to learn more.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And then after my mother died, I was all alone and I was depressed, and since I had nothing else to do I studied constantly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I was totally obsessed.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Of course, it was all focused on passing the entrance exams for university.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t want to deal with people, so I didn’t go to cram school or anything, I just did it all myself.”He went on to explain his methods in detail, at great length.I wanted to ask why he’d been separated from his parents, but I didn’t.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I just listened.He said he taught himself to concentrate really fiercely, to cut his mind off from his body.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He found that it wasn’t all that hard, but he also discovered that it was a dangerous thing to do in the real world.The story was as strange as his tone was bland.By the time he got into the university he was aiming for, he weighed forty-five pounds less than he had before he started.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He had stopped being able to eat at all, and he collapsed on a road somewhere and found himself in the hospital.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They had to feed him through an intravenous drip—otherwise he wouldn’t have survived.“Sounds like the wrong way to go about becoming a doctor,” I said.He laughed like crazy at that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s true he’s in the graduate school of medicine at his university, but he said none of the students in his program are training to become doctors.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s a program for future researchers.Once Nakajima started studying he couldn’t stop, and his grades got even better when he figured out how to detach his mind from his body; he got so engrossed in what he was doing that he felt as if he could have forgotten about his body altogether.“The only thing was,” he said, “I realized then, in a pretty painful way, that there’s always a lag before the body responds to the orders the mind sends out.”“A lag?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"What do you mean?”“It was fairly easy in the beginning, when I’d do this self-hypnosis thing, setting it up so that my body would function at the absolute minimum and all the energy would get routed to my mind instead.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That much was no problem, and I guess that made me overconfident.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The catch was—I’m not sure how to explain it, but it’s like the process accelerated once it got underway, and even if I sent out the order to my body to engage again so that I could get some nutrition and move my limbs and stuff, even when I was really trying, it was like a merry-go-round, the way it can only stop very gradually, by spinning slower and slower.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I hadn’t taken that into account, and I had ignored my body too long, and so I stopped the merry-go-round too late.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I almost died.”“All right,” I said, “I realize that you can do that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But don’t, not anymore, okay?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It puts too much of a strain on your body.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You end up paying for it later on, right?”“That’s why I don’t study like that anymore.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I do just enough to keep up.”Nakajima smiled.Wow, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"This guy says he’s doing just enough to keep up, and he can still succeed in grad school, not to mention that whenever he’s not studying he’s writing another article or doing some sort of preliminary research, surveying the literature or something.… He must be really good at this academic stuff.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I was impressed.“I studied my ass off all that time, and then one day, just like that, it hit me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m on track to finish my coursework, there’s no question about that, and as long as I keep at it with the articles I’ll definitely get my Ph.D. And then I can go on the market in Japan, and the chances are that there will be a good match somewhere, and I’ll find a position at some institute.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Only I’m not sure that the future will be all that bright if I just go on like this—if I stay here in Japan, I mean.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
So I’ve been mulling things over.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I kind of think it might be good to go somewhere else.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That never occurred to me before.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Until now, it was all I could do just to stay alive.”All along, Nakajima’s tone had remained measured and easy.“That’s not anything I’d know about,” I said, “but if you’ve been able to manage this much, I’m sure you can do anything.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I mean it—anything.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
You just have to put your mind to it.”Somewhere else.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I.e., somewhere outside Japan.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I.e.… we split up?So as far as he’s concerned, my apartment is just one step in the great escape?I had the feeling that it wasn’t yet time to talk about that.Nakajima had said he wanted to go see his friends, and yet whenever he talked about it his expression got incredibly gloomy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So I asked him about it.“Do you feel a need to see these friends of yours now?”“No, it’s not that,” he said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I feel like maybe now I can.”“If I come along, you mean?” I asked.“Exactly … I mean, you’re so cheerful,” Nakajima said.“Maybe I’m not as cheerful as you think,” I replied.It wasn’t that I was annoyed; I just didn’t want to let him down.I had the feeling that Nakajima was taking one aspect of me—the straightforward, easy-going part that emerged when I was with him, the cheerful surface that I had inherited from my mom—and blowing it all out of proportion.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If so, he might feel terribly betrayed when my dark, somber side eventually showed its face.“No, I know that, it’s just … I know I can’t express it very well, no matter how I phrase it, but you’re just right.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"This sounds kind of odd, but your proportions are just right.”I sort of knew what he was trying to say.Considering how smart Nakajima was, I bet he could have found a way to express more precisely what it was like to push his body to the limit while studying, or his perspective on the way my emotions were structured inside me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He was just being nice, communicating on my level.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s what made it sound vague.Still, I had the sense that right then it helped for him to be talking about something, and so I decided to draw him out.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I intentionally cocked my head slightly, feigning puzzlement.“I mean, for you love is more important than anything else, right, Chihiro?” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“But you don’t try to control other people, do you?”“I guess that’s pretty true,” I replied.“And you cherish the memory of your mother?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Of course, everyone has little knots in their hearts, no matter what their families are like—but wouldn’t you say that in your case you feel love and hate in ordinary, healthy amounts?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even if one may seem a bit stronger at times?”“Yeah, I’d agree with that.”“And you don’t hate your father, do you?”“No, I don’t.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
If anything I think he’s kind of lovable.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The environment we lived in wasn’t ideal, but I suspect that it actually made it easier for us to express our love than in your average family.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We didn’t fit into any ready category, so we all had to work that much harder.”“Exactly—you don’t have that sense that you can take your family for granted, that’s why I feel so comfortable with you.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You see your family members for what they are, and you look at me in an ordinary way, without wishing that I was somehow different,” Nakajima said, his tone very level.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“That’s what I like about you.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m extremely, almost pathologically sensitive to violence, and I pick up on it immediately when something violent is happening.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Most people are constantly perpetrating little acts of violence on others, even when they don’t mean to.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You almost never do that, Chihiro.”“How about you?” I asked.“I’ve never been able to discuss this before,” Nakajima said, “but honestly, I felt oppressed the whole time until my mother died, because of the way she was always fretting over me—no one else mattered.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
She became so focused on me that ultimately my father got fed up and left.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It really weighed down on me, but at the same time certain things had happened to keep us apart for a long time, and during that whole period I’d yearned to see her so badly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But then when we were finally reunited, when she was actually there, in person, her love completely overwhelmed me.… Like, if I was going out for a while, she couldn’t rest easy unless she’d checked to see when I’d be coming home, and if I was even a minute late she would be waiting up, crying, you know?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s the kind of woman she was.“And to make matters even worse, she died before we’d had time to live together as long as most mothers and sons do, and so I felt even more confused.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I have these two different images of her etched into my memory: one as this idealized mother, and the other as a sort of pressure weighing down on me—obsessive, feminine love.“The ideal side of her, though—that part of her was so extraordinary, it just blew me away, and I felt so small beside her, and I know that if it hadn’t been for her I wouldn’t even be here today.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m so grateful to her that if she were still alive, I could spend my whole life trying to pay her back and it would never be enough.“There was one time in particular when things got really terrible.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was a period when we were like a couple in love, lost in our own maze with no way out.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We were both going regularly to the hospital then, and we were in such bad shape that our doctor suggested we go and spend some time in a small house that belonged to some relatives of ours.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was a run-down shack way out in the country with nothing around it, and we did stay there for a while, living a quiet life.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was cool in the summer, but in the winter it got incredibly cold, we were always freezing, but the scenery was gorgeous, you could always see the lake, and it was lonely, and beautiful.“And now those friends of mine, the people I’ve been talking about, they live there now, and I want to go see them, I’ve been trying, but whenever I think about it—just look at me, you can see how it makes me sweat.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ve thought about going any number of times these past few years, but every time I end up making all sorts of excuses to myself, and in the end I decide not to go.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"No matter how hard I try, I can’t for the life of me figure out what it is that makes me break out in a sweat like this—my memories of my mother, or the memories I share with my friends.”“If it brings back such painful memories, maybe you don’t need to go,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“Why don’t you just wait until it starts to feel right?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Don’t force it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Go when you’re ready.”Nakajima looked miserable when I said this.“If I do that, I won’t ever get to see them.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ll never see my friends again.”“When’s the last time you met?” I asked.“I haven’t been out since before my mother died, she and I visited together … it’s been about ten years, I guess.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Maybe longer.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Though occasionally I call,” Nakajima said.“You really want to see them?”“I really do, more than anything else in the world,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I want to see them so badly I can’t stand it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
All the time.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Lately, now that I’m with you, I’ve been feeling more desperate than ever to see them, like I can’t hold myself back anymore.”“And how many friends are we talking about?” I asked.“Two,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“They’re brother and sister, both old friends.”I had no idea where Nakajima wanted to take me, but I trusted him implicitly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I trusted him with my whole body, even with my skin.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When you’re with someone every day, if there’s even the tiniest glimmer of a contradiction inside them, you pick up on it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Nakajima was an uneven sort of character, it was true, but he always struck me as totally sincere.“All right, then, let’s go.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Is it far?”“About three hours, including changing trains.”“Will it be expensive?”“I’ll pay.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m the one dragging you along, after all.”“That’s okay.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ll enjoy the trip, too.”“No, I should get the tickets and everything.”“Really, I’m in pretty good financial shape now.” I laughed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I’ve got a job.”“Why are you so willing to go with me, anyway?” Nakajima said, looking a bit surprised.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“You don’t even know where it is.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’d never be able to go on a trip like that.”“It’s someplace you really want to go, right, even though it hurts?” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“It’s only natural that I come along, if I’m the only person who’s able to help you do that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"After all, you’re here in my apartment every day.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We see each other all the time, and we’re together because we like being together, not because we have to be.”If I were really in love, I don’t think I could have said that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I probably would have tried to toy with his feelings a bit more, or maybe I would have had trouble finding the words.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
But all I felt then was a desire to help.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And while I didn’t yet know the reason, it frightened me much more to think of him getting hurt than it did to think of someone else getting hurt.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Just the idea made me shudder, and left me feeling as if a heavy stone had lodged in my chest.“Thank you,” Nakajima said quietly.The next day, we took a train headed north.We got off at a small station and started walking.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was still a chill in the air—it was the sort of weather that makes your face feel cold, but doesn’t do anything more than that.From time to time, a cool ray of sunlight shone through the clouds.There were trees everywhere, their new leaves just beginning to appear.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even the greenest branches were dotted, here and there, with sensuous, round buds, clenched but swelling, vibrant in the haze of fresh growth.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The air was clear; I could feel it coursing through my body.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Soon we had left behind the kernel of activity around the small-town station, and after that it was just Nakajima and me ambling along nondescript streets.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The mountains in the distance were still capped with snow.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That white and the brown of the trees rolled on and on under the blue sky, a dry pairing of colors.Then, at last, we came to a small lake.It was a weekday, so there was no one around.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The water was so still you almost felt like it would absorb any sounds that reached it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The surface might have been a mirror.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Then a wind blew up and sent small waves drifting across it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The only sound was the chirping of birds that whirled around us, high and low.“It’s over near that shrine.” Nakajima pointed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“Where my friends live.”A small red torii was visible on the far shore of the lake.I looked up at Nakajima.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He was sweating buckets, and his face was pale.“Are you okay?”I took his hand in mine.“I’m okay.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
This is the hardest part.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’ll be fine once we actually get there.”Nakajima’s hand was frighteningly cold.What horrors had he endured?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I wondered.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Physically, emotionally.Poor guy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Those were the words that came to me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There wasn’t anything else I could say.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I knew my sympathy was useless, but I couldn’t help it, I pitied him so deeply.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt sorry for him for having had to find a way, somehow, to pull himself together, far from his parents.An awful struggle was playing itself out inside him now.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That much I could tell.From my perspective, we were simply taking a nice walk around the edge of a lake, amid lovely scenery, on an invigorating early spring day.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
But Nakajima didn’t see that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He was in such pain he might as well have been in hell, dragging chains behind him with every step.“Hey, Nakajima, hold on,” I said.“Huh …?” He was in a daze, clammy with sweat.“Sit down a second.”He was obviously dying to get this over with as quickly as possible, and he looked annoyed and reluctant, as though he wished he could knock me over and run on ahead.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I could see that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I clearly sensed that he wanted to refuse.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And yet, for my sake, he grudgingly squatted down.It’s only in the early days of a relationship that we have to put up with such things.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Soon each person figures out what the other dislikes, and stops doing those things.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So at this stage it was all right, I told myself, I could still do this.Okay, so that was just me making excuses.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Ultimately, I guess I’m one of those people who always thinks with her body.I crouched down beside Nakajima, threw my arms around him, and squeezed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Without saying a word, for a very long time.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"All along, I heard his breath hitting against my neck.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There was a dusty odor in his hair.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The sky was incredibly far away, and beautiful enough to make a person wonder why our hearts are never so free.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The wind that gusted over the lake was chilly, and carried the faintest hint of the sweetness of spring.We stayed like that until Nakajima’s breathing calmed and he stopped sweating.There was a kind of intensity in us then, but it wasn’t sensual.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Neither of us was in control enough for that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I was the one hugging him, and yet I felt as if we were clinging to each other, he and I, at the edge of a cliff.Sooner or later, he’s going to disappear.I felt sure of this.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"However much I loved him, and as beautiful as the world was, none of it was powerful enough to take the weight off his heart, that heaviness that dragged him down, into the beyond, making him yearn to be at peace.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
My body sensed it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And my soul.But this memory will remain, I thought.Otherwise, what point was there in his being born?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Tears welled in my eyes.“Thanks, I’m okay now,” Nakajima croaked, even though he wasn’t okay.Then he gave my hand a squeeze and coldly shook me off.When we had walked on awhile, my vision started clouding.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I thought maybe I was having an anemic spell because I’d hugged Nakajima so hard before, and from worrying so much.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I started having some trouble breathing, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was like his suffering had rubbed off on me.“I’m sorry, whenever I try to visit them—I simply can’t do it,” Nakajima said, noticing what was happening.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I can’t help thinking about stuff, even though I shouldn’t.”“That’s only natural,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“You’re always talking about how you can’t do things.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I wish you wouldn’t.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I don’t want to hear that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It makes my ears ache just listening to you.”“I know, it’s a habit.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s because I used to be in an environment where you either had figured out how to do things well or you died.”“Really …?”The people we’re on our way to see hold the key to all this, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And maybe when he tells me about them, he’ll share something of his own past, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There was a point in his life when that’s how things were.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I do want to know.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When you love someone, you want to know.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even about the things that are hard for them.The lake had started looking blurry, and I realized a mist had gathered.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"All of a sudden, the world before me was shrouded in it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The lake, seen through the mist, was submerged in a pale, milky white, as if a gauzy curtain hung between it and me.We kept walking.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The path faded into the haze, and we found ourselves padding along with no view of what lay ahead.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He’s used to walking here like this, I noticed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even tiny lights oozed outward, acquiring round, glowing halos.“Hey, there it is,” Nakajima said.Beyond the red torii was a narrow stone stairway that led up to a small shrine.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
From up there you would have a good view of the lake.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Straining my eyes, off in the distance to one side of the torii, I saw a house.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was just as he had described it: a run-down shack.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When I saw that wooden structure, blurred by the mist, I wondered if it even had electricity.A few missing steps in the front stairway had been replaced with boards.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Holes in the windows were covered with scraps of plastic sheet.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It seemed pretty dim inside.Looking more closely, though, I saw that the boards and the plastic had been put up with great care, very simply, in the most practical way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Everything looked old, but it wasn’t dirty or unkempt.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It called to mind the phrase “honest poverty.”Various little signs here and there suggested that the people inside were living proper lives: the potted plants, for instance, and the way spokes shone on the ancient bicycle that stood off in an unobtrusive corner, even though there was a hole in the basket.“Hello!” Nakajima shouted.The house was as still as the lake—so quiet I wondered if anyone was there after all.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But after a few moments, someone wandered out.He was an adult, perhaps thirty-five or so, and yet he was extremely small, like a child.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His face seemed kind of shrunken, giving him the look of a bulldog.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His eyes were sparkling, though, and there was something noble in the way he carried himself.“Hey, it’s Nobu!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You really came!” the man said.He had on a sweater covered in fuzz and a well-worn pair of khakis, but he still looked as tidy as the house.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His long hair was pulled into a neat ponytail, and while he was a bit plump he stood perfectly upright.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He made a very good impression on me.“Mino!,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It’s been ages!”Nakajima was beaming.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There was no trace now of the fear and trembling he had endured at the thought of seeing this friend.I guess you could say he was acting like a man.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You could also say he was a pain in the neck, making me worry so much when he was going to be just fine in the end.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Either way, I was flabbergasted by the change.Seeing him like this, I wondered how much he might still be hiding from me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I could see we had a long way to go.“So at last you’ve come to see us,” the man said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I heard about your mother.… I’m sorry.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I guess it’s been a while since that happened, too, hasn’t it.” He gave a little smile.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
A cute smile that lit up his whole face.“I know—it took time for me to finally make myself come.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I wanted to see you so badly, but it made me anxious.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
This place is full of memories of my mother—it gets me down.…” Nakajima gazed up at the roof and squinted.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Then he turned to me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“It was okay, though, because I’ve got a guide.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I finally made it.”“Nice to meet you,” Mino said, looking my way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“And her name …”“Chihiro.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
She’s my girlfriend.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Chihiro, this is Mino,” Nakajima said.I smiled and said hi, my mind awhirl with all I didn’t understand.There was something special in their intimacy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They could smile back and forth without speaking, like soldiers who had fought side by side.The wind was beautiful, racing through the sky.If only we could live someplace like that, so high and lovely, free as birds, liberated from our worries.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But we don’t, and I have to confess that Nakajima was a weight on my shoulders.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Not a heavy one, but a weight nonetheless.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Until lately, I’d lived in a world all my own, and I didn’t like the idea that Nakajima might come to depend on me more than he already did.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t really dislike it, but I didn’t like it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"In short, I was ready to make a run for it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I don’t want this responsibility, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I don’t want to be part of the gloominess these not-normal people exude.Mino peered at me, grinning, as these thoughts ran through my mind.And all at once I felt content, as if I had an angel watching over me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I didn’t even feel that I had to hide what I was thinking.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His eyes were so clear it seemed as though all the bad bits of my personality were being swept away, just like that.“What about Chii?” Nakajima asked.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“How’s she doing?”“She’s inside.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Come on in,” Mino said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Sorry it’s so cramped and dirty.”Nakajima and I nodded to each other and went inside.The inside of the house was as plain and tidy as a European country cottage, the kind you see in movies.As far as I could tell, the first floor only had a kitchen, a toilet, and a bath.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Mino led the way into the kitchen, and after we had each picked a chair we thought we could sit in from the mismatched group around the table, we gingerly sat down.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The table was perfectly square, like an oversized school desk.“I used to live here with my mother,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“It was like camping, like in an old French film—we didn’t have much, but every day we would gather up whatever we could find, and we lived like that, very quietly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Always looking at the lake.”“Wow,” I said.“It was hard sometimes, but in retrospect I had a lot of fun.” Nakajima had gotten a bit hyper, and his tone was cheerful.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“The house is so small, we used to go on walks every day.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Just wandering around the lake.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sometimes we’d go out in a boat, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
We felt better each day.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
People look so beautiful when their expressions show that they know they have a future.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You couldn’t help seeing how my mother was reviving—it was like watching the mountains turn green, the trees growing new leaves.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I remember it so clearly, all that, how happy it made me.”Tears filled Nakajima’s eyes as he spoke.The whole house was still.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Outside the window there was nothing but the lake, hazy in the early spring.To me, it was a frighteningly desolate scene.Mino brought water to a boil over a low flame, and carefully made tea.I took a sip.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
A delicate fragrance filled my mouth.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"This was the most delicious black tea I had ever drunk in my life.When I told Mino this, he fidgeted shyly.“The springs here are good for tea,” he said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I go and get water every day, just for tea.”No way, it can’t just be the water, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s because this is all he has, in this circumscribed world.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Looking out at the lake, drinking good tea.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s his only luxury.And what an enormous luxury that is.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He’s created a world for himself that no one else can interfere with, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"A world free from all external impositions.Mino’s bearing was sufficiently dignified to expunge the last traces of a middle-aged-lady-poking-her-nose-into-everything sort of sympathy that had managed, in some mysterious way, to keep smoldering inside me, until then.Good tea is eloquent enough, it turns out, to change a person’s mind.Nakajima and Mino exchanged various bits of gossip for a while, giddy as two schoolboys.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I half listened, staring out at the lake.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sometimes there were waves, and for a second it would look very cold, and then it went back to being a mirror … I watched the water near the shore, smooth as a piece of fine cloth, through the glass.“Actually, I had a question I wanted to ask Chii.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s not a big deal, though, if she’s in bed,” Nakajima said.“What are you talking about?” Mino replied.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“She’s always asleep.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Let’s go see her.”Then, for a long moment, he peered at me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And then he spoke.“You see, Chii, my younger sister, has been bedridden for ages.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She’s not exactly sick, but her liver and kidneys aren’t in good shape, so she doesn’t have much energy—it’s hard for her to move around.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
So she really is always in bed.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even when she gets up to go to the bathroom, she has to sort of slide along the wall because her muscles have atrophied.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She hardly eats at all, either: only one meal a day, and basically it’s just rice porridge and saké.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
She almost never gets up.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I guess you could say she’s sick, then, in a general way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But she isn’t seeing any doctors, and I’m happy to give her as much attention as she needs, so we’re fine just as we are, living like this.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I move her arms and legs for her sometimes and encourage her to walk around the house, but I try to be as gentle with her as I can.”I wasn’t sure how to respond, so I just said, “I see.”“And—well, when Chii wants to say something,” he went on, “she looks into my eyes and says it inside of me, into my heart.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sometimes the information she passes on is special, and there are people who come to listen to her speak.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s how we make ends meet.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Only she doesn’t always have information, it’s not as if she has something to say to everyone, so as a rule we try to keep all this secret.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So if you don’t mind, we’d appreciate it if you kept it to yourself.”“In other words … it’s like fortune-telling, in a broad sense?” I asked.“You could think of it that way,” he said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“But often it’s simply a matter of enjoying the conversation.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"For some reason, people find that talking to her seems to bring something into focus.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Perhaps it’s because she spends all her time sleeping—she comes and goes just as she pleases in the world of her dreams, she’s free to go anywhere she wants.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And that gives her access to much more information than people have who are up all the time.”“I guess that sort of makes sense,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“And I won’t tell anyone.”“I know.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because you had a reason to come here,” Mino said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He grinned again, and the twinkle in his eyes grew even more intense, like a star.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“You’re welcome to come anytime you like.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Only you’ll never think of this place, never, unless you’re meant to come.”It sounded like a riddle.“I understand,” I answered.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Smiling.He was so wonderful, a smile was all I could give him.“Would you like to meet my sister?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
With Nobu?” Mino asked.“That’s okay.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Nakajima deserves his privacy, and if I were her I know I’d be embarrassed meeting someone new from my bed,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I’ll see her next time, if I come again.”I knew how important seeing Mino and Chii was to Nakajima, and I didn’t want to get in the way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"My role was over now, I thought: all I’d needed to do was keep distracting him, drawing him on until he arrived.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I had done my duty, and now I preferred to hang back.“Why don’t you come?” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“After all, she’s always in bed.”“It’s okay, really.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You have a lot to talk about,” I said.“But I want to introduce you to Chii, too,” Nakajima said.“Who knows, maybe she’ll have some information about you,” Mino said mischievously.I’m easily swayed enough that I was tempted by that, but when I thought about the past these three seemed to have shared I couldn’t help feeling a bit somber, and the temptation waned.“I’ll just say hello and come right back down and wait here,” I said.“All right, then, let’s go!” Mino said.Climbing a steep, creaky staircase, we came to the second-floor landing, which was brightly lit by a small window in the hall.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There were two rooms, both with their doors shut.Mino opened one without saying a word.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I tensed up, feeling a little nervous.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"A nice scent, like roses, wafted from the room.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It wasn’t roses, though—it was like a sign.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"A sweet sign.“Oh, Chii!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You haven’t changed a bit!” Nakajima said, almost sobbing.“Come on in,” Mino said, and so I stepped inside.There was a cheap wooden bed with a cheap pink fleece blanket on top of it, and almost buried under the blanket a small, thin woman was curled up, sleeping.She was so tiny she could have been a child, but she was just like Mino: looking closer, I could see that she was an adult.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Her body was slight, and her arms were as scrawny as bare branches; her eyelashes, long and vigorous, were the only part of her that looked different.“Uh, she looks like she’s really asleep,” Nakajima said.“No, no, she’s completely awake,” Mino said.“Good, then she can hear me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Hey, Chii, it’s me, Nobu—long time no see!” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“Sorry I didn’t come visit sooner.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Hey, I brought my girlfriend Chihiro along today.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I wanted to introduce her to you.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’ve been doing really well.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I went to college, and now I’m in grad school.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Studying all the time.”Mino put his hands to his head.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was a pause, and then he spoke.“Well, that’s splendid.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It sounds like you’ve been working hard!”The voice was totally different.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Okay, I thought, so this is her voice.And what if all this is just a delusion of Mino’s—what if his sister is dying of some sickness of the heart, wasting away, and Mino, unwilling to acknowledge that, is making up this internal voice of hers?That would have been the logical response, but thoughts like that didn’t stand a chance in the unique, noble atmosphere of this room.“And, my, what a complicated woman friend you’ve brought along!” Mino said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Don’t you find that it … hurts, not letting even half of your emotions out?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I see you’ve overcome your hatred for your parents with that easygoing love you were born with.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And in the process you started thinking about things, and you ended up taking on this docile personality—but aren’t you really more spirited and free, more spoiled, and extremely into sex?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"At the same time, I can see you can have genuine respect for other people.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You’ll be coming here again before long, on your own.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Let’s talk more then.”I was startled when I realized she was talking to me.The information was accurate enough, but not enough to prove this was genuine.Mino came to his senses.“I’m sorry,” he said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“My sister tends to be a bit harsh, and she’s not used to covering up the things in her heart—we used to get in trouble all the time, everywhere we went.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was so bad, sometimes I wonder if it might have been all the complaining she had to put up with whenever she opened her mouth that landed her in bed like this.”“Your sister is rather, uh, forthright, isn’t she?” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Only not in an unpleasant way, not really—personally, I admire that sort of bluntness.”True, her comments were pretty over the top considering that this was the first time we’d met, but I couldn’t believe she was trying, for some inexplicable reason, to hurt me.“It’s kind of you to say that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And please, please don’t think that I’m actually the one who’s thinking and saying those things.” Mino smiled.I nodded goodbye and went downstairs.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"To tell the truth, I had absolutely zero desire to come back here and listen to her analyze my personality in even more detail.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
But it wasn’t as though I was offended.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I couldn’t put my finger on the reason, but somehow I was really moved by the odd air of grace and nobility that clung to the two people who lived in this house.I don’t know what Nakajima asked Chii that day.All I know is that it wasn’t about us or how long he would live, but about a more cheerful topic.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I could tell that right away from his face when he came downstairs.And I know what he told me: “You remember the other day I mentioned that eventually, if I can finish up my degree, I want to go to Paris and work for this famous research institute?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I asked her if that was possible, that’s all.”Paris.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He wants to go to Paris.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Knowing him, he’ll study like crazy and write articles and send them out like there’s no tomorrow, and he’ll get his degree in no time.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And then I suppose this precarious life of ours will be over.I was startled at how sad the thought made me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I could almost hear my heart breaking.No, it’s not that, I tried to tell myself, because I didn’t want to admit how attached I had become to him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m not that heartbroken, it’s just that it’s so early in our relationship.“Of course it’s possible!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
How can you even doubt it?” I said.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I could have answered that question for you.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You’ll definitely be able to go.”“I have the feeling I’ll find some way to sabotage myself,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Though according to Chii, this time next year I might already be in Paris.”Nakajima looked truly delighted.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That alone, I thought, made it worth the trip.We had one last cup of tea and chatted a bit, and then Nakajima and I left that adorable little house behind.Mino stood under the light outside the front door and waved to us for the longest time.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His silhouette was like a lovely little shadowgraph in a locket or something, and the lightbulb beamed into the dark, shining like a jewel.The lake had retreated into the darkness like a deep hole, turning such a deep black that only the contrast with the groves of trees indicated that there was anything there at all.“Are you feeling pressured?” I asked.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Like you have to go to Paris right away?”“No, I’m not rushing,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I just don’t really believe I can do it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I can’t really explain this very well, but it’s like I have this sense of guilt inside me, and sometimes it tries to mess me up.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"All I have to do is make myself think I can do it, just once, and then I’ll be fine, because I can work toward that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Basically, I’m happy to go whenever.”“Oh, good—so you won’t be going right away!” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I’m so glad to hear that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because right now I’d like to go on living like this, just as we are.”Nakajima didn’t reply.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I couldn’t tell if he was happy or disturbed.It occurred to me that maybe he was planning to hurl himself into his studies immediately, so he’d go back to living in his own apartment.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If so, I could at least look in on him from time to time, to make sure he didn’t overdo it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The thought gusted smoothly, cleanly through my mind, like a breeze sweeping across the lake’s surface.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
As though I’d been planning something like this all along.We were crunching our way along a gravel road now.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The light from the streetlamps bled outward into circles, one white ring over the next.Without particularly thinking about it, I had twined my arm around Nakajima’s because it was dark and hard to see the road in places and I was afraid there might be snakes.I mentioned this to Nakajima.“No snakes yet, it’s too cold,” Nakajima said.“But there might be something else.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Insects, say,” I said.His arms were like sticks, but they were warm.Suddenly he spoke.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I like this life, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
We get to go home together.”This was his response to what I’d said earlier.I felt as though we had been walking like this forever.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
At the edge of this lake.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Through scenery so gorgeous it seemed like another world.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m sure I’ll walk like this with lots of other people, I thought, but I’ll probably never feel this way again.Not because being with Nakajima made my heart ache, but because he made me feel how precious our time together was.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was so lovely there, and so incredibly quiet, that if even one more person had been with us I knew the mood would have been destroyed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Well, maybe it would be okay if it were someone like Mino.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But it was true, I could feel it—all it would take for this delicate world of ours to come crashing down was just a single extra element.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sturdy as the bond between us was, it was also somehow terribly fragile.“Don’t go away, Nakajima,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I mean, I’m not talking about Paris or anything, you can go to Paris.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I just want you to do your best to stay here, in this world.”“I don’t particularly want to—to go away,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Only it’s like there’s something inside me, in my body, that’s constantly telling me I don’t belong here.”“You’ve got to fight it, Nakajima.”“I am fighting, it’s just that I’ve lost so much, I can’t fight very hard.”“Don’t be a wuss,” I said.“Just look at me, though.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I can hardly have sex with a girl I like.”“That doesn’t matter.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m not into sex, anyway.”“Yeah, right, you can’t fool me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You’re actually extremely into sex!”“Now that’s rude!” I cried.My voice shattered the silence, and seemed to echo in the black night sky.Nakajima was chuckling.I sensed that he, Mino, and even Chii had something in common, though since Chii had just been lying there I didn’t have much of an impression of her.I saw it as a sort of desolate landscape, unfathomably lonely and hopeless, totally wrecked, its very foundation destroyed, but one that was being pieced together again from scraps.Where could they have gotten to know one another?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I was slowly starting to figure it out.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It wasn’t anything more than a guess, but I had a vague understanding, at least, of something.It was so dark, though, I didn’t even want to admit it could be part of the truth of life.I still believed, back then, much more than I do now, that the world was essentially a happy place, full of the sounds of families having dinner together, the smile on a mother’s face when she sees her husband off to work in the morning, the warmth radiating from a loved one in bed beside you when you wake up in the middle of the night.That’s not how it was with Nakajima, in his world.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His universe included everything dark, and that darkness was always there.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It had nothing to do, say, with him being a man and me a woman, it was a result of the different paths our lives had taken.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I thought I had a pretty good grasp of the world compared to other people my age, but that was nothing compared to the weight Nakajima carried inside him.Still chuckling, Nakajima took my hand in his, and we walked quietly on around the lake, heading for the station.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was peaceful.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
We decided to buy a bentō box for dinner and eat it on the train home.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It felt, that night, as though each step we took brought us closer to the future.When we turned to look back, the lake had misted over.It seemed pale, vaguely warped.The next week, my mural-painting days got under way.I set out from the apartment at eight each morning, as if I were a construction worker on the way to a site.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because that’s when the light is best.I would plant a kiss on Nakajima’s cheek, then head straight for my wall.The first day, I painted a few frolicking monkeys.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"After that, I decided that I would paint a big lake on the left third of the wall.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Of course, I’d put monkeys around the lake, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Calm monkeys, and lots of trees.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"A monkey brother and sister, and a mother monkey and her son.I knew it would be painful to paint these things, but I couldn’t stop myself.A little girl came and said, “You’re drawing monkeys?” And that got things started: little by little, children began gathering around.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I seriously bawled out a few boys who were about to start messing around with my paints, and then I apologized, and after that even they slowly started to appreciate what I was doing.One skinny little boy with big eyes and a flat nose came over and asked, “Does it mean the school won’t be closed anymore when it has your picture?” Clearly Sayuri and his parents had been talking to him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"People called him Yotchan, and he was taking English classes.“No, I’m afraid not.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even with my picture, it may be closed.”“Then why are you drawing it?”“Because there’s a place to paint, and they asked me to paint it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Won’t it be nicer to have some pretty colors here, even if it’s only for a little while?”“It isn’t for art?”“Hardly,” I said, laughing.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“Not by a long shot.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s just a picture of some monkeys.”“Um, are those monkeys ghosts?” Yotchan asked.Following his finger with my eyes, I realized he was pointing to the four monkeys over by the lake.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I had only sketched their forms, so they were just uncolored outlines, half transparent.“No, they aren’t ghosts.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ll color them in later on.”“Oh,” Yotchan said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I thought it was funny.”Children are incredible, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It never would have occurred to me to paint ghosts into such a happy picture.I kept mulling over the composition as I brushed on the colors.The area around the lake was going to be the most colorful, and I wanted to keep it balanced with the rest of the painting, so I would probably be doing it last.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
But I couldn’t leave those monkeys as ghosts.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’d give them some fun-looking colors, but nothing too loud, since they lived quiet lives.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’d use the happiest tones I could come up with.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And I’d paint in some tea, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And cake.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’d fill in the area around that harsh sleeping beauty with lovely, lovely colors.Surprisingly, Nakajima didn’t stop living in my apartment even after I got wrapped up in the mural and began staying out as long as the sun was up.For some reason, somewhere in the back of my mind I’d thought that as soon as I started working on the mural, he would vanish.Sometimes I’d have a dream like that, and I’d wake up with my heart racing, bolting upright on my futon.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Tears would be streaming down my cheeks—even I was startled.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I had come home to find that Nakajima was gone, along with all his stuff.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I rushed to the window, hurriedly slid it open, and looked out, but his window was dark.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There was nothing to indicate that Nakajima had ever existed.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"To think that it was all over, so soon … That was how the dream went.Each time I had it, I realized again that it could happen at any time.And yet when I came home worn out from painting, Nakajima was always there.Sometimes he had even started the rice cooker.Other times he was asleep, exhausted from his studies.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Stacks of incomprehensible books about biochemistry and genetic engineering and so on would be stacked up next to him, their pages marked with Post-its.Nothing about our days together was certain.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The only thing I could count on was that for the time being he was still here with me, still living.One evening, I came home to find Nakajima lying on the floor, snoring.His PowerBook was open on the low table where we ate our meals, so I assumed he must have fallen asleep while he was working.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I brought a blanket over and was putting it over him when something caught my eye.He had something tucked under his armpit.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
A hard-looking silver rectangle.It was such a bizarre sight that at first I couldn’t for the life of me tell what it was.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Actually, that’s not quite right.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Maybe I did know what it was, and my brain just refused to accept it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because it seemed so completely out of place, so surreal.It was an old wire rack for toasting mochi.A chill ran down my spine.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It didn’t make sense.It seemed like it would be painful to sleep with something like that stuck in your armpit, so I tried very delicately to slip it out.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But he had it clamped there so tightly, like a child squeezing a thermometer much harder than necessary under his arm, that it would have been impossible to remove it without waking him.I could see from the ferociousness with which he held on to the rack that it was extremely important to him, but even so, deep down, the discomfort I felt seeing it there lingered.I thought long and hard about whether I should mention it when he awoke.The thing was, I couldn’t very well pretend I didn’t know.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Besides, this was my apartment.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Should I slip out of the room when he woke up?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That seemed kind of odd, too.I wondered what it might mean.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Maybe … that wire rack was actually the only thing that turned him on?Did I love him so deeply that I could go along with something like that, if he had that side to him?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Would I feel absolutely comfortable with it?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"(After all, there are all kinds of people … I once knew a guy who could only get excited by goldfish.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He couldn’t masturbate or have sex or anything unless he had a goldfish in front of him.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
)I wasn’t sure.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The honest truth was that while I might love him that much, it was equally likely that I hadn’t yet reached that point.I was still worrying about this when, just like that, Nakajima woke up.He opened his eyes, bolted up in bed, and sat there dazed, unguarded, with the wire rack still under his arm.“Want some coffee?” I asked.“Oh, hey, Chihiro, you’re back.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I guess I must have fallen asleep,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I didn’t sleep a wink last night.”“You can keep sleeping if you want.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s all right with me,” I said.“No, I’d better get up.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Coffee sounds great.”With that, he casually took the rack out from under his arm.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He gave a just-woke-up sort of yawn and sat staring blankly ahead, his hair tousled.Then at last he noticed that I was staring at the rack, looking like I wanted to say something, and he said, “Oh, this?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It’s a memento of my mother.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I sleep with it under my arm when I get the feeling I’m going to have a bad dream.”“Oh … I see,” I said, surprised at how easily the mystery had been solved.“There’s no particular reason I chose the rack,” Nakajima said, evidently sensing from my expression that I was wondering what it had to do with his mom.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I just held on to it because it’s something she always liked, and she took good care of it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And it’s thin, so I can keep it between the pages of a book.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I think it used to be my grandmother’s, and we used it in our family ever since.”“That was the best memento you could find?”“Well, I can’t very well sleep with papers, and I don’t wear jewelry, and stuffed animals are unsanitary, and I’d look silly wearing a woman’s watch … in the end this just felt right.”“But what made it feel right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It looks like it’d hurt.”“No, it doesn’t.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s really thin.”Nakajima held out the rack, smiling.“It’s okay for me to touch it?”“Sure.”It was just an ordinary rectangular wire rack, a little browned from use.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Light and hard and cool to the touch.As far as Nakajima was concerned, it was just another everyday tool, like a toothbrush or a razor.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That kind of bewildered me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"How it was weird to me, but not to him.“You’ve got the hard version of Linus’s blanket.” I laughed.Nakajima blushed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“So is this really unusual and embarrassing?”It was such an adorable reaction that I couldn’t suppress a smile.“No, that’s not what I meant,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“There’s no such thing as ‘unusual and embarrassing’ here.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We’re at home, after all.”“I’m glad.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I thought maybe I was doing something crazy again.”Casually but lovingly, Nakajima closed the rack between the pages of a book.I think I must have been reeling a bit at what I had just said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because my mom used to say almost exactly the same thing all the time about her club.“There are no rules here, except that you have to sit properly at the bar when you drink.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
People can tell me anything they want.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Things they wouldn’t usually say, things that wouldn’t be acceptable at work—it doesn’t matter.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s what this place is for, after all: they come and pay money to buy themselves, their innermost hearts, a bit of freedom.”She said things like that a lot.She’d say it whenever a customer prefaced a story with the words I’m ashamed to admit this or You’re going to think this is really disgraceful, but …Her openness helped set people’s hearts free, including my dad’s.I guess, I thought, my mom is still alive, here inside me.“Do you mind if I ask how you can tell you’re going to have a scary dream?” I said.“Not at all.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Before I fall asleep, my eyes start moving really fast, and my head starts feeling heavy,” Nakajima said, his tone perfectly ordinary.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“When that happens, I know I’m definitely going to have a nightmare.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I suspect it has a lot to do with how my body is doing, like if I’m particularly exhausted, or if the air pressure is particularly low—stuff like that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I can’t go throw myself into my parents’ arms now, of course, and I can’t ask you to put up with that kind of thing, so when it happened today as I was going to sleep I just put the rack under my arm like I always do.”I nodded sympathetically, though I felt more sad than anything.That night, watching Nakajima’s back as he brushed his teeth, I cried a bit.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I couldn’t help crying when I thought of him sleeping with that rack tucked under his arm whenever he got lonely, ever since his mother had died, as if doing so were as natural as taking medicine for a fever, or having someone give you a scare when you can’t stop hiccupping.But what sense was there in crying?After all, he had found a rational way to deal with his loneliness.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The truth was, I thought, that I was insulting him with my tears.And so I decided not to cry anymore.But when I got up to go to the bathroom that night, the edge of the rack that was sticking out of the book Nakajima had put it in glinted in the dark, and that got me crying again.Nakajima was fast asleep.Suddenly it dawned upon me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He really isn’t the sort of guy who can just go off and spend the night at someone’s apartment, without giving it another thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When he made up his mind to come here, it was because he really wanted to.I was still pretty childish in those days—the truth is, I really was a child—but I prayed then, prayed until my head hurt, that I wouldn’t do anything to betray his trust, and that he would go on feeling comfortable here, in my apartment, forever and ever.I had finished outlining the mural and it was time to fill in the colors; I no longer had any uncertainties about the finished design, which I was gradually coming to see in my mind’s eye.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"All I had to do now was keep moving toward that vision.I enjoyed going out, spending each day moving my hands, without talking.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
This part was the most fun.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Things progress most smoothly when the end is in view, and all you have to do is keep adding layers.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t have to think anymore, and things had settled down enough that I could horse around a bit with the kids.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The day before, I had let some girls paint an area pink.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It ended up being more trouble than I had bargained for because I had to go back and fix the places where they had gone outside the lines, but that was kind of enjoyable, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Fortunately I wasn’t really worried about keeping on a schedule.Sometimes I found myself utterly alone.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Somehow, miraculously, no one would come by, and it would be very quiet, and I was relaxed enough to notice.So what was I thinking then, during those rare moments when I was feeling perfectly at ease, all by myself, in the absence of any children and my student helper, when even the composition of the mural had ceased to concern me?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s not something I want to share.I lean against the wall, pour myself a cup of lukewarm coffee from my thermos.My butt is aching, there’s a crick in my neck.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I feel like I’m getting a cramp in my arm.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"My whole body feels strangely cold.As long as I keep moving my hands, though, I can forget all that.That’s when I notice, all at once, that I’m alone, and I discover the vast sky overhead.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"In the distance, the flag over the school whips madly in the wind; other than that, it’s as if everything has come to a stop.I prefer to keep the thoughts that come at times like that, as I sit drinking my coffee, to myself—the particular texture of the sadness I feel, say.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I prefer to keep those thoughts private.I’ve traveled a long way today, I often think to myself.“We’re having boiled tofu for dinner.”Nakajima was awake when I got home, and he welcomed me in an apron.The scent of well-boiled konbu filled the room.“You look like a gigolo,” I said.My hands and shoes were covered in all different colors of paint.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I threw down my bags in a rough sort of way, like a sailor who had just come into port.“And the lady who’s keeping me is a construction worker,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I can’t imagine any woman coming back from the club she works at, all covered in paint and suntanned, with muscles like the ones you’re getting.”“That’s true.” I laughed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I guess I don’t look much like a hostess.”I had on jeans and a sweatshirt; my hair was tied back; too much sunscreen had left my face blotchy; and I had paint all over, including on my socks and next to my nose.“It always seems like such a waste preparing a meal for one,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“A waste of food and a waste of time.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I don’t feel that way at all when I’m cooking for two.”I stepped up from the apartment’s entryway and peeked into the kitchen.“Thanks for cooking,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Wow, look how neatly you cut the tofu!”The tofu in the pot was divided so precisely it looked as if he had used a ruler.We washed our hands and sat down across from each other to eat.My mother had always been at the club at dinnertime, and Nakajima seemed to have grown up in a rather unusual household himself, so it felt as though we were imitating some sort of lifestyle we didn’t really know anything about, playing at being a happy family.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Neither of us took these moments for granted, and they made us truly content.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We literally ate it up.“It’s great, isn’t it, just eating tofu together like this,” I said.“You know, I’ve been thinking,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“After I graduate, I’ve decided I’d like to get a scholarship and go to the Pasteur Institute as soon as possible.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Just a little while ago I didn’t think I could, but now I do—in part because Chii assured me I’d be able to do it and in part because I’m with you now, and somehow that makes me feel like I can.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It looks like I’ll be able to get my degree, so I’ve decided to go ahead and apply.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Of course, I’ve got to ask for letters of recommendation and send in a sample article and an outline of my research and so on, and there’s an exam I’ll have to pass, but I looked into it and it seems they’re affiliated with an institute in Japan, and there’s this program now that should make it relatively easy for me to go.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
If I don’t make it this year I can try again next year.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And if I’m accepted, I’m thinking I’d like to go for at least six months.”At first it didn’t even occur to me to feel lonely; I was simply glad.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Nakajima could only do things he was really enthusiastic about, so it was good that he felt this way.“What would you do, then, Chihiro?”“What do you mean?” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I’m not interested in Pasteur.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
All I know about him is that he did something with silkworms and invented the vaccine for rabies.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And maybe that his grave is under that institute you mentioned or something?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Is that right?”“That’s a pretty impressive array of useless trivia.”“I learned it all on TV.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"A documentary on public television.”“Ah, that explains it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s funny, though—don’t these things interest you at all, like what school I go to, and what department I’m in, and what I work on?”“Not really.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even if you told me, I wouldn’t remember.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s all DNA and human genomes and that stuff, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And you’re in med school but you aren’t going to be a doctor?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And you do research, I know that, but it’s not like you’re working on Ajinomoto or brewer’s yeast or anything else I’d know about, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Rice bran and stuff?”“No, nothing like that, it’s true.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Listening to you talk, Chihiro, I really get a sense of how lopsided ordinary people’s knowledge of science is.”“You think?”“You really aren’t interested, huh?”“I do remember that you wanted to do research on blue-green algae.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s why you went into a department of agriculture, right?”“I didn’t want to study blue-green algae, I was interested in doing an experiment that used them.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’d cultivate the algae and then investigate the conditions that make it possible to inject certain genes into them.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And I didn’t graduate from a department of agriculture—well, I guess maybe it used to be called that, but the actual name was the Department of Biological Resources, and I was in the Biotechnology Program.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s totally different, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And now I’m in medical school, in the Graduate School of Medicine.”“I’ll never remember those things, you know—I mean, as soon as I hear blue-green algae I immediately assume it’s got to be the department of agriculture, that’s just the image I have.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Besides, it’s not like you’re interested in the program I graduated from, are you?”“The Program of Scenography, Display, and Fashion Design in the Junior College of the N. University of Arts, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And you majored in the scenography thing, not design?”“I can’t believe you remember.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Even I’d forgotten.”“I don’t usually forget things like that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I only have to hear them once.”“So anyway, what was the question?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"What I’d do if you left?”“I’m sure there must be tons of art schools in Paris,” Nakajima said.“Yeah, there are.”“Some half-year programs, some yearlong programs.”“I’d imagine so.”“Well, go to one!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Let’s go together!” Nakajima said.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I’ve decided I’m going to live with you like this for the rest of my life.”“What do you mean you’ve decided.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Are you proposing to me?” I said, feeling suddenly heavy, not at all pleased.“No,” Nakajima said crisply, shaking his head.“Then what do you mean?” I asked.And Nakajima answered.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“That’s just how it has to be.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because I can live with you, even though I can’t live with anyone else.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And I’m tired of always being by myself.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m tired of sleeping alone, with that wire rack under my arm.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Now that I know what it’s like not to be on my own, I can’t go back to living the way I was before.”“Somehow it’s not much fun when you lay it all out like that,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Paris, huh?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I would like to go sometime, only right now I’m really enjoying my work a lot, you know?”“You don’t have another job scheduled yet, do you?” Nakajima asked.“No.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There are a few possibilities, but none of them seem to be in a rush.”“What’s the problem, then?” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Do you really need to be in Japan now, at this moment in your life, at this exact moment in your life?”He had a point.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I wasn’t particularly interested in Paris, but I did like the idea of being able to spend several days going through the Louvre from start to finish, since I’d only been there for about an hour once with my mom.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I hadn’t seen Versailles yet, either.And now that my mom was gone, there was nothing to keep me in Japan.A flood of loneliness hit me the second I realized that.I wanted my mom to be alive, tying me down.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"To be showing her disapproval, telling me, I don’t know, going abroad?—it’s so far, and we won’t be able to see each other.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I yearned to hear those words, to hear her saying them.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I never would again.“That’s true, I guess.”“This idea that you have to stay—that’s how people think when they have a family, and it’s located in some fixed place, whereas you and I …”Having said this much of something huge, Nakajima fell silent.The way he broke off suggested he had said as much as he could, as much as he wanted to.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I was used to this by now.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t know where it came from, but I had grasped the outlines.After a long pause, he continued.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I think it’d be great if we could share an apartment, and meals.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Since this is my idea, we don’t even have to go halvsies.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’ll cover what you can’t.”“Halvsies.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I haven’t heard that word in a while,” I said, changing the topic for a moment.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Then, “I have the money my mom left me, so I think I could probably afford it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m sure my dad would help out, too.”Nakajima nodded.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“After all, when your mom passed away, your dad inherited that club of hers, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
You have every right to ask him for a little money.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sometimes asking a favor is the best way to show your love, don’t you think?”He had a point there, too, though I’d been trying not to think about that.“You’re too cavalier about money, Chihiro.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Just not in the usual way.”It tickled me to have Nakajima lecturing me on practical matters.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I grinned.Lately, he was starting to speak more and more freely, in words that came from deep inside him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And that made me happy.I’d do anything to help him keep moving in that direction.I was even willing to go see my dad, and be pleasant.One afternoon, my good buddy Yotchan came over to the wall with his friend Miki to bring me a snack.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Rice crackers, potato chips, and chocolate.“See, with all this color they’re not ghosts anymore, are they?” I said.The design was almost finished, and I spent my days staring at it, adding a bit of color here and there and redoing parts to make it more balanced.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I was at the stage when all the different parts gradually begin to come together, to form a world of their own.“Poor ghosts,” Yotchan said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“They still look lonely.”“Don’t talk like that!,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
You’re scaring me!” Miki cried.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I hate ghosts.”“Even if they’re monkeys?” I asked.I guess even with the color, their loneliness still shines through.“Yeah.”“I’ve never seen a real lake,” Yotchan said.“I have.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I saw Lake Ashi,” Miki said.I listened to their conversation, marveling at its novelty.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"At the same time, I was thinking to myself that I had failed, they still looked like ghosts.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The kids could see that somehow they were different from the other monkeys.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Although if I was able to express those kinds of things, maybe I wasn’t such a bad painter after all.…After that, Yotchan and Miki started talking about some TV show, and I went on painting in the colors.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They were in the way, but even so I was glad they had come.When I glanced back, they were squatting down eating the snacks they had brought, along with some manjū Sayuri had handed out, chattering back and forth.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I took a swig of hot herbal tea from my thermos and tried to think of some way I could capture the brilliance of their exchanges, the colors that glittered in their words.My butt felt cold from sitting on the ground and my sides hurt from having my arms up in the air for so long, but I couldn’t stop painting.With each color I added, another rose up before me, and I would keep chasing them, one after the other, until the sun set and I couldn’t paint anymore, and then I’d go home and sleep like a log.Now when I thought of home, Nakajima was part of the picture.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He was always studying, and always stayed in my apartment, whether or not I was there.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I guess he really must want to be with me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He came over because he wanted to.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I could believe that, I felt, more than I ever could have with anyone else.Wherever Nakajima is, that’s the place I go home to.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s what lets me go all day without thinking about anything.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"About what I’m going to do with my life, stuff like that.Eventually the kids left, and I was taking a break, pleased with the progress I’d made today, when Sayuri appeared, making a beeline for me, her expression glum.She’d always smiled and waved when I saw her before, so I waited, wondering what was up.“Do you have a minute, Chihiro?” she said.“Doesn’t look like it’s good news,” I said.They must have decided to tear down the center, I thought, even with the mural here.In fact, it was a somewhat trickier problem.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Something that gave me pause.“We got a call from the district mayor, he says they’ve got a sponsor.”“A sponsor?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I thought the district was paying for this!”“The thing is, they were talking things over, and apparently this sponsor says that if it will help energize the district he’s willing to assume the entire cost.”“That’s odd.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It doesn’t seem necessary at this point,” I said.Sayuri nodded.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I know.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The catch is that he wants you to work his company’s logo into the picture somehow, as big as possible.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
You know that sign on the roof of the huge kon’nyaku factory near the turnoff for the highway?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s it.”Sayuri showed me a picture.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was the most bizarre logo you could imagine: an incredibly ugly combination of colors, mostly gray, with the company mascot in the middle.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The mascot was a block of kon’nyaku with a smiley face.“Oh, my god!” I laughed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“You’ve got to be kidding!”Sayuri burst out laughing, too.We were both well aware that in this society, things you’d think could only be bad jokes actually happen all the time.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And so, wiping away a few tears after my laughter had subsided, I told her, “There’s no way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I mean, I’ve practically finished the design.”Even as I spoke, I was trying to think of some way to incorporate a humorous take on the logo into the mural, but it really didn’t seem possible.And I had a sneaking suspicion that even if it were possible, the sponsor wouldn’t like it if I made a joke of his logo.“At any rate, I’ll try and negotiate,” Sayuri said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Don’t lose hope.”This sounded like it could get annoying.“Listen, why don’t I just quit, someone else can finish it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"With the logo,” I suggested.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Or you can find someone to design a whole new picture around the logo.”“Why do you always have to be so absolute about things?” Sayuri said, stunned.So I had to try again.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“How about this, then: I’ll have to put the name of the district in as a sponsor over my signature, so why don’t just we add the logo there, too, very small?”“The president of the company wants it bigger, as part of the picture,” Sayuri said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“But if it’s going to end up being an ad, there’s really no point in having you paint it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Right now I’m threatening them, telling them it will cost a million yen to redo the whole picture.”Sayuri grinned.I like her when she’s like that, so I tried to be as gentle as I could, so that I wouldn’t sound like I was just being picky.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“To tell the truth, I don’t think my pictures are particularly great.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And I’ve been painting this one knowing that it might well be destroyed sometime in the not-too-distant future.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But there’s a huge difference between not saying you won’t paint anything because it might be destroyed and saying sure, anything goes because it might be destroyed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I may not be much of a painter, but I don’t just do any old thing, like someone doing hand-painted movie posters.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Whenever someone offers me a job, I only take it under the condition that I can paint what I want—and I think I’m able, maybe only barely able but still able, to create murals that justify that freedom.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So for someone to come along, just like that, and … it doesn’t matter what it is, no matter how cute the kon’nyaku character is, or if it’s Pikachu or Gandam or Hamtaro—I don’t care, if someone is telling me to put something like that into a mural of mine, it means they didn’t understand my work when they hired me.”“I understand that, I really do.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s the whole reason I wanted you to take this on, and I take full responsibility for everything that’s happening, so you don’t have to worry.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I just came to fill you in, not to try to persuade you.”Like the good teacher she was, Sayuri kept calm and inspired trust.“At any rate, if this turns out to be an inflexible demand, I can’t do it, I can’t work in a system like that,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“It’s totally wrong.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
They’re asking the wrong person.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Tell them they ought to ask a sign-painter for stuff like that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m not disrespecting sign painters, by the way—it’s just a different profession.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I know I’m only a step or two above an amateur, but I can’t switch professions for something like this.”I looked at the mural.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Poor monkeys.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You may end up being painted over, painted out of existence.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
But who knows?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Maybe Yotchan and his friends will remember that you were here, even if only for a short time.The thought liberated me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt as if the things I’d been clinging to were crumbling, blowing away in the wind, dispersing.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Leaving me free to go anywhere I wanted.This is nice, I thought, really nice.I figured I might as well take a picture, anyway, and snapped a shot with my digital camera, with the sky as the background.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"To preserve the joy of this special stage in the painting.“I’m sure there’s a way,” Sayuri said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“For starters, I’m planning to show the video of that TV program you were in to the people in the mayor’s office, and from the company.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ll try and make them see how valuable this is as art.”“Kind of embarrassing, considering the quality of my work,” I said.For the first time, though, I was beginning to take what I was doing a tiny bit seriously.It was hard to say for sure since the president of the company hadn’t seen the mural yet, but I had to acknowledge that some of the responsibility for what might happen lay with me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I just wasn’t good enough to paint a picture no one would want to mess up with a logo.It’d be nice to study painting more, to see all kinds of really, really incredible artworks and realize just how minuscule I am.… All on its own, the path to Paris was opening up before me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I pictured Nakajima in profile, engrossed in his studies at home.I wanted to be able to have that same look on my face when I painted.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Not to run away from everything that had happened in a day, but to turn it all into another form of energy, make it part of myself.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s how I wanted my painting to be.But first I’d have to finish what I had started here.“Okay, and I’ll do my best to get featured in a magazine or something, to make myself at least a little more visible,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Middle-aged men are impressed by that kind of thing, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And I can ask the professor who advised me on my thesis project to write the mayor a letter—she’s a pretty well-known artist, and she’s from the area, so I bet her opinion will carry a lot of weight.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She’s the one who did that weird bronze sculpture in front of the train station, I think.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And on top of that, I’ll send a letter to the president of the company, along with some materials about the mural, making it as conciliatory and pleasant as possible, to try and bring him around.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If that doesn’t work, we’ll just have to give up.”I thought it was a splendid plan.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Unless he were incredibly wealthy and eccentric, the president probably wouldn’t want to pay to have me erase a mural I had gone to all the trouble of painting and then do another one.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt confident it would work.“I bet that’ll do the trick,” Sayuri said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I’m sorry, putting you to so much trouble.”“That’s okay.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ll give it a try.”After all, I thought, maybe this will be my last job in Japan.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I wasn’t necessarily determined to go on working as a muralist, so I really had no idea what the future might hold.Things like this were bound to happen no matter what kind of life I ended up leading, and whether they turned out well or badly, I’d just have to do my best, the way I would this time.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And inhale the sweet scent of the freedom I’d earned when it came wafting over.“Let me know when something’s been decided,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I’ll take a break until then, once I get to a stopping place.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s okay, I know it’s not your fault.”I had things to do, and I needed to cool down, and it made me sad to look at the picture when it was so close to being done, so I hurriedly packed up my stuff.Of course I wasn’t angry.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt bad for Sayuri, actually.It was only natural that they felt entitled to order me around—it’s not like I was a famous artist or anything.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And I’m not a particularly imposing person, either: they probably assumed I’d just go right along with their request that I work an ad into my painting.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I saw that.In a way, it really made sense.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That kind of willingness to give in is rampant in this society of ours.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"From banks to ponzu sauce … well, those are just examples.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The point is that people have found a gazillion little opportunities to profit in questionable ways, all over the place.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ve seen tons of cases, all across the board, where in order to grab on to those tiny profits people studiously adopt another perspective, keeping their true opinions to themselves, and no one takes responsibility, everyone just huddles together on some middle ground, and it all gets less and less clear, yet in the end everyone ends up being crammed into a rigid, unyielding framework.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’ve seen the same story play out over and over again.But I couldn’t take it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The whole dumb setup just bored me to death.Here I am playing nicely with the world, trying my best to leave things the tiniest bit better than they were, trying to fly even a little bit higher—how annoying it would be to have to go along with this crap.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That was my take on it.If I were Sayuri, for instance, and the Infant Development Center mattered more to me than anything else, and if I were part of the organization, I’m sure I could have found all kinds of solutions to their problems, and I would have gone with the policy that was best for everyone.But in the current situation, going along with this new proposal would have gone against the essence of my profession.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If I were a stranger passing through this district and I happened to see this wall and the ad were part of the mural, I’d think it was pathetic.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Besides, I have to say I don’t think much of a company that feels it has to have its name plastered all over the place simply because it’s shelling out five hundred thousand yen.Right now five hundred thousand yen is a huge amount of money to me, but that doesn’t mean I’ll just do whatever it takes to be paid.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Especially not something like abandoning my professional standards, because that would throw the rest of my life out of balance.All this reminded me of an incident involving a sculptor I respect.This sculptor had been asked to create a sculpture for a plaza in a certain town in Europe.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"In the place where the plaza then stood there had once been a forest inhabited by gypsies, large numbers of whom had died during some war.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
So he suggested he make a statue showing gypsies.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He was thinking of all the terrible discrimination gypsies have suffered.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"An open area like the plaza was, he thought, the perfect place to commemorate a population that had been subjected to the evils of the human spirit, whose true story had always been concealed, consigned to oblivion.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But the mayor and the citizens of the town refused to go along—there were still gypsies, they said, who grabbed purses and picked pockets and generally made themselves a nuisance to tourists—people like them didn’t deserve to be celebrated with a statue.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And so the whole project was indefinitely put on hold.That’s how it goes.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Things look different depending on your perspective.As I see it, fighting to bridge those gaps isn’t what really matters.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The most important thing is to know them inside and out, as differences, and to understand why certain people are the way they are.My job was to insist on my own perspective, right to the end, and in order to do that I needed to brush up on my technique.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"However famous you may be, these disagreements are bound to continue, and ultimately it doesn’t really matter that I’m not that much of a painter.Well, maybe it does.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If I had more confidence, it’d be easier to hold my own.That’s the crucial thing.The truth, sad to say, is that I still can’t declare with any real conviction that the people of this town would be better off with my mural on the wall rather than that goofy logo.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s the problem, I thought with a twinge of shame: I’m still too young, too green.Returning early to the apartment, I found Nakajima studying madly, his PowerBook open and a dictionary in his hand.“Early, aren’t you?” he said.“I got stuff for dinner,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“No need to make anything.”I didn’t particularly need to say that, but that’s what came out.“Oh?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I was looking forward to making dinner again today.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s a nice way to take a break,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“How about I go and get us some coffee from that place where they roast the beans themselves?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It would be nice to talk a walk.” Then, looking me in the face for the first time, “Oh, looks like something bad happened today.”I nodded and told him what had happened.“Yeah, it’s not surprising, given your low level of celebrity and how unsophisticated people are in that part of the city,” Nakajima said.“You don’t mince words, do you?” I said, impressed.“If you don’t say what you’re thinking, you end up lying when you really need to speak up,” Nakajima said.“Anyhow, I can’t draw a stupid kon’nyaku logo into my picture.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I just can’t.”“Did you see what it looks like?”“I did.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It’s this kon’nyaku mascot with a weird blob of words above it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Very uncool.”“Could you stick it in a corner somewhere, really small?”“That would be fine with me, but the sponsor said it has to be big.”“That’s something they would have had to make clear from the beginning.”“You’re telling me.”“And even if your picture is still a work in progress, it’s like a sapling that will eventually grow into a huge tree or something—it has that kind of glow.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They’ve got to see that.”“More plain speaking from Nakajima … I mean, even I don’t see that kind of value in my murals yet.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s why I have no problem painting in a place that could be torn down.”“I know, but your modest assessment of your own worth and the decision to treat your work like a billboard are two totally different things.”“I’m with you there.”“Besides, they hired you to do a job.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They can’t keep changing their minds about what that job is.”“Exactly.”“How about telling them you’ll quit unless they agree to have the logo at the edge, very small?”“That’s what I thought.”“Do you have any connections?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Professors at the art school, say, or some famous art critic?”“A few.”“Have them say something.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It helps to fight authority with authority, I think.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And if you could get someone to come do a story about your work, write an article that would give meaning to your mural or something, that would make your position stronger, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And if you should end up in court or something, who cares?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sayuri can decide for herself where she stands.” Nakajima paused a moment, then continued.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“See, people like us are never at the center of things.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We’re always on the margins, and I generally figure it’s best not to stand out too much.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Most of the time we see things in exactly the opposite light as the majority does, and people don’t look kindly on you if you stand out.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When push comes to shove, though, you’ve got to have something you won’t cave in on.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Otherwise, you end up like a recluse or something, cut off from the world.”Our opinions were so close I felt as if he were reading my mind.The amazing alignment of our perspectives made me forget how annoyed I’d been at the prospect of having to stop painting and go to all this trouble doing irrelevant things.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That feeling faded so quickly it was like magic.When something unpleasant happened during the day, I used to come home and pet my cat to cheer myself up.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Being with Nakajima seemed to have a similar effect, neutralizing the poison that had accumulated inside me.My old self would probably have come in without saying a word and tried to forget it all by having sex with whoever I was sleeping with just then, not talking to him about what had happened, keeping everything bottled up inside.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That shows you how much respect I had for my lovers.But Nakajima was different, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"This time it was for real.At this very moment, I was truly beginning to fall in love.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It weighed on me and it was sometimes a pain in the ass, but the payoff could be big, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
So big it felt like gazing up into the sky.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Or like looking out an airplane window at the ocean, with clouds shining above it.It was so gorgeous it almost felt like sadness.Like the feeling you get when you realize that, in the grand scheme of things, your time here on this earth really isn’t all that long after all.There was one other thing I had to do.“Hey, Dad, I’m at the station now.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Do you have some time today?”I didn’t want to call him at work, so I’d called his cell phone.“Wow, this is sudden,” my dad said.“Well, the job I had scheduled sort of stopped unexpectedly,” I replied.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“It’s hard for me to get out here unless something like that happens.”“I can get away for a while in the evening,” my dad said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“We could have dinner in about two hours.”The restaurant my dad chose was this incredibly mediocre Italian place, and whenever he went there his Prominent Local Personage thing went into high gear.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I couldn’t stand it.But I’d asked to see him without any warning, and of course he’d be treating me, so I figured I had no right to complain.With a family as stable as mine had been, my heart certainly wasn’t scarred, or if it was, the scars were ones I’d made myself—now that I was comparing myself to Nakajima all the time I could see that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I thought I was pretty tough, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Still, I cried a bit at the station.The days I’d passed with my mom before she died were still there, it seemed, seared into the corners of my heart.The atmosphere of the station brought it all back.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I could see myself running to the hospital, glad to be seeing my mother again.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
You never know you’re happy until later.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because physical sensations like smells and exhaustion don’t figure into our memories, I guess.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Only the good bits bob up into view.I was always startled by the snatches of memory that I saw as happy, how they came.This time, it was the feeling I got when I stepped out onto the platform.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The sense of what it had been like to be on my way to see my mom, for her still to be alive, if only for the time being, if only for that day.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The happiness of that knowledge had come back to life inside me.And the loneliness of that moment.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The helplessness.The fact that now when I came to this station, I could go see my dad, but not my mom.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’d always done that in the past, but now I couldn’t.“You know, the chef in this place spent four whole years in Italy!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Seriously.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Hey, kid, do me a favor and ask Sugiyama to come say hi when he has a moment, will you?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I want to introduce him to my daughter.”Just as I expected: he’d said it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"In my heart I was thinking, Please, I’ve already heard that story, and how could he “have a moment” when he’s got a restaurant full of customers?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I kept quiet.Before long a man in a tall chef’s hat came out and talked for a while with my dad, and he said hello to me, too, so I just kept smiling away.I’d be leaving Japan soon, after all, and probably wouldn’t be seeing my dad for a while.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When I thought about that, I felt kind of attached even to his preening.After that the dishes started coming out: huge quantities of pasta that had obviously been boiled too long, especially considering that the chef had lived in Italy for four years, and tiny servings of the main courses.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I suppose he must have ended up adapting to the tastes of his customers out here in the country—he didn’t have any choice.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’d met some exchange students from Italy when I was in art school, and I had made a few super-low-budget trips to the towns they had come from.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Needless to say, none of the restaurants in Italy had been as half-hearted in their approach as this one.As I thought back fondly over those days, I began to realize with more and more clarity that I was seriously on the verge of going to Europe.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And I was going there for myself.“Listen, Dad,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I’m thinking of going to study in Paris next year.”“With a guy, I take it?” He didn’t miss a beat.I was stunned.“What makes you think that?” I asked.“I can see it in your face,” he replied.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“You look ready to be a mom.”“Do I?”I smiled.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Maybe I was more giddy than I realized.“Anyway, it sounds good to me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It’s great you’re even able to consider it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Bring him to see me before you go, though, will you?”“Well, if I can,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“You’ll have to wait a bit.”Nakajima was too weird, not the kind of guy you introduce to your family.“What does he do?” my dad asked.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“Don’t tell me he wants to be a painter.”“No.”“He’s younger than you?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
A student?” my dad said.I was impressed at how close to the truth he was.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Parents are amazing.“He’s in med school.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We’re the same age, but he is a student.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He wants to get a scholarship to study at this research institute in Paris when he finishes his degree.”“I suspected there was a man behind this.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Can’t say I like it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Not a bit.”He seemed genuinely displeased.“Terrible, getting me to confess it all.” I smiled.“Well, once you’ve settled on an art school in Paris, send me a breakdown of all the funds you’ll need.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And promise you’ll come visit me sometimes.”“Oh, I won’t need anything—I’ve got the money Mom left,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“And you don’t have to give me anything to get me to come visit.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Of course I’ll come!,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You should come see me in Paris, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And to tell the truth, you’re the only one I want to see.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’d rather not have to see your relatives anymore, honestly.”“No, I don’t like it when you have to spend time with my sister and the rest of that crowd, either,” my dad said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“I hate seeing you unhappy.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But please—if I do send you some money, don’t turn it down, okay?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And if anything should happen, let me know.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Definitely.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If you get hurt, or pregnant, or you break up with this guy and start living on your own, or you quit school … any big change.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Tell me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And if you can manage it, introduce him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Anytime is fine.”“Okay.”Thank you, Dad, I thought, chewing my mushy pasta.My relationship with him had entered a new phase.You don’t necessarily have to want to become an adult; it happens as a matter of course, as you go, making choices.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The important thing, I think, is to choose for yourself.Standing next to my dad, I realized that his body no longer smelled like a middle-aged man’s.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"All of a sudden, he smelled like a grandfather.That’s what happens when you live apart.We’ll probably never live under the same roof again.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The second that thought struck me, days that had seemed utterly unremarkable were made irreplaceable, unforgettable.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I came face-to-face, once more, with a time I had left behind.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"My dad had been part of the life I’d lived then, he was woven indistinguishably into the fabric, with exactly the same color thread.But life keeps flowing on.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Maybe if his business failed and he went bankrupt and everyone in this town abandoned him, he and I might end up living near each other.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If I were somehow to become extraordinarily wealthy, say, and I rented an apartment for him to live in.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was no way that would happen, I knew that, but daydreaming alleviated my jealousy.The jealousy I felt, after my mom died, at losing my dad to this town.Deep inside me, the child I used to be is crying.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Weren’t you supposed to drop everything else and just be my dad, after Mom died?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"How can you go on running the same company, as if nothing has happened, and go on hanging out with those relatives of yours?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
What did all the time we spent together as a family mean to you?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Was it just a game for you, playing at our being a family?But the adult I’ve become wants her freedom, and the truth is that I wouldn’t like it at all if my dad actually thrust himself into my life.And so, like a man and a woman secretly in love, we remain silent about the half-wish we each feel, that somehow we could live together.I guess this is one way to love, I think.Love isn’t only a matter of fussing over each other, hugging, wanting to be together.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Some things communicate, inevitably, precisely because you keep them in check.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The heartfelt feelings that find their way to you in the form of money and imported gourmet ham.Having the sensitivity to gauge those things is a real gift.Our negotiating strategies seemed to have worked, because things went well.I managed to have the interview take place just in time to meet the deadline for a certain magazine’s next issue.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The timing was perfect: people who saw the article started coming to watch while I was still working on the mural, and the fact that it was featured in a magazine seems to have convinced people in the neighborhood that my work must have value, even if did look like a child’s doodling.The letter I’d written and the recommendation from my art school professor had been delivered to the president of the kon’nyaku company, and he’d come to take a look at the site where I was painting the mural.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He was extremely pleased to see it was the center of so much activity, and he decided that it would be a shame to ruin the picture; it would be good enough just to put the logo somewhere at the edge.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I lucked out because he was a pleasant man: he had broad shoulders, and looked sort of like a block of kon’nyaku himself.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He asked me to mention the company when the local newspaper and a cable TV station came to interview me after the mural was completed.I didn’t really care one way or the other as long as the picture could be saved, so naturally I smiled good-naturedly and agreed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sayuri, who had gotten the knack of managing things like this through the process of negotiating and arranging my painting schedule and so on, told me that if she ever lost her job she would come and be my agent.“So it looks like I’ll be able to finish the mural after all.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Everything went beautifully.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Thanks again, Nakajima.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I really appreciate your standing by me,” I said.We were at a homey teishoku restaurant near the apartment.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I was having ginger pork.“So it worked, that’s great!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I figured it would.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We’re surrounded by all these bozos who don’t know the difference between a mural and an advertisement, after all.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They’re bound to have a weakness for mass media stars.”There he goes again, being a bit too frank.Something in his bluntness reminded me of Chii.“I bet that’s true anywhere, no matter what country you’re in,” I said.“I’m not so sure about that,” Nakajima replied, taking a bite of his boiled mackerel set.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“It might be easier if you were dealing with people who see historically significant architecture and incredible paintings on church ceilings and so on every day.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I don’t know much about art, so I really have no idea how great those things are, but I’m really looking forward to seeing a lot once we’re in Paris.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I get the feeling that in countries with that kind of history, even researchers will take a different attitude toward their work—just thinking about it makes my heart pound.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I won’t even be able to compete, I bet, in all kinds of areas.”“I feel the same way,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“In Paris, I’ll be able to spend as much time as I want looking at paintings of the sort I’d have to line up to see for just fifteen seconds at the museums in Ueno Park.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There’s simply no comparison in the quantity of what’s available.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And I’ll be able to see as many paintings in churches as I want.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"After all, I’m most interested in frescos.… If I have a chance, I’d love to learn about restoration, too—there’s so much I want to do!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s all there for me to study, from now on.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I owe that to you: it’s only after we met that I’ve started wanting so badly to go and learn more about the things I’m interested in.”The restaurant was packed with students and single men; there was a baseball game on TV.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Waiters bustled back and forth, calling out one order after another.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We hardly ever ate out, so it all seemed very novel.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt dazzled looking at everyone, like a mole fresh out of its tunnel.I had suggested to Nakajima that I take him out to eat, even though we never ate out, because I wanted to thank him for being there for me during my troubles with the mural.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He grudgingly came along, saying that maybe it would be nice to go out for a change.Having dinner at a local teishoku place, for the first time in ages … that’s all we were doing.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Back when I was on my own, this scene would have been drearily familiar.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But since every little opinion Nakajima offered was linked to a whole other universe, the ordinariness of it all melted away, affording me glimpses of the unknown.“The thing that concerns me,” Nakajima said, “is that people might start offering you lots more jobs now that you’re getting a little more famous, and then you won’t be interested in going to Paris anymore.”He kept his eyes down as he said this.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He carefully picked the small clams out of his miso soup, one at a time, and popped them into his mouth.“If I did get offered a job, I’d certainly go anywhere in Japan to do it, as long as that were possible, right until the last minute.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I want to earn money that way as long as I can,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“But I’m going to Paris.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"My life with you is important to me, and I want to be overwhelmed, too, while I’m still not too old.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I want to be blown away by greatness.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because I’ve started wanting to become a better person, now, even just a little bit better.”“I’m glad of that,” Nakajima said.He had a habit, when he was truly happy, of not showing it.We sound like a married couple, I thought.Playing at marriage, playing at being a dad, playing at being a full member of society.Everything in my life revolves around people playing at being something.But that’s only because we have to be that way in order to get on with our lives.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Just because people are playing doesn’t mean their hearts aren’t in it.The schedule was pretty tight, and I ended up staying pretty late a few times, but at last I finished the mural.Sayuri and the center’s director and I took a photo to mark the occasion, and, as promised, I made a special point of highlighting the name of the kon’nyaku company and thanking it for its support in an interview with the local paper and on TV.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We took another picture with the children from the center, with whom I’d become good friends, as if we had all gone camping together or something, and then they took me to a yakiniku place to celebrate.After it was all over, in the middle of the night, I climbed over the gate and snuck onto the grounds all alone, and went to stand in front of the mural.Maybe it was because I’d just finished it, but it looked really terrific.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was the best of all my works to date.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was a boldness to it that defied the darkness, even when no one was there to see it.At last, a faint sense of confidence dropped anchor inside me.Now, I thought, I’m free to leave.The monkeys in the picture dashed around like they had no time to waste.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Little blasts of color radiated out, one overlapping with another, merging, like a rainbow.And then my eye landed on those two monkeys, one drinking tea and one in her bed, and something inside me shimmered.Maybe I should go see them.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"By myself … yeah, I’ll go see Mino and his sister.I’d take along a picture of this mural to show them, and talk to Chii.I was trying to remember what train line we had taken, where we changed, what that lake had been called, when all of a sudden I remembered what Yotchan had said.Ghosts.And I began to wonder.Maybe that place never existed, it was all a figment of Nakajima’s imagination.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Could it be that the two of them, Mino and Chii, were no longer living?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That Yotchan had been right?I shuddered.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That seemed so much more likely than that it had been real.I’m a pretty practical person, and ordinarily there’s no way I’d even consider such a thing, but … somehow the notion seemed oddly right.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt like I was lost, body and all, in a fog of memories, and the feeling refused to dissipate.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Nakajima had the power to make you lose sight of the boundary between what you had actually experienced and what you hadn’t—maybe it wasn’t real, after all.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Maybe in the end Nakajima’s whole existence was aiming somewhere else, not toward the light but away from it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I got that feeling somehow.I was comfortable with him, and to a certain degree I was in love, so it hadn’t bothered me, but I couldn’t help noticing that there was something in him that scared me every so often.Or maybe that’s necessary when two people are serious about each other?We try our hardest not to feel that, to sweep it under the carpet, but I bet it’s there.A particular variety of loneliness, like peering deep into the darkness.It’s only natural, when two separate universes touch.For instance, when I was a child I saw a lot of vomit, middle-aged women totally drunk with their bras cutting into the flesh of their backs, and even middle-aged men running their eyes lasciviously over my young body—I was used to it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And that was only the beginning.… It wasn’t hard for me to imagine a world out there in which murder was an everyday occurrence.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That wasn’t my world, and it wasn’t the world my parents had lived in, but somewhere, anywhere, all you had to do was peel away the skin, and you’d discover a path leading down into it.Everyone knows that hidden pull is there, but we go on living our lives, pretending we don’t.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We keep our gazes fixed, day after day, on the things we want to see.But sometimes we encounter people like Nakajima who compel us to remember it all.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He doesn’t have to say or do anything in particular; just looking at him, you find yourself face-to-face with the enormousness of the world as a whole.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Because he doesn’t try to live in just a part of it.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because he doesn’t avert his gaze.He makes me feel like I’ve suddenly awakened, and I want to go on watching him forever.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That, I think, is what it is.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m awed by his terrible depths.A few days later, in the morning, I set out for that town.Stepping down from the train alone this time, the station seemed even more forlorn than it had the first time.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The only sign of life in the dead of the afternoon was the supermarket, whose huge electric sign glowed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It seemed to suck people in: elderly men and women, prematurely aged housewives.I kept walking on and on along the single street that extended from the station and found the road that led to the lake.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The breeze carried the scent of water.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Passing a small boathouse, a run-down shop that sold fishing tackle, and a closed restaurant, I emerged from the woods onto the shore of the lake.I cared for Nakajima so deeply that I was shaking.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I felt it even more in his absence.Last time, when we had walked here together, the lake had been more beautiful than it was now, and shone more brilliantly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I guess I must have been in love already.The lake, utterly still now, seemed to have been abandoned by the world and its goings-on.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was no mist yet; the sunlight beat down almost painfully on the bare tree branches.I kept walking, heading for the red torii.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"My footsteps were uncertain, as if I were walking in a dream.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"What if it’s just a ruin when I get there, empty for the past hundred years?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I thought.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I wouldn’t have been surprised if it were.So I was relieved when the small house came into view.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Relieved, and stunned.Because Mino was standing in the doorway, waving.I ran over.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“How on earth …” I said.“Chii said you’d be coming, alone this time,” Mino said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I was out here waiting.”“It’s amazing she knows these things,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“And that you would have such faith in her that you’d come out and wait for me, like a little dog or something.”Without thinking, I patted Mino on the head.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He had the most adorably dog-like round eyes to begin with, and for him to be perched on the stoop like this … it was so cute I could hardly stand it.“I’m not a dog.” Mino smiled.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“Come on inside.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’ll make us some tea.”I smiled back and followed him through the door.Relief washed over me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
They exist.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It wasn’t a dream.If anything, it was Nakajima’s bizarre mood that had made them seem unreal.The house was just as tidy as before, and yet it felt homey.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Somehow you always get that sense when you visit someplace for the second time, and that’s how it was here, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
This was a place I could relax in.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And now I knew my way around.I sat back and watched Mino as he boiled water and made tea.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There wasn’t anything unusual about the way he did these things, but his movements were very precise.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He took his time, but he wasn’t dawdling.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was like watching a master at the tea ceremony.“It’s no use trying to steal my technique.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s all in the spring water.”Mino smiled.“Maybe I’ll take some when I go.”“I’ll show you where later,” Mino said.The tea, made from leaves with a subtly smoky aroma, was so good I could feel my senses sharpening.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It had a sweetness to it, and at the end of each sip I’d catch a whiff of fruit.“It’s delicious.…” I murmured.“Life sure is funny,” Mino said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Ordinarily I don’t go out much—I order most of what we need, books and tea leaves and so on, online.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The supermarket in front of the station is really the only place I go.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The weird thing is, while I never feel any desire to see other people, I get all happy when someone tells me they like the tea I make.”“Maybe you just know I recognize good tea when I drink it?” I said.“That could be,” Mino said.I sort of knew what he meant.I’m sure that if I hadn’t been a friend of Nakajima’s, if I were a traveler who just happened to run into Mino on the road, or a tourist in the area who randomly dropped by this shack, he wouldn’t have opened his heart to me the way he did.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
We wouldn’t have been able to talk this intimately.Mino and Nakajima were a lot alike in that way.They weren’t casual about things the way normal people are.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They didn’t see any reason to try and be amiable with people just because they happened to be there.Maybe in a sense their way of doing things was kind of sad, but it put me at ease.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because it’s normal.In most cases, relationships fall into place the second you figure out who someone is and once you have a grasp of the context that led to your meeting them.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"For Mino and Nakajima, though, that process was all messed up.Think of those kids at the center.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
They’re honest but cautious; they would never come plop themselves down beside me and start asking questions right from the first day.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It always takes at least a week before kids start pestering me and getting excited.I’ve got more experience with life than they do, it’s true, and sometimes as I paint I start thinking, Look, ultimately we’re going to get friendly anyway, and once I finish painting I’ll be gone.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
So why don’t you hurry up and come over?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
What’s the point in waiting?But just because you’re working within a fixed time frame like that doesn’t mean you can just leap over the distance that separates you.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The kids, in this case, are right.I could relax with Mino because he didn’t seem to have any extra baggage, and I sensed that over time, little by little, we would become friendly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was the same as with the kids.It’s more than just a matter of words—there’s always a physical distance to overcome.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We look each other in the eye, smell the air, drink our tea together, gathering up tiny sparks of reassurance.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And then there’s the matter of affinity.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"If Nakajima had attempted to decrease the distance between us two weeks earlier than he had, I bet I would have been turned off.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I probably never would have cried as I had, touched at the sight of his wire rack.“I feel like this could become a habit—taking the train here, making my way around the lake, coming here for a delicious cup of tea,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Would it be all right if I visited occasionally, Mino, with Nakajima?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Not to have my fortune told, just to come.”“Yes,” Mino said quietly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Maybe then our stopped time would move again.”The stopped time, I realized, was Nakajima’s, too.“Quite a hero, aren’t you?” Mino said in Chii’s voice.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Mino’s eyes were closed.Chii’s eyes, too, were closed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She was asleep, breathing lightly, her chest rising and falling slightly under the fluffy comforter that covered her.“Wouldn’t I be a heroine?”This time, no longer unnerved by her sarcasm, I could be myself.I could totally see why Nakajima had wanted to see them so badly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Basically, they were really nice, interesting people.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They had managed to build something like a solid, healthy household on a foundation that was seriously skewed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Here, keeping to themselves, they treasured certain elements of life, like restraint and dignity, that people in the city had long since abandoned.“No, Nobu’s the heroine of the story,” Chii said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“The damsel in distress.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You saved him from the prison he’d shut himself up inside, you woke him up and brought him out.”I sort of knew what she meant.“Go to Paris with him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You two may well end up living there for quite some time, but do it anyway,” Chii said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“You seem to be hesitating, but isn’t it too late for that?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He’s grabbed you.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And you’ve grabbed him, too—he can’t live by himself anymore.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I think I can show you an image that will make you understand.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Here, give me your hand.”Looking at Chii, I saw that she had opened her eyes.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The color of her eyes was so deep I shuddered.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t want to touch her, but I figured that was just my instincts telling me to steer clear of anything too powerful.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And since I had come this far, why not?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Screwing up my courage, I took her hand in mine.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was smooth, and very thin.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The hand of a sleeping beauty who had nothing to do with ordinary life.“Close your eyes,” Chii said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“Match your breathing with mine.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It seems like hypnotism, I know, and in a way it’s sort of similar, but it’s not hypnotism.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
We’re simply going to share an image.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Don’t be afraid.”I did just as she told me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The dark screen in front of my eyes was blank.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But after a while, as I waited, absolutely still, an image rose up in my mind.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"All at once, just like that.It was snowing.… In a dark sky, like motes of dust, like bird feathers pirouetting in the air, ever so lightly, snow was drifting this way and that.I was looking down on the snow from above.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I could tell because the flakes kept tumbling away from me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Then, all of a sudden, I was up in a tree somewhere, watching the street below.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Gradually, I realized that the tree was just one in a row that lined the street.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was an ordinary paved street; no sooner had the snowflakes landed on it than they melted.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The only place they were starting to pile up, in a thin layer, was on the roofs of the cars parked along the street.I saw Nakajima in the distance, walking toward me, a heavy-looking backpack full of books on his shoulder.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I could tell it had books in it because of the neat, square way it bulged.Hey, it’s Nakajima!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Just look at him, he’s so cool!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I thought automatically.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The way he stoops over like that, the long toes in those shoes of his—I love it all.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s not logical.Looking more closely as he approached, I noticed that he seemed to have lost weight and he looked pale and unsteady on his feet.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He must have been studying nonstop again, without taking a break to eat.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"As if he were trying, by studying, to free himself from something.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Then, without any warning, he stopped and looked up.I doubt our eyes could have met then, since I was transparent.He slumped down on the ground and leaned against the tree.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was no one else around, just the snow dancing lightly in the air.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Nakajima was watching the snow.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
His eyes were lovely.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His face wore the expression of someone confronted by something wonderful.Then Nakajima opened his backpack and slipped an object awkwardly out from between the books that did, indeed, fill the backpack almost to the bursting point.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was that old wire rack.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He put it under his arm like a thermometer and closed his eyes.“No!,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Don’t go to sleep there!,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You’ll freeze!” I screamed.The sound of my own screaming jolted me into consciousness.Chii was still holding my hand, her eyes open.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
She was watching me.Once again Mino spoke in Chii’s voice.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“That was a symbolic representation of Nobu’s past, and of his future.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Of what happened to him, and what could happen again.”“I can’t allow that,” I said, tears welling unexpectedly in my eyes.My heart was thumping, just like when I’d dreamed of my mom.“It’s important to remember that it’s not something that actually happened, it’s an allegory.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Though of course it could happen,” Mino said without emotion, just interpreting.But I caught it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The shade of sadness hidden in the glint of Mino’s eye.“All right.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You’ve made your point.”Chii, who had lifted herself up, collapsed heavily back into bed as if she no longer had the energy to sit up.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She shut her eyes.“I bet Paris will be wonderful for you,” Mino said, himself again.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Maybe living there will be even nicer than it is here.”His return indicated that this session was over.“How much?” I asked.“Ten thousand yen,” Mino said.“That doesn’t seem like much,” I said, somewhat taken aback.Judging from the atmosphere, I was sure it would be much more.“We never accept more than that,” Mino said.I glanced over at Chii, planning to thank her, but her eyes were closed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Then, looking more closely, I noticed a photograph of their mother hanging on the wall behind her.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I hadn’t even seen it last time.I could tell she was their mother by the shape of her body: she was kind of small and oddly proportioned, just like them.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
She stared straight out of the picture in its plain white frame.It hit me that I recognized her.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I had seen her on TV.And suddenly I understood everything.“Oh, my god, Mino!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t realize!”He seemed to understand everything I wanted to say.He nodded once.I decided not to say anything more.“I think I should go,” I said, standing up.As I left the room, a feeble, high-pitched voice called, “Good luck.”When I looked back, Chii was still asleep.“I haven’t heard her voice in a long time,” Mino said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I don’t see why she has to use me if she can talk on her own.”“I bet she thinks you need a job, too,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Besides, talking takes energy.”“I guess there’s a reason for me to exist, after all,” Mino said, smiling.“What do mean, a reason!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You matter very much to everyone!” I said earnestly.Mino didn’t reply.His silence was exactly like Nakajima’s, and it hurt to see him like that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He was quiet in the way people are when they believe the world would get along just fine without them.I had one more cup of tea and then stepped outside.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Mino brought out an empty plastic bottle and told me to take some spring water back for Nakajima.Today, small waves rode the surface of the lake.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
There was a light breeze.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The boats looked kind of lonely moored with no one sitting in them, rocking in time to the waves.My mind felt numb, as if I were in an unreal world.The tree branches were swaying slightly, too, hanging out over the lake.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I noticed that they were cherry trees—lots and lots of them.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I pictured the lake when they bloomed, framed by a ring of hazy, whitish pink.“It must be lovely when the cherries are in bloom,” I said.“That’s the most amazing event of the year here,” Mino said.He wasn’t comfortable enough with me to come right out and invite me to visit then, but his manner made me feel as if he had.Then we climbed the old stairway to the shrine, where the spring was.Turning to look back when we reached the top, we were so high that the lake looked like an adorable miniature of itself, ensconced in a ring of greenery.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The boats, lined up in a neat row, were like toy boats.The spring water was cold and tasted slightly salty and hard when I scooped some up and drank it.There was no one in the shrine; the only sound to be heard in the pure, cleanly swept space was the calling of birds.It occurred to me that Nakajima and his mother had probably come here for water every day, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I pictured the two of them then, living their lives, clinging to each other.They were so hurt and they had lost so much that they no longer knew what was what, but the need they felt for each other was still love.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
No one could deny that.Mino spoke.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Perhaps to your eyes, Chihiro, this lake looks like the kind of scenery you’d encounter in a dream—beautiful, ineffable.“But that’s because you saw it for the first time through Nobu’s eyes.“We have all kinds of days here, just like anywhere.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The lake has all sorts of different faces.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And so it’s always fresh.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Some days the sky is clear and the water shines so brightly you can’t even look at it, and it lifts your spirit; some days it’s plastered with boats.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sometimes I’ll just sit staring at the snow melting away into nothing on the surface of the lake, and some days when it’s overcast, even the trees in our garden look dingy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’ll be so hazy that our bicycles look like junk.“The truth is, time hasn’t really stopped for us.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Things are constantly changing, even if the change happens so slowly you don’t notice.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I go to that big supermarket in front of the station and wander around looking like a kid, buying packages of curry rice mix with anime characters on them, collecting coupons.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I buy things like buckets.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Or a toilet brush.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Ordinary stuff.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And I cart it all home on my bike.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
You see that …” Mino pointed to a little general store that was visible a short distance from the lake.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“That store over there.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The man who runs it is part of our neighborhood association, so if we run into each other at the supermarket he gives me a lift in his car.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His relatives are in Shizuoka, and in the winter they send him boxes of mikan.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He brings us a lot, every year.“But we don’t get any friendlier with him than that.“The priest at this shrine is a relative of Nobu’s, but whenever we have business with him we just smile back and forth—we never have meals, or go out together.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It’s extremely rare for Chii and I to really grow close to someone.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"People are afraid of us, because we have a different sort of smell.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And people scare us, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But we’re living our lives, just like everyone.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
We live in this place.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Our lives may be warped, but we live them all the same.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"One day to the next.”“I know,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“And I’m sure that someday Nakajima will realize that, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That you’re not just a part of his past.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He was desperate to see you, even though it hurt him, even though it made him sick just thinking about coming here—but he had to find a way, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s how badly he wanted to see you.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And he’ll realize that if he feels that way, it’s okay, he can come.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I think he’ll come visit more often now.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Now that he’s done it once, he’ll be okay.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
You’ll see more of Nakajima.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"All the time, again and again.”Mino nodded without speaking.Then he said, “I couldn’t say it well earlier when you showed me the pictures, but … thank you.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Thanks for painting us.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Thanks so much for seeing, the first time you met us, that even though we’re like ghosts, the two of us, even though we’re not supposed to exist, we are alive.”I had seen Mino and Chii’s mother on TV ages ago.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
She looked just like them.She was notorious.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
People knew her as a terrible mother.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She had joined a group that had done horrible things, and she had taken her children with her.I don’t remember them having a father.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
They had been born out of wedlock.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Maybe their mother didn’t know who the father was.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
The news was full of all kinds of scandalous reports about her back then.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And if Mino and Chii’s mother was presented as an incarnation of evil, Nakajima’s mother was the incarnation of everything good.Things are never that simple, and I don’t see why it had to be reported that way.I must have been in elementary school at the time.If Nakajima had shown me a photograph of his mother instead of that wire rack, I’m sure I would have recognized her immediately.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He probably knew that, and so he didn’t.Nakajima’s mother was always pleading.“Please return my son to me!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I know he’s alive.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m his mother, I can tell!”Every chance she had, she would be on TV, in magazines, on the radio, at rallies.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She was always there, telling the same story.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Telling people about the day her son was kidnapped.Nakajima was a very bright child—too bright, in fact.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He was a little different from other children.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And so he would go and spend time at a special school.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The school had a summer camp in Izu, and he had been going there, and then one evening he didn’t come back.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Until then, his mother explained, again and again, their family had been perfectly happy, and there was nothing at all unusual in their lives, nothing that wasn’t as it should be.Not long after that, the group began turning up in the news.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It wasn’t quite a religion: their goal was to live in accordance with certain principles, and create a new, ideal humanity.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Naturally there was a sort of leader, and people gathered to listen to him preach, and then they established a commune deep in the mountains that was very nearly self-sufficient.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s the kind of group it was.Reports about this organization circulated so widely that even someone like me, who never watched the news, knew its name, if little else.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s how notorious it was.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"After the kidnappings came to light, the group may have disbanded, or maybe it still lives on secretly in some form.The truth is that in this world, things like that happen all the time.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I heard all sorts of wild tales from all kinds of customers at my mom’s club.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Many were almost beyond belief; many had to do with what was, in essence, kidnapping.Of course, on some level I’m hardly one to be held up as a paragon of normalcy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"After all, before I turned ten, I started going to my mom’s club and doing some of the stuff a hostess does, so I was raised in a pretty unconventional way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sure, I was protected by my mom and dad, since their influence kept customers from trying anything funny with me, but if I’d wanted to explore different avenues, my environment would have made anything possible.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"No matter how high-class you aspire to be, in the entertainment business you’re always trying to create a space where people can unload their irritations and frustrations, and I’m sure I must have been influenced by that in some ways.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That shadowy something is here inside me, just a little.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The whiff of something purple in the night, the sweet taste of darkness … it’s rubbed off on me, on my body.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Things were relatively okay at my mom’s club because her customers weren’t too bad, but even so I know just how slimy people can be, and how people like that are during the daytime.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They don’t get slimy at night because they’re drunk, they get slimy because they’re already slimy to begin with.I remembered hearing people chatting at the club about that incident, and watching reports on the TV there.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Only it had gotten all mixed up in my mind with other similar stories, and I couldn’t pick out any episodes in my memory that related specifically to Nakajima.Nakajima’s mother never, ever gave up.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She would go on every TV show and make herself available to every magazine, doing missing-person shows and having psychics look for her son, doing news programs, special features … it’s not an exaggeration to say that there was never a day when you didn’t see her somewhere.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She went on putting herself out there on a regular basis, refusing to let people forget.More than the event itself, she was what made the most powerful impression.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She always spoke extremely calmly, only said what she was certain of, hardly ever shed a tear, and always looked straight ahead.I could tell that until she found her son, nothing she ate would ever taste good, when she slept her dreams would always be nightmares, never light and easy, and no scenery would ever move her—she would just keep staring ahead into the distance, at her absent son.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
She would go on trying to connect.Her endurance was astonishing.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was like she was reeling in a tiny, tiny thread, slender as a cobweb, which only occasionally caught the light, and she would never miss it when it did—that’s how focused she was.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was love, and willpower.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You could see it in her expression, as if it were painted there.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She had this look on her face that told you all she could do was keep gazing at that one point, holding on to her faith, because if she ever so much as wondered if her son might be dead, then he really would die.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Her face could have been the model for every mother in this world, or the face of a bodhisattva.Then, finally, they found Nakajima.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"All the energy his mother had devoted to the search, distributing flyers all across the country, putting up photographs, going on TV until she was completely worn out—it had paid off.A boy who had escaped from the group was picked up in a village at the foothills of a mountain.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Someone who had seen Nakajima’s mother on TV wondered if maybe this might be her son, and called the police.It was such major news at the time, I can’t understand why I didn’t remember it, even just a little.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I guess I never imagined it could have anything to do with my future.Wow, that’s awful, how terrible, I wonder what I’d do if it were me?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I must have entertained these thoughts for about a second, and then they vanished.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"After all, I had a mom and dad, and my life was just beginning.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It’s amazing to realize how ignorant I was.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And how innocent.Things keep coming around and around in this world, it’s all crammed violently together, two parts of the same skin.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I didn’t realize that.I doubt I’ll ever understand how the three of them feel, no matter how long I live.And ironically, it’s that inability that puts them at ease.So there’s actually a reason for someone like me to exist in this world.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even before I start thinking about stuff like that, whether there is or isn’t a reason, in some place that exists prior to such thoughts, an enormous wheel is spinning, and I’m caught up inescapably in its motion.I’m its slave, almost.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m free to think what I like, but it’s all settled in advance.Ever perceptive, Nakajima knew it as soon as he saw me that evening.“Ah.”He must have sensed the turmoil in my heart as I stepped through the door.Because that’s what he said, the second I took my shoes off and looked up.And then he tried to act like he didn’t know, going on with his cleaning.Nakajima was extraordinarily finicky what it came to keeping things neat, and he cleaned the apartment so frequently it made me feel kind of guilty.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When I came home, everything would seem weirdly sterile—even the edges of the books were aligned.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I couldn’t help feeling that I’d drawn the winning number in this relationship.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"What’s more, once he had started cleaning, he seemed unable to stop.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Maybe that’s what kept him going on this occasion, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Either way, he went on quietly cleaning.By then, I no longer felt like I could go on interacting with him the same way.As long as it had remained a mystery, I could have dealt with it—no matter how enormous a mystery it became.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Now that matters had gotten more specific, my imagination began supplying smells and textures.There’s a huge difference between “Something really, really terrible happened to me once” and “There was a period in my life when I was kidnapped and brainwashed.”Everything fell into place.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The terror that physical contact inspired in him, his fear of seeing his friends from those days, his mother’s seemingly unreasonable concern for him, his ability to cut his mind off from his body when he studied—all the delicious uncertainty was gone now, and in its place was a dank, oppressive weight.You know, I told myself, I’m not sure I can bear to hear the details—what his life there was actually like, why sex became so frightening to him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And maybe I’ll never get over that.After a long time, I asked him, “Why did you say ‘Ah’ before?”He stopped his cleaning, surprisingly, and looked at me.And after that he was the same old Nakajima I knew and was crazy about, just as pathetic and as cool as always.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The curly hair at the back of his neck, his slightly stooped posture, the way he went around the house so quietly—it was him, the same as ever.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His palms, too, felt just as dry as they always had.That set me at ease.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We had a history here, together, in this apartment.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That history was short, but it had nothing to do with his past.It was so flimsy, a puff of air would send it flying, but it was real.“I thought you’d figured something out,” Nakajima said honestly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Something about my past, I mean.”“How did you know?” I asked.“Oh, it’s happened with lots of people before—I can see it in people’s eyes,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“And I was always on pins and needles about that, wondering when you’d realize.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Of course, part of me wanted you to find out.… Do I disgust you now?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Do you want to break up?”I took Nakajima’s hand in mine and pressed it so hard, so hard against my heart that I was probably about to break his bones.“Don’t say that,” I said.I used the sort of tone I might have used with a son.And like a child Nakajima mumbled, “I’m sorry,” and we went back to our lives.I cooked dinner, and Nakajima continued cleaning.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We worked in silence, like people the night before a move.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Like we were starting life over again.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Or like we had been doing this for a century already.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Setting all kinds of things aside, willing to go back to the first days, if that’s what it took, like Adam and Eve.Nakajima’s past would always be there, so the foundation could crumble at any moment.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s what happens, I realized, when people destroy other people.We had finished eating when Nakajima spoke.“Can we go see your mural?”“If you want to.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
But I don’t know—it’s night.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Wouldn’t it be better to go in the daytime, when you can see better?”“I’ll go during the day, too, of course.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I just thought we could go now, take a walk.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m assuming it’s finished, right?”I figured we could go to see it whenever, so I hadn’t actually told him it was done.“All right, let’s go,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“It’s still early enough that the guard will let us in if I tell him I forgot something.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
He knows me by now.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There’s a street light near the wall, so I doubt it will be too dark to see anyway, but just in case we can take that giant flashlight.”The scents of spring hung over the dark street; the stars seemed hazy.As we walked, Nakajima started talking.“I was going to a summer camp run by this school I was going to, and somehow I got lost, I ended up deep in the mountains, wandering along the highway, and these people picked me up in their car, and that was it, I’d been kidnapped.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"This was long before cell phones, of course.”The story had begun.The words kept coming, like water overflowing, refusing to stop.He’s like a broken machine, I thought.Walking on, talking on, his arms folded over his chest.All I could do was nod.“Can you imagine what it’s like to be kidnapped?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Did it ever occur to you that you’d have to learn to like your kidnappers?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because that’s the only way you can survive.“Do you understand what that means?“First, they erased my memory.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
With hypnotism and drugs.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And they made me believe that the place we were in wasn’t in Japan.“I was a smart kid, so I knew how to resist the hypnotism.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I had a vague memory of this technique I’d read about in a book, and I figured I’d try whatever I could, and somehow I managed to make it work.“What you had to do was practice a kind of autosuggestion, you make yourself remember a given person whenever you see a particular object, and since I was in Izu I knew the ocean had to be somewhere nearby, so I hypnotized myself into remembering my mother whenever I saw the ocean or if I found myself standing on the shore.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
After that I just let them do what they wanted with me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was scary, but in the end it worked.“Several months later, when we went down to the beach one very cold night for meditation practice, I remembered my mom.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It took a few days after that for me to recall that we were in Japan, and to think I might have been kidnapped.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There were a number of families in the group, parents and children both, like Mino and Chii and their mother, and I had gotten so used to it being that way that I almost took it for granted.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Their mother wasn’t living in the same room as them—the group had some ideological reason for that—but they put us together, and we all slept in a row.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Holding hands, like the three strokes of the character for ‘river.’“During the daytime, teachers in different fields would come and lead discussions and study groups and stuff.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"For kids and adults both.“At first after I remembered I got so confused I thought I was going crazy, but I waited a few days without letting on about anything, and little by little I started analyzing the situation I was in.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I came up with a hypothesis about what must have happened, the thing that seemed closest to the truth, and in the end I made up my mind to escape.“It wouldn’t have been a surprise if I’d gone crazy then.“I had to go wild inside myself, fighting to keep my sanity.“People try instinctively to take the easy route, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We shy away from pain.“So I didn’t want to believe that the people I was living with then, day after day, were bad, and my mind would drift off on its own, trying to think that the things I had remembered were fake, that they were the lie.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I hated the thought of leaving Mino and Chii, there was no ambiguity in that, and it frightened me to think of what might happen to them if I escaped and the police came.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"At times like that, your thoughts are inevitably drawn to the worst-case scenario.“Is this really a foreign country?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"No, it has to be Japan.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I was born here, I grew up in this place.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"No, that’s not true.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I was kidnapped.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Kidnapping is bad—I’ve got to do something.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But they’re all such good people, how could I accuse them of something like that?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
How long have I been here?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Has it been a really long time?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I wonder if Mom is still alive … I was bewildered.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Is this woman I keep remembering my mom?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"No, I know she isn’t, she’s just a vision I created because I want a mom so badly … Everything got tangled up like that, the thoughts kept hounding me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I don’t say that lightly: my mind was really being torn to pieces, stripped of everything inside it, and I started getting very unstable.“So finally I got up the courage to talk with Mino and Chii.“And this is what Mino said, late at night, in a whisper:“ ‘I think you’re probably right, Nobu.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ve been living here with everyone ever since I was a baby, so I don’t really know about certain things, but I think you were probably stolen.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I mean, it’s odd that your mom isn’t here.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And this is Japan.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s for sure.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even though everyone says it isn’t.’“He had no idea how it might affect him and his sister, but still he told me his opinion.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"In a sense, he was risking his life, and I can’t ever be grateful enough to him for that, as long as I live.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even though it is so hard for me to go and see them.“The reason Chii is bedridden, and the reason I get so exhausted sometimes—it’s not just a matter of emotional trauma.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
All the drugs they gave us destroyed our livers.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Mino has gotten a lot better, but I don’t think he’s completely recovered, either.“Not long after the group disbanded, Mino and Chii’s mother died of liver cancer.“The house they live in now was originally used as a kind of combined storage and meeting room for the shrine, and that’s why my mother and I were able to live there a while, and when Mino and Chii’s mother died we decided to invite them to live there, without paying any rent or anything.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
We wanted them to feel free to stay there forever.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"After all, part of me still isn’t sure whether what I did was really best for them.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Maybe they would have been better off if I hadn’t informed on the group when I escaped, and they could have just stayed there like that for the rest of their lives.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Sometimes I wonder.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So I wanted to find a way to help them out with their new lives, and to protect them from society.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
My mom felt exactly the same way.”Nakajima’s arms remained tightly folded across his chest.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I knew the street we were walking on very well, and yet it seemed somehow to be detached from the earth, subtly distorted.Plodding on with even steps, I listened.“The group hadn’t been living in that place all along—evidently they were moving around from place to place, all over Japan, looking for somewhere to settle.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
So all kinds of people were coming and going all the time.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It wasn’t at all unusual to suddenly see some face you didn’t recognize, or for someone who had been there to disappear, so it wasn’t hard for me to escape.“The thought that scared me the most was that maybe I’d keep going and going, but maybe I’d never arrive anywhere, and if I finally came to a populated area I’d find that it really was a foreign country, and I wouldn’t be able to communicate, and it would turn out that all those memories I’d had really were just an illusion.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t have a passport, so I would have no way of getting back to the ‘home’ I was thinking of anyway.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
So I’d just have to go back to the same place and live there again.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Without any hope.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
What if that turned out to be the truth?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
These thoughts plagued me endlessly.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That was the worst, it really was.“I started thinking that if that were the case, I’d rather just be dead.“If this little dream I’d cherished turned out not to be there for me to hold on to anymore, I mean.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Because it wasn’t just my mother I was dreaming of.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was the background against which I came into this world, the scent of freedom that wafted through my life, supported by all the hopes and the love my parents had for me, because back then, when I was still a kid, things like that were everything to me.“My head was spinning, and the world before me looked so dark, I was ready to lie down right there on the spot and die.“But I had Mino.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His words, etched deep in my mind, were my reality then.“I could count on Mino.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m sure I would have despaired even more if he hadn’t told me we were in Japan, probably in a place called Shimoda, even though no one ever said so.“He had been growing suspicious for some time as a result of information he got from his mysterious sister.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He was secretly afraid that the adults might learn about her strange powers, and then their mother would end up in an even stronger position in the group, and they would have to stay even longer than they might otherwise.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He tried his best to hide the things she said from them, but it was really hard.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
So I had no choice but to save them.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I don’t know if they would agree that what I did deserves to be called ‘saving,’ though.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"After all, both their parents were part of the group—at least I’m pretty sure their father was, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m sure their wounds, the despair they felt, must have been a lot deeper than mine.“I think what Mino did for me, his noble sacrifice, destroyed any sense of stability he’d had.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And Chii’s, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And even if that stability was built on a lie, at the time it was still something they could rely on.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"After that, everything changed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And yet he wanted that change, although maybe he wanted it for us, in order to save me and Chii—and that act of love, more than anything, is the reason he can keep smiling the way he does, even now.“I trudged through the forest, thinking only of Mino’s words, and of my mother.“I get the sense that most people assume that when someone who’s been brainwashed comes out of it there’s a feeling of relief, that it’s like waking up, but it isn’t like that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You feel sort of dull, nothing is clear—it makes you miserable.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s the truth.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I felt like there was nothing good waiting for me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I would actually keep feeling that way for a long time.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Right then, though, making my way along that dark mountain road, I wasn’t worried about that, I was just fighting for my life.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Trying to keep from getting torn to pieces inside, trying to hold myself together.“Eventually I saw lights, and my heart started thumping, my head hurt so badly it felt like it was about to split, and all the scary stories I had ever heard weighed down on me until I could hardly bear it anymore.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
But I kept walking.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I stepped, almost collapsed, into the light.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I didn’t know what it was, but there was a fence around the space, and I had the sensation of something beautiful watching me, so I stumbled over in that direction, and there was a stable with five horses lined up in their stalls, looking out at me.“For some reason the horses didn’t get nervous or start acting up when they saw me; they simply stood there watching me, perfectly still.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Their black eyes and their lustrous coats made me feel completely calm.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I stretched out a hand and touched one of them.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I wasn’t afraid he would bite me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I just wanted to touch him, because he was so lovely.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"His skin felt warm, and then I caught a whiff of animal smell, and I loved the hard feel of his coat, stiff like grass—my eyes filled with tears.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The horse just kept looking at me, it didn’t seem to be thinking anything, his eyes were like two lakes, so gorgeous, drawing me in.“I’ll be grateful to that horse for the rest of my life.“That horse, with its wild, natural eyes, brought me back, made me all right.“I pulled myself together again, got a grip.… The place I was in, it was a small riding club.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I went and knocked on the clubhouse door.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"People who had come in from riding and the couple who owned the club were inside chatting over coffee, and they were pretty taken aback when they saw me, but the wife seemed to deduce immediately from how I looked that something was very wrong.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
She told me to come inside and sat me down at the back of the room and made me some coffee.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The coffee smelled good, but even better than that was her smell—she smelled like a mother.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The kind of bodily, nice scent of a mother who never lets her children out of her sight, who always thinks first of her kids—I smelled it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And it brought back such memories, it was so warm and familiar, that I cried and cried and couldn’t stop.“ ‘You’re Japanese, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"So this is Japan, after all?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Please, call the police.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I don’t even know my own name right now, honest.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I was kidnapped.’“I kept repeating those words, crying all the while.“And then one of the riders said he recognized me, he had seen my mother on TV, and so right away the woman’s husband called the police.“ ‘You can tell us the details later’, the woman said, and gave me more coffee and some curry rice.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was lots of meat in it, and I realized how much I had missed that, too.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When I was with that group, we weren’t allowed to eat any meat at all.“And it came back to me that this is what a mother is, this is the kind of being she is—it doesn’t matter what the situation is, if someone’s cold she warms him, and if he’s hungry she wants to feed him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I remembered that with such intensity, so vividly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It was okay for me to remember now, I realized, and I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t cry anymore.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It took time for my heart to unclench itself.”We arrived at the center.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Nakajima stopped talking while I chatted with the guard.Then, as we walked through the small gate, I asked my first question.“And you and your mom went to live in that house by the lake after you got back?”Nakajima nodded.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"After that, he started speaking again, but less rapidly.“I was almost ten at the time, but after I returned my mother and I slept in the same futon every night, with her hugging me tight.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And for about three months, every morning when we woke up she would look at my face and burst out sobbing.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I remember the suffocating feeling I got, even when my eyes were closed—the sense that someone is staring at you, at your face.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I knew if I opened my eyes I’d see her, her face swollen from crying, so I just lay there, pretending to be asleep.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It felt so oppressive, I’m sure it was even worse than what you feel being with me now, dealing with the things you don’t know about me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
It was so over the top that my father got fed up and left her.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That’s how bad it was.” Nakajima smiled.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I worried that she might go crazy, and so I asked if she could join me for counseling, even though it was really only meant for me, and we did go together, for a long time.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Even then, with her in that condition, she did whatever was necessary to protect me when the media came to do a story on us, and she told me we were going to make up for the time I’d lost—sometimes we’d go places, amusement parks and so on, and my father would come along, too.“Apparently my face was expressionless in the beginning, no matter what we were doing, I was always stiff, but that was just because I couldn’t find a way to show what I was feeling.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Inside, I was having all kinds of emotions, but it was impossible to let them out.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But day by day, slowly, over time, something was warming up in me, thawing.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I started to love my mother again, and gradually I went back to being myself.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I remember it all very clearly, that whole process.“And then, after things had settled down somewhat, our doctor suggested that we should go take it easy somewhere, and we went and lived in that house, by the edge of the lake.”That explains why he’s like this, I thought.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s because he experienced something so awful himself that he’s determined, more than most people, not to be a burden to anyone, to me, and to take care of himself.Nakajima continued.“It’s not like I was being abused the whole time or anything, I was simply being trained by people who wanted to create a race of superhumans, so in a sense they were all very nice, the meals were always good, with lots of seafood, and I had friends I could play with every day, so it was actually pretty fun.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But as far as the adults there were concerned, my relationships with them were all the same, homogeneous, there was no emotional involvement like there had been in my relationship with my mother.“I realized then, in the most physical way, that being logical and clear-headed isn’t at all the same thing as having everything the same, unruffled.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"When you’re in a state of homogeneity, it means you’ve lost yourself.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s how you’re able to get that way in the first place.“All that love my mother sort of forced on me right after I escaped, it was like a soup that was too strong, it penetrated too deep.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Her emotions were so intense—they were like gaudy clothes or something, with too many frills.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s how I saw it.“In the end, I think it was my fault my mother and father separated, and she died sooner than she should have.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That seemed to me like the most natural thing in the world, and I’m not thinking in some weird unscientific way or anything.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It happened because she used so much energy; she chose to do that, in return for getting me back.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
What she put into me was taken away from her.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She knew it would be like that, and still she used that energy.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I really believe that, even now.“Of course, I don’t necessarily feel like I have that long to live myself, and so back then it was natural for me to think, What are you doing, I don’t need this life, Mom, it’s yours!",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I didn’t have the strength to pray for that to happen, really deep down, the way my mother did.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I could never compete with her, I realized that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She gave it everything she had, squeezing every last drop of strength in her body into following the tiny thread that led her to me.“I’ve been broken in all kinds of ways, and so for a long time now I’ve had the sense that I won’t be able to make it through my life in a normal way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But thanks to my mother, somehow or other I’ve been able to balance the books, and things have turned out really well.“Except it still makes me feel a little sad to think that the whole time she was searching for me, wearing herself out, I was having sashimi and laughing with my friends, and getting my first taste of the joys of sex,” Nakajima said.“Sorry, I cry when I talk about all this,” he added.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And then he really cried.Nakajima and his mother had spent every day together, like lovers, trying to reclaim their lost time, and that ended up being the best period of his life, and providing his most precious memories.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I doubted anything better than that would ever happen to him.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He lived knowing that he had already experienced perfection; that, no doubt, was what gave him a certain aura of sadness, and a sense of flexibility.“Emotions aren’t much, though.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I understand that quite well.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Just as my memories of living with my mother by the lake are the most precious I have now, in the days after I started living with her I was always thinking of the ocean, how much fun I’d always had there, playing with Mino and Chii.… The waves were always rough at Shimoda, and we would see each other one second, and then the next we’d lose sight of each other.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We’d laugh our heads off for no reason, fall down, get sucked in by the waves, and play so hard that we got out of breath.“When I try to gather up all the good things, I get an infinite number of combinations of events that fall under that heading, and if I try to gather up the painful things, those memories start coming out, and either way they’ll just keep coming, called up out of my brain or my heart or whatever, and none of it really means very much.“Just because things turned out badly in the end doesn’t mean that anything has changed in my relationship with my mother.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Everything is still there, the same as always: the fact that we walked slowly around that lake together, holding hands, and the way my friends and I laughed in the ocean, the fact that I was looking at a seagull then.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
None of it has changed.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s neither good nor bad, as I see it, the scenes are just there inside me, forever, and their mass remains the same.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Of course, it’s true that sometimes the pink at sunrise somehow seems brighter than the pink at sunset, and that when you’re feeling down the landscape seems darker, too—you see things through the filter of your own sensibility.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But the things themselves, out there, they don’t change.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They existed, and that’s all there is to it.“Maybe it’s not even accurate to say things turned out badly.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sure, an accumulation of little incidents ended up ripping my life to shreds, and my mother swept all those pieces up with her too-passionate hands and jammed them together again any which way.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
That turned me into a kind of patchy guy.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But I have my life, I’m living it.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It’s twisted, exhausting, uncertain, and full of guilt, but nonetheless, there’s something there.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And that something is always greater than these emotions of mine.”Nakajima sounded, the way he murmured these words, as if he had only grudgingly decided to speak them.It was easy for me to listen, since I’d never been broken like him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s how people are, pretty much, wherever in the world you might go.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There’s no need to forgive every mistake, to learn to like the bad things, we tell ourselves, and so we forgive just enough, in an easy sort of way.Take my mom, for instance.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"She was clumsy and terrible at math, she was nothing but a Mama-san at a bar, she had tons of plastic surgery, she died young, she had a child out of wedlock.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Or my totally uncool dad, acting like a dipstick in that cheesy Italian restaurant.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You need to have all that stuff, because that’s where it all begins.I’m sure it’s even harder for Nakajima.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Because the scale is so huge.But who knows, maybe if he can get used to the fact that each day is another dull repetition of the same old thing, being with the same people all the time, nothing but the little leaps of your heart to put a splash of color in the world … if he can get accustomed to that, maybe, little by little, something will start to change.Not only was the street light shining on the wall, but the nearly full moon was shining pretty brightly, too—we could see the mural fairly well even from a distance.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Certainly the colors would have shown up better in the daytime, but there was a kind of mysterious air to it, the way the outermost edges faded off into the darkness.“See, I painted everyone in over here,” I said, with a certain amount of pride.“Wow, so this is what it’s like.” Nakajima gazed at the mural for a long time, which was nice.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It made me happy to see the same expression on his face that he gets when he’s studying really hard.I felt how important the simplest things were, like feeling proud, finding something funny, stretching yourself, retreating into yourself.Clearly I was recovering, too, from all kinds of things.I wanted to get back on my own two feet first, and then lead him by the hand down the path we would take together.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Like the first time we went to see Mino and Chii, drawing instinctively closer to him, without any hidden motives.Gazing all the while at the picture, very slowly, I explained.My voice reverberated through the dark, empty yard.“This is you.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You’re taking it easy in the shade of the tree, eating a banana.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And this is your mother—she’s always hovering around you, smiling.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And here’s the lake, and obviously this is the shrine.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And then over here, this is Mino.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"He’s laughing, making tea.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
See how small he is?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"And Chii, sleeping in her canopied bed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
A little monkey princess.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"No one else knows what it means, but that doesn’t matter—it’s a happy world.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
No one can destroy that happiness.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"People will see this wall without having any idea what it means, and then eventually it will be knocked down, and it won’t exist anymore.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But deep down in people’s subconscious, this happy group of monkeys, all of you, will still be there, just a little.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Isn’t that nice?”Nakajima nodded without speaking.“Lately I’m always crying,” he said then, snuffling a bit, so I didn’t look at him.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
What the hell?,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I was thinking, a bit ruefully.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"This isn’t love, it’s volunteer work.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"This should be the scene where the guy is moved and embraces the girl, right?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"C’mon!We stood there looking at the wall for ages, so long we started getting cold.Whenever I think of this mural in the future, I’ll remember this night.No matter where we may be, or what we’re doing.“I don’t really know how to ask this, Chihiro, but did they … did they look unhappy to you?”Nakajima had been walking in silence when he blurted this out, his voice hoarse.I thought hard.I had the feeling that if I lied now, everything would turn into a lie.There’s the surface, and then what we see under the surface.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Delicious tea, a dusty room, the lake glittering outside the window …I tried my best to bring it all together into a single impression, layer upon layer, like a slice of mille-feuille.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And then I answered.“They didn’t seem unhappy to me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Not at all,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“They didn’t seem especially happy, either.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"They looked like they must have unhappy moments, and happy moments, too.”“I’m glad.” Nakajima seemed relieved.Talking with him could be like a battle of wills, but I didn’t mind.In fact, I kind of liked it.“You know, Chihiro, it’s true.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"You’re really extremely unusual,” Nakajima said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“You don’t use emotional violence against people, or hardly ever anyway.”“That’s not true,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“I’ve got scary sides, too, I’m sure.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Everyone does.”“I’m not saying you don’t have any.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
I’m just saying you’ve got less of that.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
And that’s good enough for me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I was afraid of losing you, so I didn’t want to get too close.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"But that didn’t matter, you were still there every day, in your own world, free from worries about other people.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There’s nothing uncertain about you, out there painting, moving your hands and your body, and I feel so at ease because of that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
Except that you’re so optimistic—that kind of worries me.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I get afraid, because I can’t trust that.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
But I’m drawn to you.,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Sometimes I feel this urge to just go ahead and mess all this up, but I can’t, because I love you.”Nakajima smiled, just a little.“It’s great you can talk like that now, isn’t it?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"That’s progress,” I said truthfully.“Hmph.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’m not going to Paris with you if you’re going to be like that,” he said, sounding like a child.“All right.” I laughed.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“Why don’t you go by yourself, then?”“That’s fine with me.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ll go all alone, and I’ll be waiting.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’ve been thinking, though—sometime do you think you’d come to Shimoda with me?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"I’d like to go visit that place eventually, and go to that riding club and say thank you to the people there, and above all to the horses.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It would still be too hard for me to do that now, though.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There’s no way, it’d be totally impossible.”“Why don’t we go when we come back from Paris for a visit, then, just make it part of the trip?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"We could go swimming together if we go in the summer.”Nakajima and I ambled off through the familiar neighborhood, just like always, chatting back and forth—not in a particularly happy way, but not in a sad way, either.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"There was a real sense of comfort, and yet at the same time it felt oddly tense.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"The feeling that every little thing we said, these conversations, at any moment they could stop being possible, and so they were precious, it was that feeling, and the sense of the miracle of this shared moment, here and now.Why were we so far apart, even when we were together?It was a nice loneliness, like the sensation of washing your face in cold water.“But before we do that,” I said, “let’s go back to the lake, to see Mino and Chii.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Let’s go see the lake when the cherry trees are in bloom, all around it.”“You’d go again?",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Really?” Nakajima said.“If we go enough, maybe things will be all right,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"“All kinds of things.”Here we were, two ridiculously fragile people, sliding along on a very thin layer of ice all the time, each of us ready to slip and take the other down at any moment, the most unsteady of couples—and yet I believed what I had said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"It would be all right.Going along like that, I felt like we were high above the clouds, shining.“I’m sure they’d like that, too,” Nakajima said.“Maybe someday I’ll even be able to see Chii when she’s better, up and about.”That was unlikely, of course, but there’s nothing wrong with being a little hopeful.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
"Who says you can’t warm your frozen limbs in the faint heat of a flicker of hope?“For the time being, let’s go back home and I’ll make us some tea with some really good water,” I said.",Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
“Even if it won’t be as delicious as Mino’s.”,Banana Yoshimoto,The Lake
